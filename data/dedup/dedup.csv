The basic idea is to leverage the existing lighting infrastructure and apply trilateration to localize any devices with light sensing capability (e.g., a smartphone), using LED lamps as anchors. Through the design of Epsilon, we identify and tackle several technique challenges. In particular, we establish and experimentally verify the optical channel model for localization. We adopt BFSK and channel hopping to enable reliable location beaconing from multiple, uncoordinated light sources over the shared optical medium. We handle realistic situations towards robust localization, for example, we exploit user involvement to resolve the ambiguity in case of insufficient LED anchors. We have implemented the Epsilon system and evaluated it with a small scale hardware testbed as well as moderate-size simulations. Experimental results confirmed the effectiveness of Epsilon: the 90th percentile accuracies are 0.4m, 0.7m and 0.8m for three typical office environments. Even in the extreme situation with a single light, the 90th percentile accuracy is 1.1m. We believe that visible light based localization is promising to significantly improve the positioning accuracy, despite few open problems in practice.",,

As the capabilities of robotic software frameworks increase, the setup difficulty and learning curve for new users also increase. If the entry barriers for configuring and using the software on robots is too high, even the most powerful of frameworks are useless. A growing need exists in robotic software engineering to aid users in getting started with, and customizing, the software framework as necessary for particular robotic applications. In this paper a case study is presented for the best practices found for lowering the barrier of entry in the MoveIt! framework, an open-source tool for mobile manipulation in ROS, that allows users to 1) quickly get basic motion planning functionality with minimal initial setup, 2) automate its configuration and optimization, and 3) easily customize its components. A graphical interface that assists the user in configuring MoveIt! is the cornerstone of our approach, coupled with the use of an existing standardized robot model for input, automatically generated robot-specific configuration files, and a plugin-based architecture for extensibility. These best practices are summarized into a set of barrier to entry design principles applicable to other robotic software. The approaches for lowering the entry barrier are evaluated by usage statistics, a user survey, and compared against our design objectives for their effectiveness to users.",,

We present CHERI, a hybrid capability model that extends the 64-bit MIPS ISA with byte-granularity memory protection. We demonstrate that CHERI enables language memory model enforcement and fault isolation in hardware rather than software, and that the CHERI mechanisms are easily adopted by existing programs for efficient in-program memory safety. In contrast to past capability models, CHERI complements, rather than replaces, the ubiquitous page-based protection mechanism, providing a migration path towards deconflating data-structure protection and OS memory management. Furthermore. CHERI adheres to a strict RISC philosophy: it maintains a load-store architecture and requires only single-cycle instructions, and supplies protection primitives to the compiler, language runtime, and operating system. We demonstrate a mature FPGA implementation that runs the FreeBSD operating system with a full range of software and an open-source application suite compiled with an extended LLVM to use CHERI memory protection. A limit study compares published memory safety mechanisms in terms of instruction count and memory overheads. The study illustrates that CHERI is performance-competitive even while providing assurance and greater flexibility with simpler hardware.",,

Researchers report their findings, which are strengthened as other independent groups in the scientific community share similar outcomes. In the many scientific fields where software has become a fundamental tool for capturing and analyzing data, this requirement of reproducibility implies that reliable and comprehensive software platforms and tools should be made available to the scientific community. The tools will empower them and the public to verify, through practice, the reproducibility of observations that are reported in the scientific literature. Medical image analysis is one of the fields in which the use of computational resources, both software and hardware, are an essential platform for performing experimental work. In this arena, the introduction of the Insight Toolkit (ITK) in 1999 has transformed the field and facilitates its progress by accelerating the rate at which algorithmic implementations are developed, tested, disseminated and improved. By building on the efficiency and quality of open source methodologies, ITK has provided the medical image community with an effective platform on which to build a daily workflow that incorporates the true scientific practices of reproducibility verification. This article describes the multiple tools, methodologies, and practices that the ITK community has adopted, refined, and followed during the past decade, in order to become one of the research communities with the most modern reproducibility verification infrastructure. For example, 207 contributors have created over 2400 unit tests that provide over 84% code line test coverage.

In all, the paper analyses three challenges that the development of open source urban infrastructures is posing to the institutions of urban governance and property: the evolving shape and composition of urban ecologies; the technical and design challenges brought about by open source urban projects; and the social organisation of the ‘right to infrastructure’ as a political, active voice in urban governance.

With respect to power-switch open-circuit fault diagnosis, the majority of the proposed voltage-based approaches require additional hardware, increasing the system cost. As a result, industry acceptance may be low. This paper proposes a new voltage-based approach-without additional sensors-for open-circuit fault diagnosis in closed-loop controlled pulsewidth-modulation (PWM) ac voltage source converters, by using the information contained in the reference voltages available from the control system. The robustness against false alarms of the proposed technique is improved by employing a voltage observer, in order to estimate the actual converter voltages. It has been proven that the algorithm is insensitive to parameter errors; thus, its effectiveness is not compromised. In order to assess the applicability of the diagnostic technique, it is integrated into the control system of a permanent-magnet-synchronous-machine drive, with regenerative capabilities, together with three of the most widely used PWM control strategies: hysteresis current control, direct torque control, and space vector modulation. The technique performance is analyzed in detail by means of several experimental results.",,

Hence cheap off-the-shelf Wi-Fi dongles can be used carry out advanced attacks. We demonstrate this by implementing five low-layer attacks using open source Atheros firmware. The first attack consists of unfair channel usage, giving the user a higher throughput while reducing that of others. The second attack defeats countermeasures designed to prevent unfair channel usage. The third attack performs continuous jamming, making the channel unusable for other devices. For the fourth attack we implemented a selective jammer, allowing one to jam specific frames already in the air. The fifth is a novel channel-based Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attack, enabling reliable manipulation of encrypted traffic. These low-layer attacks facilitate novel attacks against higher-layer protocols. To demonstrate this we show how our MitM attack facilitates attacks against the Temporal Key Integrity Protocol (TKIP) when used as a group cipher. Since a substantial number of networks still use TKIP as their group cipher, this shows that weaknesses in TKIP have a higher impact than previously thought.",,

Hardware released under free licenses is known as free and open source hardware (FOSH). The availability of these FOSH designs has a large value to those with access to digital manufacturing methods and particularly for scientists with needs for highly-customized low-volume production products. It is challenging to use traditional funding models to support the necessary investment of resources in FOSH development because of the difficulty in quantifying the value of the result. In order to overcome that challenge and harvest the current opportunity in both low-cost scientific equipment and consumer products, this article evaluates the following methods to quantify the value of FOSH design including: 1) downloaded substitution valuation; 2) avoided reproduction valuation and 3) market savings valuation along with additional benefits related to market expansion, scientific innovation acceleration, educational enhancement and medical care improvement. The strengths and weaknesses of these methods are analyzed and the results show that the methods are relatively straight-forward to institute, based on reliable freely-available data, and that they minimize assumptions. A case study of a syringe pump with numerous scientific and medical applications is presented. The results found millions of dollars of economic value from a relatively simple scientific device being released under open-licenses representing orders of magnitude increase in value from conventional proprietary development. The inescapable conclusion of this study is that FOSH development should be funded by organizations interested in maximizing return on public investments particularly in technologies associated with science, medicine and education.",,

The overarching theme of these analyses is that hands-on components of courses tend to be formulaic, closed-ended, and at times outdated. To address these issues, we envision a novel platform that is not only a didactic tool but is also an experimental testbed for users to play with different ideas in evolutionary robotics (Nolfi and Floreano, 2000), neural networks, physical simulation, 3D printing, mechanical assembly, and embedded processing. Here, we introduce RoboGen™: an open-source software and hardware platform designed for the joint evolution of robot morphologies and controllers a la Sims (1994); Lipson and Pollack (2000); Bongard and Pfeifer (2003). Robo- Gen has been designed specifically to allow evolved robots to be easily manufactured via widely available desktop 3D-printers, and the use of simple, open-source, low-cost, offthe- shelf electronic components.

Nonetheless, the difficulty of disallowing them in language specifications causes real, and serious, problems. In the absence of such a specification, essentially all precise reasoning about non-trivial programs becomes impractical. This remains a critical open problem in the specifications of Java, C, and C++, among others.

Successful hardware design obfuscation would severely limit a supply chain adversary's capability if not preventing all supply chain attacks. However, not all designs are obfuscatable in traditional technologies. We propose to achieve ASIC design obfuscation based on embedded reconfigurable logic which is determined by the end user and unknown to any party in the supply chain. Combined with other security techniques, embedded reconfigurable logic can provide the root of ASIC design obfuscation, data confidentiality and tamper-proofness. As a case study, we evaluate hardware-based code injection attacks and reconfiguration-based instruction set obfuscation based on an open source SPARC processor LEON2. We prevent program monitor Trojan attacks and increase the area of a minimum code injection Trojan with a 1KB ROM by 2.38% for every 1% area increase of the LEON2 processor.",,

One critical application is the localization of noise pollution sources in urban environments, due to an increasing body of evidence linking noise pollution to adverse effects on human health. Current noise mapping techniques often fail to accurately identify noise pollution sources, because they rely on the interpolation of a limited number of scattered sound sensors. Aiming to produce accurate noise pollution maps, we developed the SoundCompass, a low-cost sound sensor capable of measuring local noise levels and sound field directionality. Our first prototype is composed of a sensor array of 52 Microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) microphones, an inertial measuring unit and a low-power field-programmable gate array (FPGA). This article presents the SoundCompass’s hardware and firmware design together with a data fusion technique that exploits the sensing capabilities of the SoundCompass in a wireless sensor network to localize noise pollution sources.

We propose F-SEFI, a Fine-grained Soft Error Fault Injector, as a tool for profiling software robustness against soft errors. In this paper we utilize soft error injection to mimic the impact of errors on logic circuit behavior. Leveraging the open source virtual machine hypervisor QEMU, F-SEFI enables users to modify emulated machine instructions to introduce soft errors. F-SEFI can control what application, which sub-function, when and how to inject soft errors with different granularities, without interference to other applications that share the same environment. F-SEFI does this without requiring revisions to the application source code, compilers or operating systems. We discuss the design constraints for F-SEFI and the specifics of our implementation. We demonstrate use cases of F-SEFI on several benchmark applications to show how data corruption can propagate to incorrect results.",,

Such architectures exhibit non-uniform memory access latency as well as non-uniform thread communication costs. Unfortunately, traditional shared-everything database management systems are designed for uniform inter-core communication speeds. This causes unpredictable access latencies in the critical path. While lack of data locality may be a minor nuisance on systems with fewer than 4 processors, it becomes a serious scalability limitation on larger systems due to accesses to centralized data structures. In this paper, we propose ATraPos, a storage manager design that is aware of the non-uniform access latencies of multisocket systems. ATraPos achieves good data locality by carefully partitioning the data as well as internal data structures (e.g., state information) to the available processors and by assigning threads to specific partitions. Furthermore, ATraPos dynamically adapts to the workload characteristics, i.e., when the workload changes, ATraPos detects the change and automatically revises the data partitioning and thread placement to fit the current access patterns and hardware topology. We prototype ATraPos on top of an open-source storage manager Shore-MT and we present a detailed experimental analysis with both synthetic and standard (TPC-C and TATP) benchmarks. We show that ATraPos exhibits performance improvements of a factor ranging from 1.4 to 6.7x for a wide collection of transactional workloads. In addition, we show that the adaptive monitoring and partitioning scheme of ATraPos poses a negligible cost, while it allows the system to dynamically and gracefully adapt when the workload changes.",,

All these requirements cannot be achieved by using software-only solutions, but rather with hardware-based platforms such as NetFPGA. The main obstacle when using this type of open source FPGA-based solution is the cost of development, in both time and hardware development skills required. The spread of new circuit synthesis tools using high-level languages opens the door for the development of hardware-based networking applications with reasonable development effort, compared to the use of traditional hardware description languages. In this article, we describe how existing open source hardware-based platforms for networking applications will be fueled by the change in the programming model of FPGAs provided by modern high-level synthesis tools. For this, we implemented a network flow monitor using high-level languages and compared the effort spent with respect to a traditional hardware development cycle.

Historically, good platforms for a controls laboratory have been expensive, because the equipment has typically been very specialized for educational purposes. Moreover, the equipment often is not physically robust in the face of student manhandling, creating major difficulties and costs in maintaining such a lab. The advent of inexpensive open-source controller hardware is revolutionizing this situation because it is now possible to have good controls-hardware capability at relatively low cost. The Arduino Mega 2560, in particular, is supported by Matlab, Simulink and LabView, and thus provides a great deal of flexibility in developing laboratory procedures for students to study controls. The Arduino is an open-source electronics prototyping platform based on flexible, easy-to-use hardware and software. The “motor shield” is an add-on (daughterboard) to the Arduino that further enables control of dc motors. This paper explains a method and hardware to connect an Arduino to a separately-powered dc-motor unit. Matlab and Simulink provide full support of the Arduino board for feedback-controller design.

MCRs are miniature multifunctional devices usually constrained in both size and on-board power supply. The design process for MCRs is time consuming and resource intensive, as it involves the development of custom hardware and software components. In this work, we present the STORM Lab Modular Architecture for Capsules (SMAC), a modular open source architecture for MCRs aiming to provide the MCRs research community with a tool for shortening the design and development time for capsule robots. The SMAC platform consists of both hardware modules and firmware libraries that can be used for developing MCRs. In particular, the SMAC modules are miniature boards of uniform diameter (i.e., 9.8 mm) that are able to fulfill five different functions: signal coordination combined with wireless data transmission, sensing, actuation, powering and vision/illumination. They are small in size, low power, and have reconfigurable software libraries for the Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL), which has been proven to work reliably for different types of MCRs. A design template for a generic SMAC application implementing a robust communication protocol is presented in this work, together with its finite state machine abstraction, capturing all the architectural components involved. The reliability of the wireless link is assessed for different levels of data transmission power and separation distances. The current consumption for each SMAC module is quantified and the timing of a SMAC radio message transmission is characterized. Finally, the applicability of SMAC in the field of MCRs is discussed by analysing examples from the literature.",,

Having access to education and the means of production appears as the major factors for the implementation of this goal. 3D printing is a revolutionary technology that has the potential to bring digital manufacturing to everyone. However, the rise of personal fabrication requires an increase in printing quality, a reduction on machine cost and an increase in knowledge shared by the open hardware community. The purpose of this paper is to explore the development of a new Open Hardware printer project to address these points. Design/methodology/approach - The authors have designed and constructed a low-cost photopolymer-based 3D printer called BeamMaker. The printer is connected to a host computer and a digital-light-processing projector. This work details the design process and how improvements were implemented to reach good printing quality. The authors provide public access to the instructions, software, source code, parts list, user manual and STL and CAD files. Findings - The BeamMaker printer can build objects with a high surface quality that is comparable to the quality obtained by industrial photopolymer-based 3D printers. When testing the ability to print a sample cylinder, the printer shows higher accuracy when compared to other personal 3D printers. These findings are encouraging considering the low cost of the system. Research limitations/implications - The printing failure rate of the system has not been measured to date. The system requires some improvements to produce large objects. Practical implications - The printer cost is just USD380. This is five to eight times less expensive than popular personal 3D printers available today. The cost is 30 times less expensive than a personal photopolymer 3D printer produced by a main commercial company and yet producing results of similar quality. The authors expect good avenues for collaboration from the open-source community to continue improving these systems. Social implications - The high cost of current personal 3D printers prevents users from developing countries from entering into the open hardware trend. A dramatic reduction in printer cost such as that explored in this work might contribute to the real democratization of personal fabrication. Originality/value - The authors report on the status of three other photopolymer-based personal 3D printer projects. To the best of the authors' knowledge, BeamMaker is the first fully open hardware 3D printer project which uses this technology.",,

El uso de estas herramientas permite la construcción de sistemas complejos haciendo uso de software y hardware diseñado por terceros, ofreciendo un gran flexibilidad gracias a la disponibilidad del código y circuitos esquemáticos; de esta manera se logra ajustar el comportamiento de las aplicaciones obteniendo algunos beneficios como: reducción de tiempo de desarrollo, expansión de aplicaciones, modularidad y corrección de problemas de una manera práctica. Adicionalmente, estos sistemas son de extrema utilidad para el caso en el cual sea necesario reducir costos, muy común en ambientes educativos de nuestra región que cuentan con recursos muy limitados. La calidad de las herramientas para el desarrollo de las aplicaciones es muy buena y no tienen nada que envidiarle a equivalentes comerciales. Con estas aplicaciones se pretende también involucrar a los estudiantes en proyectos a nivel de trabajos de fin de materia y/o proyectos de grado en la cultura del open Source tanto de software como de Hardware.Particularmente, en el GIDET se ha venido desarrollando aplicaciones con microcontroladores PIC’s y ATMEL, para robótica y otras áreas apoyados en el IDEA (Integrated Development Enviroment for coding Algorithms), un software de ambiente gráfico desarrollado en la región, el cual permite la construcción de programas a partir de algoritmos diseñados en diagramas de flujo y/o lenguajes de alto nivel (C, C++), con el IDEA además de diseñar la aplicación al finalizar es posible descargar el programa ejecutable en sistemas basados en microcontroladores. Los sistemas con los que se han realizado las aplicaciones open hardware utilizan el mismo sistema de conexión de los módulos arduino, lo que permite la conexión simultánea de varias tarjetas para la construcción de prototipos con cierta complejidad. Por su diseño basado en arduino, se puedan utilizar con ellos los módulos que ofrecen otras empresas que utilizan la misma tecnología. Los módulos son de arquitectura abierta. En el IDEA es posible contar simultáneamente con las rutinas y planos del hardware requeridos para la construcción de la aplicación.

Our system architecture is centered around a publish-subscribe object request broker on top of a POSIX application programming interface. This allows to reuse common Unix knowledge and experience, including a bash-like shell. We demonstrate with a vertical takeoff and landing (VTOL) use case that the system modularity is well suited for novel and experimental vehicle platforms. We also show how the system architecture allows a direct interface to ROS and to run individual processes either as native ROS nodes on Linux or nodes on the micro controller, maximizing interoperability.

Such uncertainties, arising from the loss of precision induced by numerical calculation with limited time or hardware, are important for much contemporary science and industry. Within applications such as climate science and astrophysics, the need to make decisions on the basis of computations with large and complex data have led to a renewed focus on the management of numerical uncertainty. We describe how several seminal classic numerical methods can be interpreted naturally as probabilistic inference. We then show that the probabilistic view suggests new algorithms that can flexibly be adapted to suit application specifics, while delivering improved empirical performance. We provide concrete illustrations of the benefits of probabilistic numeric algorithms on real scientific problems from astrometry and astronomical imaging, while highlighting open problems with these new algorithms. Finally, we describe how probabilistic numerical methods provide a coherent framework for identifying the uncertainty in calculations performed with a combination of numerical algorithms (e.g. both numerical optimizers and differential equation solvers), potentially allowing the diagnosis (and control) of error sources in computations.",,

In response, software-based malware detection tools have grown in complexity, thus making it computationally difficult to use them to protect systems in real-time. Therefore, software detectors are applied selectively and at a low frequency, creating opportunities for malware to remain undetected. In this paper, we propose Malware-Aware Processors (MAP) - processors augmented with an online hardware-based detector to serve as the first line of defense to differentiate malware from legitimate programs. The output of this detector helps the system prioritize how to apply more expensive software-based solutions. The always-on nature of MAP detector helps protect against intermittently operating malware. Our work improves on the state of the art in the following ways: (1) We define and explore the use of sub-semantic features for online detection of malware. (2) We explore hardware implementations and show that simple classifiers appropriate for such implementations can effectively classify malware. We also study different classifiers, develop implementation optimizations, and explore complexity to performance trade-offs. (3) We propose a two-level detection framework where the hardware classifier prioritizes the work of a more accurate but more expensive software defense mechanism. (4) We integrate the MAP implementation with an open-source x86-compatible core, synthesizing the resulting design to run on an FPGA.",,

We envision these APIs to satisfy the networking needs of many programming models such as Message Passing Interface (MPI), OpenSHMEM, Partitioned Global Address Space (PGAS) languages, task-based paradigms and I/O bound applications. To evaluate the design we implement the APIs and protocols, and measure the performance of overhead-critical network primitives fundamental for implementing many parallel programming models and system libraries. Our results show that the latency, bandwidth, and message rate achieved by the portable UCX prototype is very close to that of the underlying driver. With UCX, we achieved a message exchange latency of 0.89 us, a bandwidth of 6138.5 MB/s, and a message rate of 14 million messages per second.

However, printed parts are typically plastic and often perform poorly compared to traditionally machined mechanisms. We have overcome many of the limitations of 3D printed mechanisms by exploiting the compliance of the plastic to produce a monolithic 3D printed flexure translation stage, capable of sub-micron-scale motion over a range of 8 × 8 × 4 mm. This requires minimal post-print clean-up and can be automated with readily available stepper motors. The resulting plastic composite structure is very stiff and exhibits remarkably low drift, moving less than 20 μm over the course of a week, without temperature stabilisation. This enables us to construct a miniature microscope with excellent mechanical stability, perfect for time-lapse measurements in situ in an incubator or fume hood. The ease of manufacture lends itself to use in containment facilities where disposability is advantageous and to experiments requiring many microscopes in parallel. High performance mechanisms based on printed flexures need not be limited to microscopy, and we anticipate their use in other devices both within the laboratory and beyond.",,

Unfortunately, current commercial devices, e.g., sensor nodes and network gateways, tend to be expensive and proprietary, which presents a barrier to entry and arguably slows down further development. There are, however, an increasing number of open embedded platforms available and also a wide selection of off-the-shelf components that can quickly and easily be built into device and network gateway solutions. The question is whether these solutions measure up to built-for-purpose devices. In the paper, we provide a comparison of existing built-for-purpose devices against open source devices.

China’s makers demonstrate that the future of making—if to materialize in the ways currently envisioned by writers, politicians, and scholars of the global tech industry—rests on taking seriously the technological and cultural fabrics of professional making outside familiar information technology innovation hubs like Silicon Valley: making-do, mass production, and reuse. I trace back to China’s first hackerspace, documenting how a collective of makers began to move away from appropriating Western concepts of openness toward promoting China as source for knowledge, creativity, and innovation. This article demonstrates that when China’s makers set up open hardware businesses and articulate a unique culture of “hacking with Chinese characteristics,” they draw boundaries between the professional making they saw embodied in Chinese industrial production and the hobbyist making embodied in Western histories and cultures of hacking. In so doing, they position China as site of both technological and cultural expertise, intervening in dominant conceptions of computing that split manufacturing and innovation along geographical lines.

Many current methods fail to deal with the vast range of outdoor lighting conditions and the speed at which these can change. This confines experiments to artificial environments where conditions must be tightly controlled. Additionally, the emergence of low-cost eye tracking devices calls for the development of analysis tools that enable non-technical researchers to process the output of their images. We have developed a fast and accurate method (known as “SET”) that is suitable even for natural environments with uncontrolled, dynamic and even extreme lighting conditions. We compared the performance of SET with that of two open-source alternatives by processing two collections of eye images: images of natural outdoor scenes with extreme lighting variations (“Natural”); and images of less challenging indoor scenes (“CASIA-Iris-Thousand”). We show that SET excelled in outdoor conditions and was faster, without significant loss of accuracy, indoors. SET offers a low cost eye-tracking solution, delivering high performance even in challenging outdoor environments. It is offered through an open-source MATLAB toolkit as well as a dynamic-link library (“DLL”), which can be imported into many programming languages including C# and Visual Basic in Windows OS (www.eyegoeyetracker.co.uk).",,

In particular, we explore the possibility of using Intel SGX to provide security and privacy in a wide range of network applications. We show that leveraging hardware protection of TEEs opens up new possibilities, often at the benefit of a much simplified application/protocol design. We demonstrate its practical implications by exploring the design space for SGX-enabled software-defined inter-domain routing, peer-to-peer anonymity networks (Tor), and middleboxes.

Tools and software needed to develop and debug trusted applications may be expensive or non-existent. In this paper, we describe Open-TEE, a virtual, hardware-independent TEE implemented in software. Open-TEE conforms to GP specifications. It allows developers to develop and debug trusted applications with the same tools they use for developing software in general.

Aluminum oxide, boron nitride, and titanium nitride coatings were evaluated as possible substrate release agents for aluminum printing. Additionally, the in situ formation of substrate release agents such as intermetallics and oxides were tested for both aluminum and steel printing. Testing was performed with a modified Charpy impact tester to remove 3D printed metal parts from an 1100 aluminum or A36 low carbon steel print substrate to assess the impact energy required for removal. Specimen porosity was measured prior to sectioning and microstructural analysis, hardness traverses were measured across the specimens, and the elastic and shear moduli of the parts were analyzed via ultrasonic methods. All of the employed substrate release mechanisms minimized weld penetration and, in some instances, formed a brittle phase with the print substrate that allowed the specimens to be removed with minimal impact energy.

High performance is obtained through the use of the high-performance BLAS, hardware-specific tuning, and a hybridization methodology whereby we split the algorithm into computational tasks of various granularities. Execution of those tasks is properly scheduled over the heterogeneous hardware by minimizing data movements and mapping algorithmic requirements to the architectural strengths of the various heterogeneous hardware components. Our methodology and programming techniques are incorporated into the MAGMA MIC API, which abstracts the application developer fromthe specifics of the Xeon Phi architecture and is therefore applicable to algorithms beyond the scope of DLA.",,

Turning on all available prefetchers rarely yields the best performance and, in some cases, prefetching even hurts performance. This paper studies the effect of hardware prefetching on multithreaded code and presents a machine-learning technique to predict the optimal combination of prefetchers for a given application. This technique is based on program characterization and utilizes hardware performance events in conjunction with a pruning algorithm to obtain a concise and expressive feature set. The resulting feature set is used in three different learning models. All necessary steps are implemented in a framework that reaches, on average, 96% of the best possible prefetcher speedup.

Due to the complexity of tensegrity structures, modeling through physics simulation and machine learning improves our ability to design and evaluate new structures and their controllers in a dynamic environment. The kinematics of our simulator, the open source NASA Tensegrity Robotics Toolkit, have been previously validated within 1.3% error on position through motion capture of the six strut robot ReCTeR. This paper provides additional validation of the dynamics through the direct comparison of the simulator to forces experienced by the latest version of the Tetraspine robot.

Such a system provides for the use of an electric pump for the circulation of heat transfer fluid connecting the solar thermal panel to the storage tank. The running plant temperatures are the fundamental parameter to evaluate the system performance such as proper operation, and the control and management system has to consider these parameters. A solar energy-powered wireless-based smart object was developed, able to monitor the running temperatures of a solar thermal system and aimed at moving beyond standard monitoring approaches to achieve a low-cost and customizable device, even in terms of installation in different environmental conditions. To this end, two types of communications were used: the first is a low-cost communication based on the ZigBee protocol used for control purposes, so that it can be customized according to specific needs, while the second is based on a Bluetooth protocol used for data display.",,

For this purpose, it is becoming common to employ open-source microcontroller platforms, such as the Arduino. These boards and associated integrated software development environments provide affordable yet powerful solutions for the implementation of hardware control of transducers and acquisition of signals from detectors and sensors. It is, however, a challenge to write programs that allow interactive use of such arrangements from a personal computer. This task is particularly complex if some of the included hardware components are connected directly to the computer and not via the microcontroller. A graphical user interface framework, Instrumentino, was therefore developed to allow the creation of control programs for complex systems with minimal programming effort. By writing a single code file, a powerful custom user interface is generated, which enables the automatic running of elaborate operation sequences and observation of acquired experimental data in real time. The framework, which is written in Python, allows extension by users, and is made available as an open source project.",,

Methods:: By definition, open source hardware is “hardware whose design is made publicly available so that anyone can study, modify, distribute, make, and sell the design or hardware based on that design”. Arduino microcontroller boards and the evolution in 3d printing technologies are among the most successful open hardware examples. These examples showed that both collaboration and competition are factors facilitating and accelerating innovations. They also help universalizing research by decreasing costs and enabling higher‐level manufacturing. Participation in open source projects in academia has also shown to have multiple advantages. The project gets massively peer reviewed through its online publication, and the comments generally lead to improvement of the design and better performance. It also increases the visibility of the work, therefore increasing the chance for citations and funding. Results:: The development in‐house of a motorized detector positioning device that can be mounted to a water tank will be open‐sourced and presented as an example of open source project that could be useful to others in the Medical Physics field, whether it is for research or clinical work. The common aspects to share when open‐sourcing a project will be discussed. A device for regulating the temperature inside a water phantom will also be presented and open‐sourced to the community. Finally, the development of a project‐sharing web platform specially designed for the Medical Physics community will be discussed. Conclusion:: The open source hardware movement is gaining in popularity and the Medical Physics field could benefit from a similar collaborative open‐framework. It would definitely help driving and accelerating innovations in the field as well as decreasing some of the associated costs.",https://api.wiley.com/onlinelibrary/tdm/v1/articles/10.1118%2F1.4923957,

With the advent of technology, expansion of telephone network, and lowering of tariff, there has been expansion of e-learning services, web based education, and mobile learning. Currently there are around 600 conventional (face-to-face) universities in India serving around 1.2 billion students. Starting with one Open University in 1982, now we have 15 open universities. There are single mode and dual mode distance education institutions. These provide instructions from print based to technology enabled means. All these developments transformed the teaching learning. Many of the institutions followed Open Educational Resources and Open Source movement. Reasons are varied for adopting open source. With the purpose to reduce the costs on software development, freedom to improve the software and freedom to redistribute to help neighbours has made individuals, institutions, and governments support open source.

As nations increasingly rely on knowledge assets to grow, the adoption of OSS will have profound economic consequences. This paper identifies the mechanisms inherent to OSS production that help fuel innovation in knowledge-based economies. As a collaborative and open production model, OSS is conceptualized as a prototype of open innovation. Drawing on US employment projections for 2008-2018, the authors' analysis predicts OSS will have a positive impact on employment growth in well-paid salary jobs across multiple sectors of the US economy. OSS-related software development jobs are widely diffuse throughout the economy, help build a skilled labour force and offer wages significantly above the national average. OSS is thus believed to be a strong contributor to growth in high-value employment in the US. The authors also posit that, as industries are exposed to the benefits of OSS as a result of the broad diffusion of OSS-related jobs, open innovation processes outside software development may be adopted through a process of learning and imitation.",https://www.igi-global.com/viewtitle.aspx?TitleId=120934,

To address these challenges, businesses can use Open Source Software (OSS). Even though OSS provides many benefits, including high-quality software and substantial profit (Sohn & Mok, 2008), OSS also has a number of disadvantages. In several countries, governments have begun to recognize the importance of OSS and have started to adopt explicit policies on OSS (Cook & Horobin, 2006). Open Source Software holds several compelling benefits for businesses. Information on wide-ranging use and examples of OSS in organizations are scattered and sometimes skewed to a few OSS.

Direct geo-referencing system uses the technology of remote sensing to quickly grasp images, GPS tracks, and camera position. These data allows the construction of large volumes of images with geographic coordinates. So that users can be measured directly on the images. In order to properly calculate positioning, all the sensor signals must be synchronized. Traditional aerial photography use Position and Orientation System (POS) to integrate image, coordinates and camera position. However, it is very expensive. And users could not use the result immediately because the position information does not embed into image. To considerations of economy and efficiency, this study aims to develop a direct geo-referencing system based on open source software and hardware platform. After using Arduino microcontroller board to integrate the signals, we then can calculate positioning with open source software OpenCV. In the end, we use open source panorama browser, panini, and integrate all these to open source GIS software, Quantum GIS.

Manta is optimized for rapid germline and somatic analysis, calling structural variants, medium-sized indels and large insertions on standard compute hardware in less than a tenth of the time that comparable methods require to identify only subsets of these variant types: for example NA12878 at 50× genomic coverage is analyzed in less than 20 min. Manta can discover and score variants based on supporting paired and split-read evidence, with scoring models optimized for germline analysis of diploid individuals and somatic analysis of tumor-normal sample pairs. Call quality is similar to or better than comparable methods, as determined by pedigree consistency of germline calls and comparison of somatic calls to COSMIC database variants. Manta consistently assembles a higher fraction of its calls to base-pair resolution, allowing for improved downstream annotation and analysis of clinical significance.

However, more information has not translated into a greater understanding of disease complexity to satisfy diagnostic and therapeutic needs. Challenges include noncompatible technology platforms, the need for wide‐scale and long‐term deployment of sensor technology (among vulnerable elderly patients in particular), and the gap between the “big data” acquired with sensitive measurement technologies and their limited clinical application. Major opportunities could be realized if new technologies are developed as part of open‐source and/or open‐hardware platforms that enable multichannel data capture sensitive to the broad range of motor and nonmotor problems that characterize PD and are adaptable into self‐adjusting, individualized treatment delivery systems. The International Parkinson and Movement Disorders Society Task Force on Technology is entrusted to convene engineers, clinicians, researchers, and patients to promote the development of integrated measurement and closed‐loop therapeutic systems with high patient adherence that also serve to (1) encourage the adoption of clinico‐pathophysiologic phenotyping and early detection of critical disease milestones, (2) enhance the tailoring of symptomatic therapy, (3) improve subgroup targeting of patients for future testing of disease‐modifying treatments, and (4) identify objective biomarkers to improve the longitudinal tracking of impairments in clinical care and research.

However, it has proved challenging to 3D print PDMS in complex structures due to its low elastic modulus and need for support during the printing process. Here we demonstrate the 3D printing of hydrophobic PDMS prepolymer resins within a hydrophilic Carbopol gel support via freeform reversible embedding (FRE). In the FRE printing process, the Carbopol support acts as a Bingham plastic that yields and fluidizes when the syringe tip of the 3D printer moves through it, but acts as a solid for the PDMS extruded within it. This, in combination with the immiscibility of hydrophobic PDMS in the hydrophilic Carbopol, confines the PDMS prepolymer within the support for curing times up to 72 h while maintaining dimensional stability. After printing and curing, the Carbopol support gel releases the embedded PDMS prints by using phosphate buffered saline solution to reduce the Carbopol yield stress. As proof-of-concept, we used Sylgard 184 PDMS to 3D print linear and helical filaments via continuous extrusion and cylindrical and helical tubes via layer-by-layer fabrication. Importantly, we show that the 3D printed tubes were manifold and perfusable. The results demonstrate that hydrophobic polymers with low viscosity and long cure times can be 3D printed using a hydrophilic support, expanding the range of biomaterials that can be used in additive manufacturing. Further, by implementing the technology using low cost open-source hardware and software tools, the FRE printing technique can be rapidly implemented for research applications.",,

Although promising, each base station needs accurate estimation of the channel state information (CSI), either through feedback or channel reciprocity schemes in order to achieve the benefits of massive MIMO in practice. Time division duplex (TDD) has been suggested as a better mode to acquire timely CSI in massive MIMO systems. The use of non-orthogonal pilot schemes, proposed for channel estimation in multi-cell TDD networks, is considered as a major source of pilot contamination in the literature due to the limitations of coherence time. Given the importance of pilot contamination in massive MIMO systems, we provide an extensive survey on pilot contamination, and identify other possible sources of pilot contamination, which include hardware impairment and non-reciprocal transceivers. We review established theories that have analyzed the effect of pilot contamination on the performance of massive MIMO systems, particularly on achievable rates. Next, we categorize the different proposed mitigation techniques for pilot contamination using the following taxonomy: pilot-based approach and subspace-based approach. Finally, we highlight the open issues, such as training overhead, deployment scenario, computational complexity, use of channel reciprocity, and conclude with broader perspective and a look at future trends in pilot contamination in massive MIMO systems.",,

Training a deep network is usually a very time-consuming process. To address the huge computational challenge in deep learning, many tools exploit hardware features such as multi-core CPUs and many-core GPUs to shorten the training and inference time. However, different tools exhibit different features and running performance when they train different types of deep networks on different hardware platforms, making it difficult for end users to select an appropriate pair of software and hardware. In this paper, we present our attempt to benchmark several state-of-the-art GPU-accelerated deep learning software tools, including Caffe, CNTK, TensorFlow, and Torch. We focus on evaluating the running time performance (i.e., speed) of these tools with three popular types of neural networks on two representative CPU platforms and three representative GPU platforms. Our contribution is two-fold. First, for end users of deep learning software tools, our benchmarking results can serve as a reference to selecting appropriate hardware platforms and software tools.

At runtime, a 2.5D pointcloud captured from a single point of view is fed into the CNN, which fills in the occluded regions of the scene, allowing grasps to be planned and executed on the completed object. Runtime shape completion is very rapid because most of the computational costs of shape completion are borne during offline training. We explore how the quality of completions vary based on several factors. These include whether or not the object being completed existed in the training data and how many object models were used to train the network. We also look at the ability of the network to generalize to novel objects allowing the system to complete previously unseen objects at runtime. Finally, experimentation is done both in simulation and on actual robotic hardware to explore the relationship between completion quality and the utility of the completed mesh model for grasping.",,

By interspersing short periods of closed-chamber oxygen consumption measurements with regular flush periods, accurate oxygen uptake rate measurements can be made without the accumulation of waste products, particularly carbon dioxide, which may confound results. Automating the procedure with easily available hardware and software further reduces error by allowing many measurements to be made over long periods thereby minimizing animal stress due to acclimation issues. This paper describes some of the fundamental principles that need to be considered when designing and carrying out automated intermittent-flow respirometry (e.g. chamber size, flush rate, flush time, chamber mixing, measurement periods and temperature control).

Currently, the application of these approaches is severely limited by the availability of appropriate instrumentation and by the ability to communicate experimental protocols, results and analyses. To address these issues, we have developed a low-cost, yet sophisticated open-source scientific instrument designed to enable communities of researchers, plant breeders, educators, farmers and citizen scientists to collect high-quality field data on a large scale. The MultispeQ provides measurements in the field or laboratory of both, environmental conditions (light intensity and quality, temperature, humidity, CO2 levels, time and location) and useful plant phenotypes, including photosynthetic parameters-photosystem II quantum yield (FII), non-photochemical exciton quenching (NPQ), photosystem II photoinhibition, light-driven proton translocation and thylakoid proton motive force, regulation of the chloroplast ATP synthase and potentially many others-and leaf chlorophyll and other pigments. Plant phenotype data are transmitted from the MultispeQ to mobile devices, laptops or desktop computers together with key metadata that gets saved to the PhotosynQ platform (https://photosynq.org) and provides a suite of web-based tools for sharing, visualization, filtering, dissemination and analyses. We present validation experiments, comparing MultispeQ results with established platforms, and show that it can be usefully deployed in both laboratory and field settings. We present evidence that MultispeQ can be used by communities of researchers to rapidly measure, store and analyse multiple environmental and plant properties, allowing for deeper understanding of the complex interactions between plants and their environment.",,

Middleboxes have been deployed widely to complement the basic end-to-end functionality provided by the Internet Protocol suite that depends only on the minimal functionality of a best-effort network layer. The move from purpose-built hardware middleboxes to software appliances running in virtual machines provides much needed deployment flexibility, but significant challenges remain. Just as Software Defined Networking (SDN) research and product development was greatly accelerated with the release of several open source SDN platforms, we believe that Network Function Virtualization (NFV) research can see similar growth with the development of a flexible platform that enables high performance NFV prototypes. Towards this end we have been building OpenNetVM, an efficient packet processing framework that greatly simplifies the development of network functions, as well as research into their management and optimization. OpenNetVM runs network functions in lightweight Docker containers, enabling fast startup and reducing memory overheads. The OpenNetVM platform manager provides load balancing, flexible flow management, and service name abstractions. OpenNetVM efficiently routes packets through dynamically created service chains, achieving throughputs of 10 Gbps even when traversing a chain of 6 NFs.

With the size of data sets grows exponentially, the energy demand for training such data sets increases rapidly. It is highly desirable to design deep learning frameworks and algorithms that are both accurate and energy efficient.

As a result, cloud service providers are expected to host an increasing number of microservices that can generate significant resource pressure on the cloud infrastructure. We want to understand the characteristics of microservice workloads to design an infrastructure optimized for microservices. In this paper, we used Acme Air, an open-source benchmark for Web services, and analyzed the behavior of two versions of the benchmark, microservice and monolithic, for two widely used language runtimes, Node.js and Java. We observed a significant overhead due to the microservice architecture; the performance of the microservice version can be 79.2% lower than the monolithic version on the same hardware configuration. On Node.js, the microservice version consumed 4.22 times more time in the libraries of Node.js than the monolithic version to process one user request. On Java, the microservice version also consumed more time in the application server than the monolithic version. We explain these performance differences from both hardware and software perspectives. We discuss the network virtualization in Docker, an infrastructure for microservices that has nonnegligible impact on performance. These findings give clues to develop optimization techniques in a language runtime and hardware for microservice workloads.",,

Such database performance engineering is hard: a plethora of data and hardware-dependent optimization techniques form a design space that is difficult to navigate for a skilled engineer --- even more so for a query compiler. To facilitate performance-oriented design exploration and query plan compilation, we present Voodoo, a declarative intermediate algebra that abstracts the detailed architectural properties of the hardware, such as multi- or many-core architectures, caches and SIMD registers, without losing the ability to generate highly tuned code. Because it consists of a collection of declarative, vector-oriented operations, Voodoo is easier to reason about and tune than low-level C and related hardware-focused extensions (Intrinsics, OpenCL, CUDA, etc.). This enables our Voodoo compiler to produce (OpenCL) code that rivals and even outperforms the fastest state-of-the-art in memory databases for both GPUs and CPUs. In addition, Voodoo makes it possible to express techniques as diverse as cache-conscious processing, predication and vectorization (again on both GPUs and CPUs) with just a few lines of code. Central to our approach is a novel idea we termed control vectors, which allows a code generating frontend to expose parallelism to the Voodoo compiler in a abstract manner, enabling portable performance across hardware platforms.    We used Voodoo to build an alternative backend for MonetDB, a popular open-source in-memory database. Our backend allows MonetDB to perform at the same level as highly tuned in-memory databases, including HyPeR and Ocelot. We also demonstrate Voodoo's usefulness when investigating hardware conscious tuning techniques, assessing their performance on different queries, devices and data.",,

This could avoid large string of PV modules and helps in reducing the voltage rating of the capacitors and semiconductor devices used in the system. This may further help in reduction of cost of the system. The proposed single-stage system is operated using an integrated control algorithm, which includes the maximum power point tracking (MPPT), the V/f control, and the sample-averaged zero-sequence elimination (SAZE) pulsewidth modulation (PWM) technique. While the MPPT algorithm ensures the extraction of maximum power from the PV source, the V/f control improves the motor pump performance. Furthermore, the zero-sequence current is avoided by the SAZE PWM algorithm. Thus, the integrated control algorithm improves the overall performance of the system.

To address this problem, we develop an open source platform, called OpenSGX, that emulates Intel SGX hardware components at the instruction level and provides new system software components necessarily required for full TEE exploration. We expect that the OpenSGX framework can serve as an open platform for SGX research, with the following contributions. First, we develop a fully functional, instruction-compatible emulator of Intel SGX for enabling the exploration of software/hardware design space, and development of enclave programs. OpenSGX provides a platform for SGX development, meaning that it provides not just emulation but also operating system components, an enclave program loader/packager, an OpenSGX user library, debugging, and performance monitoring. Second, to show OpenSGX’s use cases, we applied OpenSGX to protect sensitive information (e.g., directory) of Tor nodes and evaluated their potential performance impacts.

In response, software-based malware detection tools have grown in complexity, thus making it computationally difficult to use them to protect systems in real-time. Therefore, software detectors are applied selectively and at a low frequency, creating opportunities for malware to remain undetected. In this paper, we propose Malware-Aware Processors (MAP) - processors augmented with a hardware-based online malware detector to serve as the first line of defense to differentiate malware from legitimate programs. The output of this detector helps the system prioritize how to apply more expensive software-based solutions. The always-on nature of MAP detector helps protect against intermittently operating malware. We explore the use of different features for classification and study both logistic regression and neural networks. We show that the detectors can achieve excellent performance, with little hardware overhead. We integrate the MAP implementation with an open-source x86-compatible core, synthesizing the resulting design to run on an FPGA.",,

Such firm strategies are now common for open source software and other information goods. However, they pose conceptual and practical uncertainties for hardware-focused companies, particularly as research on open hardware has emphasized community rather than firm success. Here we study firm openness in 3D printing, with a case study of how MakerBot Industries leveraged external communities and selective openness become the consumer market leader. After reviewing the literature on systemic innovation and selective openness, we document the proprietary strategies of a dozen startup companies during the first two decades of the 3D printing industry. We contrast this to the open hardware, software and content strategy that MakerBot's founders used to enter and grow the consumer market from 2009 onward. We show how MakerBot shifted to a selectively open, systemic innovation strategy that complemented proprietary hardware and software with open user-generated content from its Thingiverse online community. From this, we suggest the inherent complementarity of selective openness strategies between open and proprietary components, and conclude with predictions as to when and how a startup or incumbent firm will combine open and proprietary elements.

Although many expect 3-D printing to take off at the household level and previous work has shown significant returns for those choosing to do so, there are still significant barriers to entry for typical consumers. Our analysis demonstrates that for an individual to make an abnormally high return on their investments in 3-D printers, they must serve others to achieve high utilization rates. The impetus to do so is created by a service that can undercut traditionally manufactured products due to affordability and customizability.

Internally, the design of OpenARC uses a high-level intermediate representation that separates concerns of program representation from underlying architectures, which facilitates portability of OpenARC. In fact, this design allowed us to create the OpenACC-to-FPGA translation framework with minimal extensions to our existing system.

MCMs are defined at the various layers of the hardware-software stack, requiring thoroughly verified specifications, compilers, and implementations at the interfaces between layers. Current verification techniques evaluate segments of the system stack in isolation, such as proving compiler mappings from a high-level language (HLL) to an ISA or proving validity of a microarchitectural implementation of an ISA. This paper makes a case for full-stack MCM verification and provides a toolflow, TriCheck, capable of verifying that the HLL, compiler, ISA, and implementation collectively uphold MCM requirements. The work showcases TriCheck's ability to evaluate a proposed ISA MCM in order to ensure that each layer and each mapping is correct and complete. Specifically, we apply TriCheck to the open source RISC-V ISA [55], seeking to verify accurate, efficient, and legal compilations from C11. We uncover under-specifications and potential inefficiencies in the current RISC-V ISA documentation and identify possible solutions for each. As an example, we find that a RISC-V-compliant microarchitecture allows 144 outcomes forbidden by C11 to be observed out of 1,701 litmus tests examined. Overall, this paper demonstrates the necessity of full-stack verification for detecting MCM-related bugs in the hardware-software stack.",,

It has been noted that the nonlinear dynamics of DWs in the physical magnetic system is an untapped source of entropy that can be leveraged for hardware security. The inherent noise, spatial, and temporal randomness in the magnetic system can be employed in conjunction with microscopic and macroscopic properties to realize novel hardware security primitives. Due to simplicity of integration, the spintronic circuits can be an add-on to the silicon substrate to complement the existing CMOS-based security and trust infrastructures.

State-of-the-Art Computer Architecture research at Indian Academic Institutions is majorly restricted due to unavailability of processor design models that are close to current commercially available cores. The SHAKTI processor initiative aims at breaking this barrier between Academia and Industry by providing open-source Processor and SoC designs. With the advent of RISC-V ISA by UC Berkeley, we have a simple, clean and most importantly an open source ISA that can be used to design processors which have the potential to match the current day processors in the market. The initiative is also driven to provide substantial information about design decisions and promote more competitive learning environment in academia. The processors from SHAKTI will help in aiding research related to architecture, where one can run simulations on the actual hardware and obtain much accurate results, rather than settling with a lesser accurate software simulation. Since these processors and designs are targeted for real-world use, they can also be freely adopted by industries, thereby supporting the initiative further in terms of product-driven research.In this workshop we plan to talk about the various designs that we are working on and how they can be used. The proposed tutorial consists of four parts. The first part emphasizes on the need for open-source hardware design and the rationale behind our choices of ISA and HDL. The second part covers about our microcontroller class (C-class) core and the verification and debug environment. The third part presents our flagship processor which is the industrial class (I-class) core; the various design decisions involved and some performance metrics. The final part concludes on the note of future work and upcoming releases under SHAKTI.",,

Along with cloud computing, NFV and SDN are moving network functions from dedicated hardware to software implementation (Virtual Network Functions - VNF), on Virtual Machine (VM) or other virtualization technology such as containers, on top of a virtualized platform in the Cloud. To connect the VNFs, hosted in the same Data Center (DC) or across multiple DCs, virtual switches are required. Besides forwarding functions, virtual switches can be configured to mirror traffics for network management needs. Among the existing virtual switch solutions, Open vSwitch (OVS) is the most known and used. OVS is open source, and included in most of the existing Linux distributions. However, OVS performance in terms of throughput for smaller packets is very smaller than of line rate of the interface. To overcome this limitation, OVS was ported to Data Plane Development Kit (DPDK), namely OVDK. The latter achieves an impressive line rate throughput across physical interfaces. In this paper, we present the result of OVDK performance test when flow and port mirroring are activated, which was not tested so far. The performance test focuses on two parameters, throughput and latency in OVDK; allowing to validate the use of OVDK for flow forwarding and network management in the envisioned virtualized network architecture.",,

Optimized sparse linear algebra libraries are thus needed so that users can build applications without enormous effort. Hardware vendors release proprietary libraries that are highly optimized for their devices, but they limit interoperability and promote vendor lock-in. Open libraries often work across multiple devices and can quickly take advantage of new innovations, but they may not reach peak performance.

This approach has the potential to dramatically change many fields of study including that of microscope use in research settings.

The efficient use of irrigation water is a key factor in coping with the food demands of an increasing world population and with the negative effects of climate change on water resource availability in many areas. In this complex context, it is important that farmers can rely on instruments and practices that enable a better management of water at the field scale, whatever the irrigation method they adopt. In this paper, we present an open-hardware device based on the Arduino technology that was developed to allow the continuous monitoring of soil water potential in the root zone for supporting irrigation scheduling at the field scale. The structure of the device is flexible and can be adapted to host different types of sensors. The results, obtained managing irrigation in a peach orchard, show that adoption of the device, together with a simple irrigation scheduling criterion, allowed a significant increase of water use efficiency without causing a reduction of the quantity and quality of crop production.

The signal goes first through an instrumentation amplifier, INA155, which is suitable for low amplitude signals like the seismic noise, and an anti-aliasing filter based on the MAX7404 switched-capacitor filter. After that, the amplified and filtered signal is digitized and processed by Arduino Due and registered in an SD memory card. Geophonino is configured for continuous registering, where the sampling frequency, the amplitude gain and the registering time are user-defined. The complete prototype is an open source and open hardware system. It has been tested by comparing the registered signals with the ones obtained through different commercial data recording systems and different kind of geophones. The obtained results show good correlation between the tested measurements, presenting Geophonino as a low-cost alternative system for seismic data recording. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

This program was developed in a senior class at the high school Liceo Paschini in Tolmezzo (northeast Italy). The students under the supervision of their physics teacher and seismologists, used an Arduino board, ADXL345 accelerometers, and open-source software to create a low-cost seismometer able to record local strong motion. In this article, we provide a ""how-to"" (instructional) guide to enable other students to reproduce the experiment. Certain introductory lessons in computer sciences and electronics were required for the students to acquire the necessary skills and to fill gaps in their background knowledge. In addition, lectures by seismologists and specific laboratory activities allowed the class to explore different aspects of the physics of earthquakes, particularly of the seismic waves, and to become familiar with seismic-hazard topics through inquiry-based learning. We believe that this exercise is a good example of how earthquake issues can be taught through a multidisciplinary approach in subjects traditionally covered by scientific and technological disciplines.",,

The dependability of the Internet of Things is critical because the services will be concerned with real life. However, the inexpensive hardware provides limited resources for communication. In this paper, we present exact all-terminal reliability of the wireless networks of which the number of links of each node is bounded. First, we analyze the all-terminal reliability of the regular wireless network, where any two nodes are connected by a wireless link consisting of a pair of radio modules. The reliability polynomial is derived from the Tutte polynomial that is the seminal work of the algebraic graph theory. Second, we analyze the all-terminal reliability of the wireless network including the random mesh network under the assumption that if the module fails, all radio links connected through a radio module are cut off. We consider both the fault of the communication module and the fading of the wireless channel in the indoor channel condition. For improving the reliability, we also propose a fault-tolerant method giving redundant radio modules into each node. We also analyze cost-effectiveness. We also calculate the mean-time-to-failure (MTTF) for wireless networks. We show that the random mesh network of which each node includes three or more the radio-broadcast modules is more dependable than any other regular network of which each node comprises four point-to-point modules if it is the connected graph in the static environment.",,

Despite technological advances and a need for methodological improvements, chromogenic and fluorogenic enzymatic techniques remain the mainstays of water quality monitoring for both public health agencies and regulated utilities. We demonstrated that bioelectroanalytical approaches to FIB enumeration are possible and can be achieved using commercially available enzyme-specific resorufin glycosides, although these are expensive, not widely available or designed for purpose. Following this, we designed two naphthoquinone glycosides which performed better, achieving Escherichia coli detection in the range 5.0x10(2) to 5.0x10(5) CFUml(-1) 22-54% quicker than commercially available resorufin glycosides. The molecular design of the naphthoquinone glycosides requires fewer synthetic steps allowing them to be produced for as little as US$50 per kg. Tests with environmental samples demonstrated the low tendency for abiotic interference and that, despite specificity being maintained between -glucuronidase and -galactosidase, accurate enumeration of E.coli in environmental samples necessitates development of a selective medium. In comparison to a commercially available detection method, which has U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) approval, our approach performed better at high organism concentrations, detecting 500 organisms in 9h compared with 13.5h for the commercial method. Bioelectroanalytical detection is comparable to current approved methods and with further development could result in improved detection times. A recent trend for low-cost open-source hardware means that automated, potentiostatically controlled E.coli detection systems could be constructed for less than US$100 per channel.",,

The building of this ecosystem relies largely on practices associated with being open-source. Like in California, open innovation contributed to the creation of resources for the development of a vast high-tech industry. This ethnographic field study shows how, while both communities, the international makers and the shanzhai, draw on open innovation, they do not have the same values.

For the makers, open innovation does not entirely eliminate the classic tension between ‘open’ and ‘closed’ commons in the world of makers. These two communities still rarely collaborate.",,

Design/methodology/approach - This paper presents the design of our soccer robots, participating in RoboCup MSL. The mechanical platform, electrical architecture and software framework are discussed separately. The mechanical platform is designed modularly, so easy maintainability is achieved; the electronic architecture is built on industrial standards using PC-based control technique, which results in high robustness and reliability during the intensive and fierce MSL games; the software is developed upon the open-source Robot Operating System (ROS); thus, the advantages of ROS such as modularity, portability and expansibility are inherited. Findings - Based on this paper and the open-source hardware and software, the MSL robots can be re-developed easily to participate in the RoboCup MSL. The robots can also be used in other research and education fields, especially for multi-robot systems and distributed artificial intelligence.

But, students or beginners who have no experience and knowledge of electronic engineering or programming languages still feel a considerable barrier to use Arduino. This study analyzes the barrier of beginners in using the open source hardware. In order to resolve the difficulty in firmware programming, we adopt a functional concise script composed of simplified service commands and minimum options to use the open hardware and proposes a new script-based open source hardware programming environment. From the comparison result with previous development toolkit, we confirm that the programming by the proposed script-based simple programming toolkit is substantially simple by adopting simple script and automatic generations of irrelevant instructions, type declarations and semicolons in programming the open source hardware of Arduino.",,

The superior-inferior movement required to simulate tumour motion during a normal breathing cycle was achieved via the novel use of an Arduino Uno (TM), a low-cost open-source microcontroller board connected to a high torque servo motor. Slow CT imaging was used to acquire the image set and a 4D cone beam CT (4D-CBCT) verified the efficacy of contoured margins before treatment on the moving phantom. Treatment fields were delivered to a section of a CIRS (TM) anthropomorphic phantom. Dose verification to the dynamic phantom with Gafchromic EBT3 film using 3 %-1 mm gamma analysis acceptance criteria registered an absolute dose pass rate for IMRT and VMAT of 98 and 96.6 %, respectively. It was verified that 100 % of the PTV received the prescribed dose of 12 Gy per fraction using the dynamic phantom, and no major discrepancy between planned and measured results due to interplay between multileaf collimator sequences and target motion was observed. This study confirmed that the use of an in-house solution using open source hardware and software with existing quality assurance equipment was appropriate in validating a new treatment technique.",,

However, at present, developing and studying algorithms for these problems can be difficult due to the prohibitive amount of domain knowledge required in both the area of chemistry and quantum algorithms. To help bridge this gap and open the field to more researchers, we have developed the OpenFermion software package (www.openfermion.org). OpenFermion is an open-source software library written largely in Python under an Apache 2.0 license, aimed at enabling the simulation of fermionic and bosonic models and quantum chemistry problems on quantum hardware. Beginning with an interface to common electronic structure packages, it simplifies the translation between a molecular specification and a quantum circuit for solving or studying the electronic structure problem on a quantum computer, minimizing the amount of domain expertise required to enter the field. The package is designed to be extensible and robust, maintaining high software standards in documentation and testing. This release paper outlines the key motivations behind design choices in OpenFermion and discusses some basic OpenFermion functionality which we believe will aid the community in the development of better quantum algorithms and tools for this exciting area of research.",,

Closed-loop experiments, in which causal interventions are conditioned on the state of the system under investigation, have become increasingly common in neuroscience. Such experiments can have a high degree of explanatory power, but they require a precise implementation that can be difficult to replicate across laboratories. We sought to overcome this limitation by building open-source software that makes it easier to develop and share algorithms for closed-loop control. Approach. We created the Open Ephys GUI, an open-source platform for multichannel electrophysiology experiments. In addition to the standard ‘open-loop’ visualization and recording functionality, the GUI also includes modules for delivering feedback in response to events detected in the incoming data stream. Importantly, these modules can be built and shared as plugins, which makes it possible for users to extend the functionality of the GUI through a simple API, without having to understand the inner workings of the entire application. Main results. In combination with low-cost, open-source hardware for amplifying and digitizing neural signals, the GUI has been used for closed-loop experiments that perturb the hippocampal theta rhythm in a phase-specific manner. Significance. The Open Ephys GUI is the first widely used application for multichannel electrophysiology that leverages a plugin-based workflow. We hope that it will lower the barrier to entry for electrophysiologists who wish to incorporate real-time feedback into their research.",,

Recent research convincingly demonstrated, however, that SGX's strengthened adversary model also gives rise to to a new class of powerful, low-noise side-channel attacks leveraging first-rate control over hardware. These attacks commonly rely on frequent enclave preemptions to obtain fine-grained side-channel observations. A maximal temporal resolution is achieved when the victim state is measured after every instruction. Current state-of-the-art enclave execution control schemes, however, do not generally achieve such instruction-level granularity. This paper presents SGX-Step, an open-source Linux kernel framework that allows an untrusted host process to configure APIC timer interrupts and track page table entries directly from user space. We contribute and evaluate an improved approach to single-step enclaved execution at instruction-level granularity, and we show how SGX-Step enables several new or improved attacks.

Consequently, data and techniques have been difficult to reproduce across models and laboratories, analysis is time consuming, and only specialist researchers can quantify data. Objective: Here, we describe and validate an automated, open-source software tool (MUSCLEMOTION) adaptable for use with standard laboratory and clinical imaging equipment that enables quantitative analysis of normal cardiac contraction, disease phenotypes, and pharmacological responses. Methods and Results: MUSCLEMOTION allowed rapid and easy measurement of movement from high-speed movies in (1) 1-dimensional in vitro models, such as isolated adult and human pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes; (2) 2-dimensional in vitro models, such as beating cardiomyocyte monolayers or small clusters of human pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes; (3) 3-dimensional multicellular in vitro or in vivo contractile tissues, such as cardiac “organoids,” engineered heart tissues, and zebrafish and human hearts. MUSCLEMOTION was effective under different recording conditions (bright-field microscopy with simultaneous patch-clamp recording, phase contrast microscopy, and traction force microscopy). Outcomes were virtually identical to the current gold standards for contraction measurement, such as optical flow, post deflection, edge-detection systems, or manual analyses. Finally, we used the algorithm to quantify contraction in in vitro and in vivo arrhythmia models and to measure pharmacological responses. Conclusions: Using a single open-source method for processing video recordings, we obtained reliable pharmacological data and measures of cardiac disease phenotype in experimental cell, animal, and human models.",,

We support this claim by (1) evaluating the degree with which Chisel, an existing HCL, can support powerfully parameterized libraries, and (2) introducing the concept and implementation of an HCF that uses an open-source hardware intermediate representation, FIRRTL (Flexible Intermediate Representation for RTL), to transform target-independent RTL into technology-specific RTL. Finally, we evaluate many hardware compiler transformations, including simplifying transformations, analyses, optimizations, instrumentations, and specializations, which demonstrate the power of a combined HCL and HCF approach.",,

In this paper, we introduce the notion of self-regulating streaming systems and the key properties that they must satisfy. We then present the design and evaluation of Dhalion, a system that provides self-regulation capabilities to underlying streaming systems. We describe our implementation of the Dhalion framework on top of Twitter Heron, as well as a number of policies that automatically reconfigure Heron topologies to meet throughput SLOs, scaling resource consumption up and down as needed.

A serverless application is a set of stateless functions, along with the events that should trigger their activation. A serverless runtime allocates resources as events arrive, avoiding the need for costly pre-allocated or dedicated hardware. While an attractive economic proposition, serverless computing currently lags behind the state of the art when it comes to function composition. This paper addresses the challenge of programming a composition of functions, where the composition is itself a serverless function. We demonstrate that engineering function composition into a serverless application is possible, but requires a careful evaluation of trade-offs. To help in evaluating these trade-offs, we identify three competing constraints: functions should be considered as black boxes; function composition should obey a substitution principle with respect to synchronous invocation; and invocations should not be double-billed. Furthermore, we argue that, if the serverless runtime is limited to a reactive core, i.e. one that deals only with dispatching functions in response to events, then these constraints form the serverless trilemma. Without specific runtime support, compositions-as-functions must violate at least one of the three constraints. Finally, we demonstrate an extension to the reactive core of an open-source serverless runtime that enables the sequential composition of functions in a trilemma-satisfying way. We conjecture that this technique could be generalized to support other combinations of functions.",,

Unfortunately, as DRAM scales down to smaller technology nodes, it faces key challenges in both data integrity and latency, which strongly affects overall system reliability and performance. To develop reliable and high-performance DRAM-based main memory in future systems, it is critical to characterize, understand, and analyze various aspects (e.g., reliability, latency) of existing DRAM chips. To enable this, there is a strong need for a publicly-available DRAM testing infrastructure that can flexibly and efficiently test DRAM chips in a manner accessible to both software and hardware developers. This paper develops the first such infrastructure, SoftMC (Soft Memory Controller), an FPGA-based testing platform that can control and test memory modules designed for the commonly-used DDR (Double Data Rate) interface. SoftMC has two key properties: (i) it provides flexibility to thoroughly control memory behavior or to implement a wide range of mechanisms using DDR commands, and (ii) it is easy to use as it provides a simple and intuitive high-level programming interface for users, completely hiding the low-level details of the FPGA. We demonstrate the capability, flexibility, and programming ease of SoftMC with two example use cases. First, we implement a test that characterizes the retention time of DRAM cells. Experimental results we obtain using SoftMC are consistent with the findings of prior studies on retention time in modern DRAM, which serves as a validation of our infrastructure. Second, we validate two recently-proposed mechanisms, which rely on accessing recently-refreshed or recently-accessed DRAM cells faster than other DRAM cells. Using our infrastructure, we show that the expected latency reduction effect of these mechanisms is not observable in existing DRAM chips, which demonstrates the usefulness of SoftMC in testing new ideas on existing memory modules. We discuss several other use cases of SoftMC, including the ability to characterize emerging non-volatile memory modules that obey the DDR standard. We hope that our open-source release of SoftMC fills a gap in the space of publicly-available experimental memory testing infrastructures and inspires new studies, ideas, and methodologies in memory system design.",,

Advances in three-dimensional (3-D) printing have enabled researchers to quickly customize mechanisms for specific tasks, but the end product is usually not intended for extended use. It would be beneficial to identify strategies to augment the capabilities of additive manufacturing techniques to allow the easy and inexpensive construction of durable and functional hardware.

Data from the device are processed remotely on a workstation or via a cloud application (based on CyVerse). In this paper, we present a proof-of-concept validation experiment on top-view images of 24 Arabidopsis plants in a combination of genotypes that has not been compared previously.

We provide an example configuration costing £167 (£83 excluding suggested memory card and battery), which records audible sound continuously for c. 40 days. We also provide a video tutorial showing hardware assembly and documentation is available via a supporting website. The Solo recorder has been extensively field tested in temperate and tropical regions, with over 50 000 h of audio collected to date. This highly customizable and inexpensive system could greatly increase the scale and ease of conducting bioacoustic studies.",,

In part due to these cost savings, the manufacturing of scientific equipment is beginning to move away from a central paradigm of purchasing proprietary equipment to one in which scientists themselves download open-source designs, fabricate components with digital manufacturing technology, and then assemble the equipment themselves. This trend introduces a need for new formal design procedures that designers can follow when targeting this scientific audience. This study provides five steps in the procedure, encompassing six design principles for the development of free and open-source hardware for scientific applications. A case study is provided for an open-source slide dryer that can be easily fabricated for under $20, which is more than 300 times less than some commercial alternatives. The bespoke design is parametric and easily adjusted for many applications. By designing using open-source principles and the proposed procedures, the outcome will be customizable, under control of the researcher, less expensive than commercial options, more maintainable, and will have many applications that benefit the user since the design documentation is open and freely accessible.",,

Specifically, this article provides three main novel contributions. First, what to our knowledge is the first hardware prototype that manages in a practical real-world scenario the price values obtained from a public electricity operator is presented. The second contribution is related to the definition of a novel wireless sensor network communications protocol based on Wi-Fi that allows for creating an easy-to-deploy smart plug system that self-organizes and auto-configures to collect the sensed data, minimizing user intervention. Third, it is provided a thorough description of the design of one of the few open-source smart plug systems, including its communications architecture, the protocols implemented, the main sensing and actuation components and the most relevant pieces of the software. Moreover, with the aim of illustrating the capabilities of the smart plug system, the results of different experiments performed are shown. Such experiments evaluate in real-world scenarios the system’s ease of use, its communications range and its performance when using HTTPS.

To this end, we review existing solutions, and introduce open storm—an open-source, end-to-end platform for real-time monitoring and control of watersheds. Open storm includes (i) a robust hardware stack for distributed sensing and control in harsh environments (ii) a cloud services platform that enables system-level supervision and coordination of water assets, and (iii) a comprehensive, web-based “how-to” guide, available on open-storm.org, that empowers newcomers to develop and deploy their own smart water networks. We illustrate the capabilities of the open storm platform through two ongoing deployments: (i) a high-resolution flash-flood monitoring network that detects and communicates flood hazards at the level of individual roadways and (ii) a real-time stormwater control network that actively modulates discharges from stormwater facilities to improve water quality and reduce stream erosion.

This device allows imaging in scales ranging from single colonies to entire plates. We developed a set of genetic components (e.g. promoters, coding sequences, terminators) and vectors following the standard framework of Golden Gate, which allowed the fabrication of genetic constructs in a combinatorial, low cost and robust manner. In order to provide simultaneous imaging of multiple wavelength signals, we screened a series of long stokes shift fluorescent proteins that could be combined with cyan/green fluorescent proteins. We found CyOFP1, mBeRFP and sfGFP to be the most compatible set for 3-channel fluorescent imaging. We developed open source Python code to operate the hardware to run time-lapse experiments with automated control of illumination and camera and a Python module to analyze data and extract meaningful biological information. To demonstrate the potential application of this integral system, we tested its performance on a diverse range of imaging assays often used in disciplines such as microbial ecology, microbiology and synthetic biology.

The hardware is built on a solderless breadboard and mainly composed of an Arduino Nano microcontroller, a 16-bit analog-to-digital converter, two electronic buffer amplifiers, a temperature sensor, and a Bluetooth module with a total cost around $50 (US dollars, including a portable power supply ∼$10). The software is written in Arduino Sketch and the cross-platform Python language, both of which the students can access and modify freely. The instrument was demonstrated with a traditional glass electrode and a custom palladium/palladium oxide pH sensing electrode, and compared with a commercial pH meter. Results sho...",,

A slurry doser was designed to replace the plastic extruder of an open-source Prusa i3 printer. The optimal parameters for 3D printing of layers were studied, and the planar chromatographic separations on these printed layers were successfully demonstrated with a mixture of dyes. The layer printing process was fast. For printing a 0.2 mm layer on a 10 cm × 10 cm format, it took less than 5 min. It was affordable, i.e., the running costs for producing such a plate were less than 0.25 Euro and the investment costs for the modified hardware were 630 Euro. This approach demonstrated not only the potential of the 3D printing environment in planar chromatography but also opened new avenues and new perspectives for tailor-made plates, not only with regard to layer materials and their combinations (gradient plates) but also with regard to different layer shapes and patterns. As such an example, separations on a printed plane layer were compared with those obtained from a printed channeled layer. For the latter, 40 channels were printed in parallel on a 10 cm × 10 cm format for the separation of 40 samples. For producing such a channeled plate, the running costs were below 0.04 Euro and the printing process took only 2 min. All modifications of the device and software were released open-source to encourage reuse and improvements and to stimulate the users to contribute to this technology. By this proof-of-principle, another asset was demonstrated to be integrated into the Office Chromatography concept, in which all relevant steps for online miniaturized planar chromatography are performed by a single device.",,

We demonstrate one such spoof detection technique by specially customizing RaspiReader with two cameras for fingerprint image acquisition. One camera provides high contrast, frustrated total internal reflection (FTIR) fingerprint images, and the other outputs direct images of the finger in contact with the platen. Using both of these image streams, we extract complementary information which, when fused together and used for spoof detection, results in marked performance improvement over previous methods relying only on grayscale FTIR images provided by COTS optical readers.

Although a plethora of software for the acquisition of eye-tracking data exists, they often exhibit critical issues when pervasive eye tracking is considered, e.g., closed source, costly eye tracker hardware dependencies, and requiring a human supervisor for calibration. In this paper, we introduce EyeRecToo , an open-source software for real-time pervasive head-mounted eye-tracking. Out of the box, EyeRecToo offers multiple real-time state-of-the-art pupil detection and gaze estimation methods, which can be easily replaced by user implemented algorithms if desired. A novel calibration method that allows users to calibrate the system without the assistance of a human supervisor is also integrated. Moreover, this software supports multiple head-mounted eye-tracking hardware, records eye and scene videos, and stores pupil and gaze information, which are also available as a real-time stream. Thus, EyeRecToo serves as a framework to quickly enable pervasive eye-tracking research and applications. Available at: available-after-proceedings-publication-february-2017",,

Closed-loop experiments provide unique insights into brain dynamics and function. To facilitate a wide range of closed-loop experiments, we created an open-source software platform that enables high-performance real-time processing of streaming experimental data. Approach. We wrote Falcon, a C++ multi-threaded software in which the user can load and execute an arbitrary processing graph. Each node of a Falcon graph is mapped to a single thread and nodes communicate with each other through thread-safe buffers. The framework allows for easy implementation of new processing nodes and data types. Falcon was tested both on a 32-core and a 4-core workstation. Streaming data was read from either a commercial acquisition system (Neuralynx) or the open-source Open Ephys hardware, while closed-loop TTL pulses were generated with a USB module for digital output. We characterized the round-trip latency of our Falcon-based closed-loop system, as well as the specific latency contribution of the software architecture, by testing processing graphs with up to 32 parallel pipelines and eight serial stages. We finally deployed Falcon in a task of real-time detection of population bursts recorded live from the hippocampus of a freely moving rat. Main results. On Neuralynx hardware, round-trip latency was well below 1 ms and stable for at least 1 h, while on Open Ephys hardware latencies were below 15 ms. The latency contribution of the software was below 0.5 ms. Round-trip and software latencies were similar on both 32- and 4-core workstations. Falcon was used successfully to detect population bursts online with ~40 ms average latency. Significance. Falcon is a novel open-source software for closed-loop neuroscience. It has sub-millisecond intrinsic latency and gives the experimenter direct control of CPU resources. We envisage Falcon to be a useful tool to the neuroscientific community for implementing a wide variety of closed-loop experiments, including those requiring use of complex data structures and real-time execution of computationally intensive algorithms, such as population neural decoding/encoding from large cell assemblies.",,

However, to provide high-quality partitioning, this engine must be able to consider a rich design space of possible alternate hardware and software implementations for each program region candidate for hardware acceleration, in turn making the task of finding the optimal mapping very difficult given the number of design points to consider and the need for accurate modeling of latency, power and area. In this work we propose a novel framework to enable hardware acceleration of performance-critical parts of an application, by addressing the problem of hardware/software partitioning under power and area constraints to minimize the overall program latency. Our flow is based on the LLVM compiler, and focuses on building a scalable compile-time partitioning algorithm while considering large sets of alternative hardware and software implementations for a particular region. To this end we develop a hybrid approach based on mixing semi-random selection of hardware design points and an Integer Linear Programming formulation of the mapping decision, along with iterative refinements of the solution. Experimental results demonstrate the capability of our approach to consider complex designs and yet output near-optimal partitioning decision. Our package is named RIP (Randomized ILP-based Partitioning), and is open source to benefit the research community.",,

First, a com-pact, mobile system was built using an infrared gas analyzer combined with open-source hardware to control, georeference, and log measurements of CO2 mixing ratios on ve-hicles (car, bicycles). Second, two measurement campaigns, one in summer and one in winter (heating season) were carried out. Five mobile sensors were deployed within a 1x12.7 km transect across the city of Vancouver, BC, Canada. The sensors were operated for 3.5 h on pre-defined routes to map CO2 mixing ratios at street level, which were then averaged to 100 x 100m grid cells. The averaged CO2 mixing ratios of all grids in the study area were 417.9 ppm in summer and 442.5 ppm in winter. In both campaigns, mixing ratios were highest in the grid cells of the downtown core and along arterial roads and lowest in parks and well vegetated residential areas. Third, an aerodynamic resistance approach to calculating emissions was used to derive CO2 emissions from the gridded CO2 mixing ratio mea-surements in conjunction with mixing ratios and fluxes collected from a 28 m tall eddycovariance tower located within the study area. These measured emissions showed a range of 12 to 226CO(2) ha 1 h 1 in summer and of -14 to 163 kgCO(2) ha 1 h 1 in winter, with an average of 35.1 kgCO(2) ha (-1) h (-1) (summer) and 25.9 kgCO(2) ha 1 h 1 (winter). Fourth, an independent emissions inventory was developed for the study area using buildings energy simulations from a previous study and routinely available traffic counts. The emissions inventory for the same area averaged to 22.06 kgCO(2) ha (-1) h (-1) (summer) and 28.76 kgCO(2) ha (-1) h (-1) (winter) and was used to compare against the measured emissions from the mobile sensor network. The comparison on a grid-by-grid basis showed linearity between CO2 mixing ratios and the emissions inventory (R (2) =53 in summer and R (2) = 47 in winter). Also, 87% (summer) and 94% (winter) of measured grid cells show a difference within +/- 1 order of magnitude, and 49% (summer) and 69% (winter) show an error of less than a factor 2. Although associated with considerable errors at the individual grid cell level, the study demonstrates a promising method of using a network of mobile sensors and an aerody-namic resistance approach to rapidly map greenhouse gases at high spatial resolution across cities. The method could be improved by longer measurements and a refined calculation of the aerodynamic resistance.",,

One way to support stronger end users' engagement with such complex technologies is by involving them in the design process and, with the advent of Arduino prototyping platform, even in their making. While DIY practice offers the potential for stronger user engagement with physical artifacts, we know little about end users' DIY practice of making complex electronic technologies and their potential to ensure engagement with such devices. In this article, we report on interviews with 18 participants from two green communities who built and used an open source DIY energy monitor, with the aim to explore the end users DIY practices of making such complex electronic devices. Findings indicate four key qualities of DIY monitors: transparent modularity, open-endedness, heirloom, and disruptiveness, and how they contribute to more meaningful engagement with the DIY monitors, elevating them from the status of unremarkable objects to that of things. We conclude with three implications for design for supporting end user development of complex electronic DIY: designing transparent open hardware technologies, standardizing communication protocols for the current and future DIY of IoT, and deliberately calling for personal investment and labor in the assembling of DIY kits.",,

Free and open source software and firmware are developed to operate the tool. The OS4PP was validated against a wide range of discrete resistors and indium tin oxide (ITO) samples of different thicknesses both pre- and post-annealing. The OS4PP was then compared to two commercial proprietary systems. Results of resistors from 10 to 1 M show errors of less than 1% for the OS4PP. The 3-D mapping of sheet resistance of ITO samples successfully demonstrated the automated capability to measure non-uniformities in large-area samples. The results indicate that all measured values are within the same order of magnitude when compared to two proprietary measurement systems. In conclusion, the OS4PP system, which costs less than 70% of manual proprietary systems, is comparable electrically while offering automated 100 micron positional accuracy for measuring sheet resistance over larger areas.",,

With few exceptions, such test systems are discontinuous. They require exposure of the biological test material in small units, such as multiwell plates, during prolonged incubation periods, and do not allow online read-outs. It is mostly due to these shortcomings that applications in continuous monitoring of, e.g., drinking or surface water quality are largely missing. We propose the use of pipetting robots that can be used to automatically exchange samples in multiwell plates with fresh samples in a semi-static manner, as a potential solution to overcome these limitations. In this study, we developed a simple and low-cost, versatile pipetting robot constructed partly using open source hardware that has a small footprint and can be used for online monitoring of water quality by means of an automated whole-organism bioassay. We tested its precision in automated 2-fold dilution series and used it for exposure of zebrafish embryos (Danio rerio) a common model species in ecotoxicology to cadmium chloride and permethrin. We found that, compared to conventional static or semi-static exposure scenarios, effects of the two chemicals in zebrafish embryos generally occurred at lower concentrations, and analytically verified that the increased frequency of media exchange resulted in a greater availability of the chemical. In combination with advanced detection systems this custom-made pipetting robot has the potential to become a valuable tool in future monitoring strategies for drinking and surface water.",,

In this paper we detail the design, fabrication and validation of an open-source framework that we designed to lower the barrier to entry for integrating soft robotic subsystems. This framework is built on ROS (the Robot Operating System) and we use it to demonstrate a modular, soft-hard hybrid system which is capable of completing pick and place tasks.

This ""Do-It-Yourself"" interface comprised a 1.0 mx0.25 mm segment of MTX-5 metallic column and a low-cost DC power supply. Thermal desorption modulation (TDM) was attained using a dual-stage heater-based modulator in a novel segmented-loop configuration. TDM was achieved by alternating analyte trapping and thermal desorption. Former process relied on analyte partition to sorbent phase, while latter explored direct resistive heating. Introduction of an intermediate delay segment between the two stages mitigated analyte breakthrough, improving peak symmetry and chromatographic efficiency. This feature was critical to acquire reliable GCxGC modulation using such simple heater-based device. The effects of important modulation variables on 2D separations were investigated, including TDM stage length, dimension of delay loop, and outlet pressure. Significant advances and limitations of proposed TDM strategy were carefully determined. Proposed GCxGC prototype by using an in-oven TDM modulator was successfully applied to a series of challenging matrices, including petroleum distillates, biodiesel, and essential oil. This open-hardware, cost-effective modulator was easy to install and operate, as it circumvented the need for sophisticated components (e.g. moving parts and cooling systems). Therefore, our modulator is a compelling alternative to existing GCxGC solutions to operate in resource-limited laboratories.",,

First, we discuss methods for Hapkit personalization and customization that can be achieved by K-12 students and educators. Next, we describe two kinesthetic haptic device designs that evolved from the original Hapkit 3.0. One uses two standard Hapkits with additional components to form a Pantograph mechanism, and the other uses customized Hapkit elements along with a novel kinematic design to form a serial mechanism. These designs are modular; after building two Hapkits, a user acquires a small number of additional parts to transform them into a two-degree-of-freedom device. The Pantograph mechanism was used in an undergraduate class to teach robotics and haptics to both engineering and nonengineering students.

The popular-priced and portable open source hardware is used as a bridge between CACSD tools and real plants to deliver the control and sensor data at the sampling time points. Ten I/O function blocks written in C code are developed based on the CACSD tool employed for the proposed light-weight RCP system in order to handle I/O operation in a simple way. In addition, we suggest two practical strategies, a batch transfer strategy and a variable sampling period method, to increase the sampling rate of the control system. It is shown through experiment that the proposed light-weight RCP system works well up to a sampling rate of 2 kHz without adopting expensive hardware and C code generators. It is expected that the proposed RCP system will be considered as affordable and readily available to schools for mass education.",,

These plants face several technical problems and the inspection of components such as absorber tubes in parabolic trough concentrators (PTC), which are widely deployed, is necessary to guarantee plant efficiency. This article presents a system for real-time industrial inspection of CSP plants using low-cost, open-source components in conjunction with a thermographic sensor and an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). The system, available in open-source hardware and software, is designed to be employed independently of the type of device used for inspection (laptop, smartphone, tablet or smartglasses) and its operating system. Several UAV flight missions were programmed as follows: flight altitudes at 20, 40, 60, 80, 100 and 120 m above ground level; and three cruising speeds: 5, 7 and 10 m/s. These settings were chosen and analyzed in order to optimize inspection time. The results indicate that it is possible to perform inspections by an UAV in real time at CSP plants as a means of detecting anomalous absorber tubes and improving the effectiveness of methodologies currently being utilized. Moreover, aside from thermographic sensors, this contribution can be applied to other sensors and can be used in a broad range of applications where real-time georeferenced data visualization is necessary.",,

ROACH is an open-source hardware and software platform featuring a large Xilinx Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA), Power PC processor, several 10 GB Ethernet SFP+ interfaces, and a collection of daughter boards for analog signal generation and acquisition. The combination of a ROACH board, ADC/DAC conversion daughter boards, and hardware for RF mixing allows for the generation and capture of multiple RF tones for reading out microwave multiplexed X-ray TES microcalorimeters. The FPGA is used to generate multiple tones in base band, from 10 MHz to 250 MHz, which are subsequently mixed to RF in the multiple GHz range and sent through the microwave multiplexer. The tones are generated in theFPGAby storing a large lookup table in Quad Data Rate SRAM modules and playing out the waveform to a DAC board. Once the signal has been modulated to RF, passed through the microwave multiplexer, and has been modulated back to base band, the signal is digitized by an ADC board. The tones are modulated to 0 Hz by using a FPGA circuit consisting of a polyphase filter bank, several Xilinx FFT blocks, Xilinx CORDIC blocks (for converting to magnitude and phase), and special phase accumulator circuit for mixing to exactly 0 Hz. Upwards of 256 channels can be simultaneously captured and written into a bank of 256 First-In-First-Out (FIFO) memories, with each FIFO corresponding to a channel. Individual channel data can be further processed in the FPGA before being streamed through a 10 GB Ethernet fiber-optic interface to a Linux system. The Linux system runs software written in Python and QT C++ for controlling the ROACH system, capturing data, and processing data.",,

Given that advent of Internet of Things (IoT) era due to mobile technology progressions, the future needs a sorting method that is available on any environment, such as not only high performance systems like servers but also low computational performance machines like embedded systems. In this paper, we present an FPGA-based sorting accelerator combining Sorting Network and Merge Sorter Tree, which is customizable by means of tuning design parameters. The proposed FPGA accelerator sorts data sent from a host PC via the PCIe bus, and sends back the fully sorted data sequence to it. We also present a detailed analytical model that accurately estimates the sorting performance. Due to these characteristics, designers can know how fast a developed sorting hardware is in advance and can implement the best one to fulfill the cost and performance constraints. Our experiments show that the proposed hardware achieves up to 19.5x sorting performance, compared with Intel Core i7-3770K operating at 3.50GHz, when sorting 256M 32-bits integer elements. However, this result is limited because of insufficient memory bandwidth. To overcome this problem, we propose a data compression mechanism and the experimental result shows that the sorting hardware with it achieves almost 90% of the estimated performance, while the hardware without it does about 60%. In order to allow every designer to easily and freely use this accelerator, the RTL source code is released as open-source hardware.",,

However, entering this field of research is difficult since such an implant requires components from many different areas of technology. Since the complete avoidance of wires is important due to the risk of infections and other long-term problems, means for wirelessly transmitting data and energy are a necessity which adds to the requirements. In recent literature, many high-tech components for such implants are presented with remarkable properties. However, these components are typically not freely available for such a system. Every group needs to re-develop their own solution. This raises the question if it is possible to create a reusable design for an implant and its external base-station, such that it allows other groups to use it as a starting point. In this article, we try to answer this question by presenting a design based exclusively on commercial off-the-shelf components and studying the properties of the resulting system.

De um lado, há o surgimento de políticas e interesses governamentais nos EUA, China, Cingapura, Taiwam e Europa, sobre o tal “movimento maker”, levando diretamente ao atual chamado nacionalista do tipo “Faça (o país XYZ) Grande Novamente”. De outro lado, os projetos e atividades maker (experimentações com Arduino, construção de impressoras 3D, montagem de infraestruturas de laboratórios de biologia faça-voçê-mesmo), continuam restritos a um nicho exploratório e privado, mesmo quando são parte de redes informais e transnacionais (Vertesi et al. 2011; Kaiying & Lindtner 2016) que eu denomino “diplomacia geek” (Kera 2015). Sem afirmar claramente qualquer agenda local ou transnacional, os makers faça-você-mesmo negociam de maneira produtiva e criativa várias dicotomias entre o individualismo e o coletivismo, entre os interesses locais e globais, nacionalismo e cosmopolitismo. Eles conectam politica e design através da liminaridade, em experiencias individuais e exploratórias de prototipagem e tinkering, que diferem muito das formas de aquisição de conhecimentos, habilidades e prototipagem típicas dos contextos industriais e acadêmicos. Para explicar a liminaridade na cultura maker, eu expando o trabalho pioneiro de Gabriela Coleman sobre os paradoxos do movimento hacker (e do movimento de software aberto). As redes descentralizadas e transnacionais de makers e hackers são exemplos (tecnológicos) de comunidades e liminaridades (Turner, 1969), que negociam vários objetivos e agendas conflitantes por trás da fabricação, tecnologia e globalização. A cultura maker pode servir a agendas isolacionistas ou cosmopolitas ao mesmo tempo, e ainda abraçar a retórica do código aberto enquanto segue parcialmente patenteada, pirateada e híbrida. Ela mobiliza as esperanças do Sul Global de tecnologias de baixo custo, enquanto performatiza clichés do Vale do Silício e se utiliza do trabalho escravo e migrante na China, ou ainda de algum conflito africano sobre recursos minerais. Ao invés de empoderar alguma noção idealizada de sujeito, comunidade ou mesmo nação, ela demarca os limites e as condições do nosso entendimento sobre governança e sua relação com a produção, a fabricação e o design.Palavras-chave: Cultura Maker; Hardware de Fonte Aberta; Política e Design; Sul Global.ABSTRACT Maker culture defined as a set of Open Source Hardware (OSHW) tools (Weiss 2008; Mellis & Buechley 2011; Ames et al. 2014), DIY practices (Ratto & Boler 2014; Ames et al. 2014; Lindtner et al. 2016) and promises of digital, automated and distributed fabrication (Gershenfeld et al. 2004; Ratto & Ree 2012) or democratized science equipment (Pearce 2014; Pearce 2012) remains an ambiguous object of our recent political and design fantasies.  On one side, there is a surge of government and policy interests in the so called ""maker movements"" in the U.S., China, Singapore, Taiwan, and EU leading directly to the present nationalist calls for ""Making (XYZ nation) great again"". On the other, maker projects and activities (Arduino tinkering, building 3D printers,  setting up a DIYbio lab infrastructure)  remain niche, exploratory and private, even when they are part of the informal, transnational networks (Vertesi et al. 2011; Kaiying & Lindtner 2016), which I call ""geek diplomacy"" (Kera 2015).  Without clearly stating any local or transnational agenda, the DIY makers productively and creatively negotiate the various dichotomies between individualism and collectivism, local and global interests, nationalism and cosmopolitanism. They connect politics and design through ""liminal,"" meaning individual and exploratory, experiences of prototyping and tinkering which differ greatly from the knowledge and skills acquisitions or prototyping common in the industrial or academic context. To explain this liminality in the maker culture, I extended Gabriella Coleman's (2012) pioneering work on the paradoxes of hacker (and open source software) movement. The decentralized and transnational networks of makers and hackers are examples of (technological) communitas and liminality (Turner 1969), which negotiate various conflicting goals and agenda behind making, technology and globalization.  The maker culture can serve isolationist and cosmopolitan agendas at the same time, even embrace the open source rhetoric while remaining partially patented, pirated and hybrid. It mobilizes the Global South hopes of low cost technologies while performing the Silicon Valley clichés and using migrant slave labor in China, but also African conflict minerals. Rather than empowering some idealized notion of the subject, community or even nation, it demarcates the limits and conditions of our understanding of governance and its relation to production, making, and design.Keywords: Maker Culture; Open Source Hardware; Politics and Design; Global South.",http://revista.ibict.br/liinc/article/viewFile/3875/3202,

De um lado, há o surgimento de políticas e interesses governamentais nos EUA, China, Cingapura, Taiwam e Europa, sobre o tal “movimento maker”, levando diretamente ao atual chamado nacionalista do tipo “Faça (o país XYZ) Grande Novamente”. De outro lado, os projetos e atividades maker (experimentações com Arduino, construção de impressoras 3D, montagem de infraestruturas de laboratórios de biologia faça-voçê- mesmo), continuam restritos a um nicho exploratório e privado, mesmo quando são parte de redes informais e transnacionais (Vertesi et al. 2011; Kaiying & Lindtner 2016) que eu denomino “diplomacia geek” (Kera 2015). Sem afirmar claramente qualquer agenda local ou transnacional, os makers faça-você- mesmo negociam de maneira produtiva e criativa várias dicotomias entre o individualismo e o coletivismo, entre os interesses locais e globais, nacionalismo e cosmopolitismo. Eles conectam politica e design através da liminaridade, em experiencias individuais e exploratórias de prototipagem e tinkering, que diferem muito das formas de aquisição de conhecimentos, habilidades e prototipagem típicas dos contextos industriais e acadêmicos. Para explicar a liminaridade na cultura maker, eu expando o trabalho pioneiro de Gabriela Coleman sobre os paradoxos do movimento hacker (e do movimento de software aberto). As redes descentralizadas e transnacionais de makers e hackers são exemplos (tecnológicos) de comunidades e liminaridades (Turner, 1969), que negociam vários objetivos e agendas conflitantes por trás da fabricação, tecnologia e globalização. A cultura maker pode servir a agendas isolacionistas ou cosmopolitas ao mesmo tempo, e ainda abraçar a retórica do código aberto enquanto segue parcialmente patenteada, pirateada e híbrida. Ela mobiliza as esperanças do Sul Global de tecnologias de baixo custo, enquanto performatiza clichés do Vale do Silício e se utiliza do trabalho escravo e migrante na China, ou ainda de algum conflito africano sobre recursos minerais. Ao invés de empoderar alguma noção idealizada de sujeito, comunidade ou mesmo nação, ela demarca os limites e as condições do nosso entendimento sobre governança e sua relação com a produção, a fabricação e o design. Palavras-chave: Cultura Maker; Hardware de Fonte Aberta; Política e Design; Sul GlobalLink: http://revista.ibict.br/liinc/article/view/3875/3202",,

Due to this, previous neural architecture search (NAS) methods are computationally expensive. ConvNet architecture optimality depends on factors such as input resolution and target devices. However, existing approaches are too resource demanding for case-by-case redesigns. Also, previous work focuses primarily on reducing FLOPs, but FLOP count does not always reflect actual latency. To address these, we propose a differentiable neural architecture search (DNAS) framework that uses gradient-based methods to optimize ConvNet architectures, avoiding enumerating and training individual architectures separately as in previous methods. FBNets (Facebook-Berkeley-Nets), a family of models discovered by DNAS surpass state-of-the-art models both designed manually and generated automatically. FBNet-B achieves 74.1% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet with 295M FLOPs and 23.1 ms latency on a Samsung S8 phone, 2.4x smaller and 1.5x faster than MobileNetV2-1.3 with similar accuracy. Despite higher accuracy and lower latency than MnasNet, we estimate FBNet-B's search cost is 420x smaller than MnasNet's, at only 216 GPU-hours. Searched for different resolutions and channel sizes, FBNets achieve 1.5% to 6.4% higher accuracy than MobileNetV2. The smallest FBNet achieves 50.2% accuracy and 2.9 ms latency (345 frames per second) on a Samsung S8. Over a Samsung-optimized FBNet, the iPhone-X-optimized model achieves a 1.4x speedup on an iPhone X. FBNet models are open-sourced at https://github. com/facebookresearch/mobile-vision.",,

GPlates allows the building of topological plate models representing the mosaic of evolving plate boundary networks through time, useful for computing plate velocity fields as surface boundary conditions for mantle convection models and for investigating physical and chemical exchanges of material between the surface and the deep Earth along tectonic plate boundaries. The ability of GPlates to visualize subsurface 3‐D scalar fields together with traditional geological surface data enables researchers to analyze their relationships through geological time in a common plate tectonic reference frame. To achieve this, a hierarchical cube map framework is used for rendering reconstructed surface raster data to support the rendering of subsurface 3‐D scalar fields using graphics‐hardware‐accelerated ray‐tracing techniques. GPlates enables the construction of plate deformation zones—regions combining extension, compression, and shearing that accommodate the relative motion between rigid blocks. Users can explore how strain rates, stretching/shortening factors, and crustal thickness evolve through space and time and interactively update the kinematics associated with deformation. Where data sets described by geometries (points, lines, or polygons) fall within deformation regions, the deformation can be applied to these geometries. Together, these tools allow users to build virtual Earth models that quantitatively describe continental assembly, fragmentation and dispersal and are interoperable with many other mapping and modeling tools, enabling applications in tectonics, geodynamics, basin evolution, orogenesis, deep Earth resource exploration, paleobiology, paleoceanography, and paleoclimate.",,

In particular, the recent boom in passive acoustic sensors has provided efficient, noninvasive, and taxonomically broad means to study wildlife populations and communities, and monitor their responses to environmental change. However, until recently, technological costs and constraints have largely confined research in passive acoustic monitoring (PAM) to a handful of taxonomic groups (e.g., bats, cetaceans, birds), often in relatively small‐scale, proof‐of‐concept studies. The arrival of low‐cost, open‐source sensors is now rapidly expanding access to PAM technologies, making it vital to evaluate where these tools can contribute to broader efforts in ecology and biodiversity research. Here, we synthesise and critically assess the current emerging opportunities and challenges for PAM for ecological assessment and monitoring of both species populations and communities. We show that terrestrial and marine PAM applications are advancing rapidly, facilitated by emerging sensor hardware, the application of machine learning innovations to automated wildlife call identification, and work towards developing acoustic biodiversity indicators. However, the broader scope of PAM research remains constrained by limited availability of reference sound libraries and open‐source audio processing tools, especially for the tropics, and lack of clarity around the accuracy, transferability and limitations of many analytical methods. In order to improve possibilities for PAM globally, we emphasise the need for collaborative work to develop standardised survey and analysis protocols, publicly archived sound libraries, multiyear audio datasets, and a more robust theoretical and analytical framework for monitoring vocalising animal communities.",,

The cost, usability and power efficiency of available wildlife monitoring equipment currently inhibits full ground-level coverage of many natural systems. Developments over the last decade in technology, open science, and the sharing economy promise to bring global access to more versatile and more affordable monitoring tools, to improve coverage for conservation researchers and managers. 2. Here we describe the development and proof-of-concept of a low-cost, small-sized and low-energy acoustic detector: ""AudioMoth."" The device is open-source and programmable, with diverse applications for recording animal calls or human activity at sample rates of up to 384 kHz. We briefly outline two ongoing real-world case studies of large-scale, long-term monitoring for biodiversity and exploitation of natural resources. These studies demonstrate the potential for AudioMoth to enable a substantial shift away from passive continuous recording by individual devices, towards smart detection by networks of devices flooding large and inaccessible ecosystems. 3. The case studies demonstrate one of the smart capabilities of AudioMoth, to trigger event logging on the basis of classification algorithms that identify specific acoustic events. An algorithm to trigger recordings of the New Forest cicada (Cicadetta montana) demonstrates the potential for AudioMoth to vastly improve the spatial and temporal coverage of surveys for the presence of cryptic animals. An algorithm for logging gunshot events has potential to identify a shotgun blast in tropical rainforest at distances of up to 500 m, extending to 1 km with continuous recording. 4. AudioMoth is more energy efficient than currently available passive acoustic monitoring devices, giving it considerably greater portability and longevity in the field with smaller batteries. At a build cost of similar to US$43 per unit, AudioMoth has potential for varied applications in large-scale, long-term acoustic surveys. With continuing developments in smart, energy-efficient algorithms and diminishing component costs, we are approaching the milestone of local communities being able to afford to remotely monitor their own natural resources.",,

This approach simplifies the design, and decreases both the size and the cost of the hardware; it also makes the UWED adaptable to different types of analyses by simple modification of the software. The UWED can perform the most common electroanalytical techniques of potentiometry, chronoamperometry, cyclic voltammetry, and square wave voltammetry, with results closely comparable to benchtop commercial potentiostats. Although the operating ranges of electrical current and voltage of the UWED (±1.5 V, ±180 μA) are more limited than most benchtop commercial potentiostats, its functional range is sufficient for most electrochemical analyses in aqueous solutions. Because the UWED is simple, small in size, assembled from inexpensive components, and completely wireless, it offers new opportunities for the development of affordable diagnostics, sensors, and wearable devices.",,

One such enabling technologies is fog computing, which extends cloud computing to the edge of a network allowing for developing novel Internet of Things (IoT) applications and services. Under the IoT fog computing paradigm, IoT gateways are usually utilized to exchange messages with IoT nodes and a cloud. WiFi and ZigBee stand out as preferred communication technologies for smart homes. WiFi has become very popular, but it has a limited application due to its high energy consumption and the lack of standard mesh networking capabilities for low-power devices. For such reasons, ZigBee was selected by many manufacturers for developing wireless home automation devices. As a consequence, these technologies may coexist in the 2.4 GHz band, which leads to collisions, lower speed rates and increased communications latencies. This article presents ZiWi, a distributed fog computing Home Automation System (HAS) that allows for carrying out seamless communications among ZigBee and WiFi devices. This approach diverges from traditional home automation systems, which often rely on expensive central controllers. In addition, to ease the platform’s building process, whenever possible, the system makes use of open-source software (all the code of the nodes is available on GitHub) and Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) hardware. The initial results, which were obtained in a number of representative home scenarios, show that the developed fog services respond several times faster than the evaluated cloud services, and that cross-interference has to be taken seriously to prevent collisions. In addition, the current consumption of ZiWi’s nodes was measured, showing the impact of encryption mechanisms.",,

Recommendations for designing an ultra-reliable communications system for UAV swarms are introduced with a focus on the software protocol stack and RF hardware. For the purpose of demonstration, we developed Easy- Swarm, an open-source UAV swarming platform that adopts the LoRa radio at the physical layer and a low-latency channel access protocol at the MAC layer. Real-life testbeds are built consisting of 10 UAVs and 20 robotic cars that produce background traffic. LoRa, WiFi and LTE networks are employed to provide broadband and cellular wireless network support. Results show that using LoRa leads to better reliability, in particular allowing for higher swarm density and longer coverage distance, than when WiFi is used.

Based on these observations, we highlight the best practices that could foster a more active community around quantum computing software that welcomes newcomers to the field, but also ensures high-quality, well-documented code.",,

The prominent Meltdown and Spectre attacks abruptly revealed fundamental design flaws in CPU pipeline behavior and exception handling logic, urging the research community to systematically study attack surface from microarchitectural interactions. We present Nemesis, a previously overlooked side-channel attack vector that abuses the CPU's interrupt mechanism to leak microarchitectural instruction timings from enclaved execution environments such as Intel SGX, Sancus, and TrustLite. At its core, Nemesis abuses the same subtle microarchitectural behavior that enables Meltdown, i.e., exceptions and interrupts are delayed until instruction retirement. We show that by measuring the latency of a carefully timed interrupt, an attacker controlling the system software is able to infer instruction-granular execution state from hardware-enforced enclaves. In contrast to speculative execution vulnerabilities, our novel attack vector is applicable to the whole computing spectrum, from small embedded sensor nodes to high-end commodity x86 hardware. We present practical interrupt timing attacks against the open-source Sancus embedded research processor, and we show that interrupt latency reveals microarchitectural instruction timings from off-the-shelf Intel SGX enclaves. Finally, we discuss challenges for mitigating Nemesis-type attacks at the hardware and software levels.",,

In this paper we explore the implications cloud microservices have on system bottlenecks, and datacenter server design. We first present and characterize an end-to-end application built using tens of popular open-source microservices that implements a movie renting and streaming service, and is modular and extensible. We then use the end-to-end service to study the scalability and performance bottlenecks of microservices, and highlight implications they have on the design of datacenter hardware. Specifically, we revisit the long-standing debate of brawny versus wimpy cores in the context of microservices, we quantify the I-cache pressure they introduce, and measure the time spent in computation versus communication between microservices over RPCs. As more cloud applications switch to this new programming model, it is increasingly important to revisit the assumptions we have previously used to build and manage cloud systems.",,

Being SDR-based, the transceiver offers important benefits: It provides access to all data down to and including the physical layer, allowing for a better understanding of the system. Based on open and programmable hardware and software, the transceiver is completely transparent and all implementation details can be studied and, if needed, modified. Finally, it enables a seamless switch between simulations and experiments and, thus, helps to bridge the gap between theory and practice. Comparing the transceiver’s performance with independent results from simulations and experiments, we underline its potential to be used as a tool for further studies of IEEE 802.11p networks both in field operational tests as well as for simulation-based development of novel physical layer solutions.

This leads to an approximately fourfold increase in computational demand over additive force fields.

In this paper, we present OpenUAV, an open source test bed for UAV education and research that overcomes these barriers. We leverage the Containers as a Service (CaaS) technology to enable students and researchers carry out simulations on the cloud. We have based our framework on open-source tools including ROS, Gazebo, Docker, PX4, and Ansible, we designed the simulation framework so that it has no special hardware requirements. Two use-cases are presented. First, we show how a UAV can navigate around obstacles, and second, we test a multi-UAV swarm formation algorithm. To our knowledge, this is the first open-source, cloud-enabled testbed for UAVs. The code is available on GitHub: https://github.com/Open-UAV.",,

While some network slicing prototypes have been built for RANs, leveraging on the wide availability of radio hardware and open source software, there is currently no open source suite for end-to-end network slicing available to the research community. In this article we fill this gap by developing an end-to-end network slicing protocol stack, POSENS, which relies on a slice-aware shared RAN solution. We design the required algorithms and protocols, and provide a full implementation leveraging on state-of-the-art software components. We validate the effectiveness of POSENS in achieving tenant isolation and network slices customization, showing that no price in performance is paid toward this end. We believe that our tool will prove very useful to researchers and practitioners working on this novel architectural paradigm.",,

One of the most fundamental questions relating to these phenomena is why developers contribute their private resources to these public goods. While this question has been discussed, theorized, and empirically investigated in the context of OSS, there has been no research so far in the context of OSH. Can we really assume the motivations behind the development of the OSH to be the same as those behind OSS? Based on the self&#8208;determination theory (SDT), we provide original insights into the motivations behind contributions to OSH development. We collected data from the most common and active 3D printing communities, which are the main loci of OSH development. We thus have a unique cross&#8208;sectional data set with participants from over 30 different countries using all kinds of different OSH platforms. Our analysis reveals several important findings: firstly, the motivations are in some aspects very similar to those in open source software notwithstanding different possibilities, hurdles, and incentives regarding the OSS and OSH. Above all, enjoyment&#8208;based intrinsic motivation is a major factor affecting contribution levels. Secondly, among internalized extrinsic motivations, expected private benefits through improving own skills stands out. Thirdly, different factors of internalized extrinsic motivations can have different moderating effects on the effect of enjoyment&#8208;based intrinsic motivation. Given the imminent changes in business models throughout manufacturing industries in order to adapt to the challenge that OSH will increasingly pose, our findings have important implications not only for OSH communities and 3D development platforms, but also for businesses that want and probably soon have to engage in open innovation.",,

Further, new applications such as cloud computing and Internet of Things (IoT) continue to necessitate increased performance and energy efficiency. Manycore processors show potential in addressing some of these issues. However, there is little detailed power and energy data on manycore processors. In this work, we carefully study detailed power and energy characteristics of Piton, a 25-core modern open source academic processor, including voltage versus frequency scaling, energy per instruction (EPI), memory system energy, network-on-chip (NoC) energy, thermal characteristics, and application performance and power consumption. This is the first detailed power and energy characterization of an open source manycore design implemented in silicon. The open source nature of the processor provides increased value, enabling detailed characterization verified against simulation and the ability to correlate results with the design and register transfer level (RTL) model. Additionally, this enables other researchers to utilize this work to build new power models, devise new research directions, and perform accurate power and energy research using the open source processor. The characterization data reveals a number of interesting insights, including that operand values have a large impact on EPI, recomputing data can be more energy efficient than loading it from memory, on-chip data transmission (NoC) energy is low, and insights on energy efficient multithreaded core design.

This large-cat sized, 5.1 kg robot is one of a kind of a recent, bioinspired legged robot class designed with the capability of model-free locomotion control. Animal legged locomotion in rough terrain is clearly shaped by sensor feedback systems. Results with Oncilla robot show that agile and versatile locomotion is possible without sensory signals to some extend, and tracking becomes robust when feedback control is added (Ajallooeian, 2015). By incorporating mechanical and control blueprints inspired from animals, and by observing the resulting robot locomotion characteristics, we aim to understand the contribution of individual components. Legged robots have a wide mechanical and control design parameter space, and a unique potential as research tools to investigate principles of biomechanics and legged locomotion control. But the hardware and controller design can be a steep initial hurdle for academic research. To facilitate the easy start and development of legged robots, Oncilla-robot's blueprints are available through open-source. The robot's locomotion capabilities are shown in several scenarios. Specifically, its spring-loaded pantographic leg design compensates for overdetermined body and leg postures, i.e., during turning maneuvers, locomotion outdoors, or while going up and down slopes. The robot's active degree of freedom allow tight and swift direction changes, and turns on the spot. Presented hardware experiments are conducted in an open-loop manner, with little control and computational effort. For more versatile locomotion control, Oncilla-robot can sense leg joint rotations, and leg-trunk forces. Additional sensors can be included for feedback control with an open communication protocol interface. The robot's customized actuators are designed for robust actuation, and efficient locomotion. It trots with a cost of transport of 3.2 J/(Nm), at a speed of 0.63 m s-1 (Froude number 0.25). The robot trots inclined slopes up to 10°, at 0.25 m s-1. The multi-body Webots model of Oncilla robot, and Oncilla robot's extensive software architecture enables users to design and test scenarios in simulation. Controllers can directly be transferred to the real robot. Oncilla robot's blueprints are open-source published (hardware GLP v3, software LGPL v3).",,

This study shows how a real-world smart stormwater system can be leveraged to shape streamflow within an urban watershed. Specifically, we coordinate releases from two internet-controlled stormwater basins to achieve desired control objectives downstream such as maintaining the flow at a set-point, and generating interleaved waves. In the first part of the study, we describe the construction of the control network using a low-cost, open-source hardware stack and a cloud-based controller scheduling application. Next, we characterize the system's control capabilities by determining the travel times, decay times, and magnitudes of various waves released from the upstream retention basins. With this characterization in hand, we use the system to generate two desired responses at a critical downstream junction. First, we generate a set-point hydrograph, in which flow is maintained at an approximately constant rate. Next, we generate a series of overlapping and interleaved waves using timed releases from both retention basins. We discuss how these control strategies can be used to stabilize flows, thereby mitigating streambed erosion and reducing contaminant loads into downstream waterbodies.",,

To test this conceptual design, this study proposes a sensorization node to monitor meteorological phenomena. The node is called SEnviro (node) and features different improvements such as: the possibility of remote updates using Over-the-Air (OTA) updates; autonomy, using 3G connectivity, a solar panel, and applied energy strategies to prolong its life; and replicability, because it is made up of open hardware and other elements such as 3D-printed pieces.

This work enables accurate, hardware-validated performance, power, and energy modelling of CPUs by first presenting a methodology to evaluate and identify sources of error in CPU performance models, and secondly developing empirical power models optimised for use with such performance models. Hierarchical clustering, correlation analysis, and regression techniques are used to identify sources of error without requiring detailed CPU specifications and enable existing models to be improved, new models to be developed, validation of simulator changes, and testing of model suitability for specific use-cases. Furthermore, the GemStone open-source software tool is presented, which automates the process of characterising hardware platforms, identifying sources of error in gem5 models, applying power analysis, and quantifying the effect of errors on the performance, power, and energy estimations. In addition, the mean percentage error in execution time was found to swing from -51% to +10% between two versions of the same gem5 model, underlining the need for an automated tool to validate models against reference hardware, ensuring accuracy and consistency.",,

The most concerning threats are hardware trojans. A hardware trojan is a malicious inclusion or alteration to the existing design of an integrated circuit, with the possible effects ranging from leakage of sensitive information to the complete destruction of the integrated circuit itself. While the majority of existing detection schemes focus on test-time, they all require expensive methodologies to detect hardware trojans. Off-the-shelf approaches have often been overlooked due to limited hardware resources and detection accuracy. With the advances in technologies and the democratisation of open-source hardware, however, these tools enable the detection of hardware trojans at reduced costs during or after production. In this manuscript, a hardware trojan is created and emulated on a consumer FPGA board. The experiments to detect the trojan in a dormant and active state are made using off-the-shelf technologies taking advantage of different techniques such as Power Analysis Reports, Side Channel Analysis and Thermal Measurements. Furthermore, multiple attempts to detect the trojan are demonstrated and benchmarked. Our simulations result in a state-of-the-art methodology to accurately detect the trojan in both dormant and active states using off-the-shelf hardware.",,

However, moderate miniaturization offers many advantages and together with the transfer of modern print and media technologies to the field of chromatography (office chromatography) it opens up new avenues. This is demonstrated in an allin-one open-source system developed for planar chromatography and especially for ultrathin-layer chromatography. Using an InkShield board to control a thermal inkjet cartridge, picoliter drops were printed at a resolution of 96 dpi on the adsorbent layer. Using Marlin, a popular firmware in 3D printing, Cartesian movement of the print head was made possible for full control of the printing process. Open-source software was developed to control the device in each operation step. Sample solutions and mobile phase were inkjet-printed, exemplarily shown for the analysis of dye- or paraben-mixture solutions. Light-emitting diodes (LEDs) were investigated for documentation. For example, deep UV LEDs gave access to 254 nm light, and RGB LEDs gave access to the visible-light range. Calibration functions with correlation coefficients superior to 0.999 were obtained by videodensitometry. The developed modular open-source hardware was compact (26 X 31 X 26 cm(3)), light (<3 kg), and affordable ((sic)810).

IVSP presents the design of a networked system for joint rate control and error control of video over resource-constrained embedded devices. First, a combination of two different congestion indicators is introduced to differentiate between congestion levels and handle them accordingly. Second, a feedback-based rate controller is developed to maximize received video quality, in which sensor nodes can adaptively adjust their sending rates. Finally, a different retransmission mechanism for different packets is proposed. Lost packets can be stored temporarily and resend when free channel is available to avoid congestion.

Such standard research agreements thus create an artificial barrier to innovation as both companies using a libre model and universities they wish to collaborate with must invest significantly to restructure the contracts. To solve this problem, this article provides a new Sponsored Libre Research Agreement (SLRA). The differences between the agreements are detailed. The advantages of using an SLRA are provided for any type of company and include: (1) minimizing research investments on reporting requirements; (2) reducing delays related to confidentiality and publication embargos; and (3) reducing both transaction and legal costs as well as research time losses associated with IP.

Traditional methods involve operator intervention with gravimetric analysis to monitor the gross accuracy of full plate dispenses, visual verification of contents, or dedicated weigh stations on screening platforms that introduce potential bottlenecks and increase the plate-processing cycle time. We present a unique solution using open-source hardware, software, and 3D printing to automate dispenser accuracy determination by providing real-time dispense weight measurements via a network-connected precision balance. This system uses an Arduino microcontroller to connect a precision balance to a local network. By integrating the precision balance as an Internet of Things (IoT) device, it gains the ability to provide real-time gravimetric summaries of dispensing, generate timely alerts when problems are detected, and capture historical dispensing data for future analysis.

This amplification is connected with the resonant frequency, which can be estimated applying the horizontal-to-vertical spectral ratio (1-1/V) method on seismic noise measurements. In this work, a low-cost user-friendly data acquisition system (Geophonino-3D) has been designed for three-component seismic noise recording. The developed system consists of the signal conditioning circuit and the Arduino Due with an SD Shield for data storage. The suitability of the equipment for the application of the H/V method has been first assessed in the laboratory, according to the experimental sensitivity, the internal noise stability and the channel consistency. Subsequently, experimental verification has been carried out by recording seismic noise at eight different sites along the province of Alicante (southeast Spain), with different soil characteristics. The performance of the developed acquisition system has been evaluated in terms of the power spectral density and the H/V peaks by comparison with the results obtained through a commercial seismic recorder. The obtained results show the applicability of the developed acquisition system to record seismic noise and to apply the H/V method. Geophonino-3D is an open source and open hardware system and the price of its components is much lower than any other commercial equipment, which becomes a significant advance especially for small research groups with reduced economic support.

Cost, however, often prevents the use of centrifuges in many teaching labs, greatly limiting educational experiences for students. As a result, we describe how to construct a “homemade” single-speed mini-centrifuge using inexpensive parts easily acquired online or at hardware or other stores (e.g., a 4.7-quart plastic bowl and lid, standard computer cooling fan, AC/DC adapter, electrical wire, etc.). We further used this design and a commercial mini-centrifuge to pellet 1-mL samples of Tetrahymena thermophila, and we found that the two performed comparably. Finally, because our plans and the materials needed to build this device are all open source, we call our design the OPN Minifuge, and we hope that it will help to expand the scope of experiments that students can run in introductory and upper-level biology teaching labs.",,

It aims at determining a portfolio of ciphers for authenticated encryption that has advantages over AES-GCM in terms of performance, security, and ease of implementation. This competition, for the first time, provides a standardized hardware API, which allows a fair comparison of hardware implementations. However, the community still lacks a common platform to automatically test hardware implementations, confirm implementation claims, and benchmark performance figures on real hardware in terms of runtime, area, power and energy consumption. In this work, we present a common platform using the CAESAR-API in a Xilinx Zynq-7000 System on Chip (SoC) with ARM processors and an AXI interface. This reflects a typical real world usage scenario for hardware-accelerators and thus extends the work for a fair comparison of hardware implementations in three dimensions: first the API is evaluated on a real SoC, which shows, e.g. the performance of the API. Second, it provides a hardware platform to test the proposed implementations of the candidates easily. This can be used by future designers, as we will provide it as open source hardware.

This application requires dedicated transmit/receive (Tx/Rx) switches that support high peak powers for MRI and high average powers for RF heating. To meet this goal, we propose a high-performance Tx/Rx switch based on positive-intrinsic-negative diodes and quarter-wavelength (lambda/4) stubs. Methods: The lambda/4 stubs in the proposed Tx/Rx switch design route the transmitted RF signal directly to the RF coil/antenna without passing through any electronic components (e.g., positive-intrinsic-negative diodes). Bench measurements, MRI, MR thermometry, and RF heating experiments were performed at f = 297 MHz (B-0 = 7 T) to examine the characteristics and applicability of the switch. Results: The proposed design provided an isolation of -235.7dB/-241.5dB during transmission/reception. The insertion loss was -20.41dB/-20.27dB during transmission/reception. The switch supports high peak (3.9 kW) and high average (120 W) RF powers for MRI and RF heating at f = 297 MHz. High-resolution MRI of the wrist yielded image quality competitive with that obtained with a conventional Tx/Rx switch. Radiofrequency heating in phantom monitored by MR thermometry demonstrated the switch applicability for thermal modulation. Upon these findings, thermally activated release of a model drug attached to thermoresponsive polymers was demonstrated. Conclusion: The high-power Tx/Rx switch enables thermal MR applications at 7 T, contributing to the study of the role of temperature in biological systems and diseases. All design files of the switch will be made available open source at www.opensourceimaging.org.",,

To validate the simulated results, the simulated velocity and accelerations are compared with the data acquired with an inertial measurement unit (IMU) installed on the bicycle.

The challenge is to consider all of the different structures and components available and build the optimal power management on a microscale. The purpose of this paper is to streamline the design process by creating a novel reconfigurable testbed called Medlay. First, we propose a uniform interface for management functions e.g., power conversion, energy storing and power routing. This interface results in a clear layout because power and status pins are strictly separated, and inputs and outputs have fixed positions. Medlay is the ready-to-use and open-hardware platform based on the interface. It consists of a base board and small modules incorporating e.g., dc-dc converters, power switches and supercapacitors. Measurements confirm that Medlay represents a system on one circuit board, as parasitic effects of the interconnections are negligible. The versatility regarding different setups on the testbed is determined to over 250,000 combinations by layout graph grammar. Lastly, we underline the applicability by recreating three state-of-the-art systems with the testbed. In conclusion, Medlay facilitates building and testing power management in a very compact, clear and extensible fashion.",,

Peer-production and contribution cultures are enfolded in a dynamic of resistance and appropriation in relation to capitalism. Open-source and contribution-based cultural processes have been critiqued as tending towards bureaucracy or becoming enfolded in a never-ending neoliberal imaginary from which escape or transcendence become impossible. An examination of the values expressed within a peer-production community challenges these perspectives and shows how ""operational pragmatics"" can provide moral justifications through reference to matters of principle and matters of design. Conflating these matters complicates claims about the inherent virtues of participation, especially in technical cultures. A qualitative analysis of an open-source hardware project shows how competing moral justifications unfold, and how the challenges that they pose to capitalism may be tenuous or temporary because of the way that justificatory regimes work within technology development under capitalism.",,

Further development in this area is coupling open source electronics with 3-D printable mechanical components to make fully functional distributedly-manufactured mechatronic tools for science. One research area where such low-cost technology is needed is to characterize thin film anti-reflective coatings and transparent conducting oxides (TCOs) for the glass, mirror and solar photovoltaic industry whose transmission properties are angle dependent. To meet this research need a low-cost 3-D printable open source dual axis gimbal system is presented in this study. An Arduino based microcontroller is used to move the sample holder to the user specified angle where two stepper motors control the motion providing two degrees of freedom. The sample holder is made in such a way that samples can easily be mounted on it by two movable latches. The system was validated and characterized for: i) unidirectional accuracy, ii) repeatability, iii) backlash, iv) speed resolution and v) microstep size. Finally, the mechatronic system is tested for the intended application using a halogen light source and a spectrometer to measure transmission through glass TCO samples through a hemisphere. The system performed as expected has a unidirectional accuracy of 2.827 degrees, repeatability of 1.585 degrees, backlash error of 1.237 degrees, maximum speed of 35.156 degrees and a verifiable microstep size of 0.33 degrees. Despite the highest mean squared errors, the open source gimbal system performed adequately while measuring transmission of radiation through glass with TCO coatings. This open source system also represents a 96% cost in savings as compared to the least expensive commercial variant. The high mean squared errors are offset by the cost of the system coupled with its open source nature that promotes further collaboration and hence, development.",,

In the fields of materials science and mechanical engineering, fundamental equipment such as tensile testing devices can cost tens to hundreds of thousands of dollars. While a research lab often has access to a large-scale testing machine suitable for conventional samples, loading devices for meso-and micro-scale samples for in-situ testing with the myriad of microscopy tools are often hard to source and cost prohibitive. Open-source software has allowed for great strides in the reduction of costs associated with software development and open-source hardware and additive manufacturing have the potential to similarly reduce the costs of scientific equipment and increase the accessibility of scientific research. To investigate the feasibility of open-source hardware, a micro-tensile tester was designed with a freely accessible computer-aided design package and manufactured with a desktop 3D-printer and off-the-shelf components. To our knowledge this is one of the first demonstrations of a tensile tester with additively manufactured components for scientific research. The capabilities of the tensile tester were demonstrated by investigating the mechanical properties of Graphene Oxide (GO) paper and thin films. A 3D printed tensile tester was successfully used in conjunction with an atomic force microscope to provide one of the first quantitative measurements of GO thin film buckling under compression. The tensile tester was also used in conjunction with an atomic force microscope to observe the change in surface topology of a GO paper in response to increasing tensile strain. No significant change in surface topology was observed in contrast to prior hypotheses from the literature. Based on this result obtained with the new open source tensile stage we propose an alternative hypothesis we term 'superlamellae consolidation' to explain the initial deformation of GO paper. The additively manufactured tensile tester tested represents cost savings of > 99% compared to commercial solutions in its class and offers simple customization. However, continued development is needed for the tensile tester presented here to approach the technical specifications achievable with commercial solutions.",,

Yet “open” research instruments have understudied socioeconomic, organizational, and political dynamics, describing distinctive modes of participation in scientific knowledge infrastructures. In this paper, I describe the CERN “Open Hardware” initiative with a focus on the exchange practices and technologies of participation that were mobilized to assemble a critical infrastructure with distributed teams at research centers, companies, and Internet-based projects. Drawing from ethnographic and archival research of collaborative and competitive dynamics around “Open Hardware” at CERN, I examine how “open” scientific tools and infrastructures are designed, disputed, and implemented following Free and Open Source development models. In questioning “openness” both at the level of technical objects and their technical collectives, I examine the usage of Open Hardware for validating and assessing research results as well as rendering scientific projects more permeable to new modes of participation in the making of the“technoscience by other means.” --- Paper submitted for the ""Colloque annuel de l’IFRIS 2018,"" Université Paris VI, France.</p>",,

A 34-year-old man presented with pain and swelling of the left leg, where he had previously sustained an open tibia fracture 1 year prior. After the initial injury, he underwent four corrective surgeries (including bone graft and internal-fixation) and was asymptomatic for 6 months before these new symptoms developed. MRI revealed a 6.5 × 5.1 × 2.7 cm abscess and tibial osteomyelitis. Surgical staff performed an aggressive incision and drainage (I&D) with saucerization of the tibia, to treat what seemed to be a routine hardware infection. Five days later, tissue cultures grew Brucella melitensis. Upon further questioning, the patient described butchering a wild boar 10 days prior to symptom onset. Methods: The CDC provides guidance on serological testing and post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) for persons exposed to Brucella in the laboratory setting. Upon identification of this patient’s Brucella isolates, infection control staff identified all laboratory workers that met CDC criteria for “high risk” exposure, as well as other healthcare workers (HCW) exposed to aerosolized infectious material (including those workers in the operating room during pulse lavage of the abscess). Results: Staff identified 34 HCW with presumed high-risk exposure, including 19 laboratory personnel, 13 operating room personnel, and two patient care technicians. Baseline serology was obtained on all 34 HCW, and PEP with rifampin and doxycycline was prescribed for each. Nine of the exposed employees changed PEP therapy due to intolerance, and follow-up serology was obtained on 32 of the 34 healthcare workers, with zero seroconversions found. Conclusion: Brucellosis is a rare disease in clinical practice, so a high index of suspicion is necessary to enact appropriate precautions before widespread exposures. When exposure is identified after the fact, efficient protocols should be in place to identify all susceptible individuals. Due to the low infectious dose of Brucella melitensis, CDC guidance should be expanded to include aerosolizing procedures outside of the laboratory.

However, due to the discreteness of low-bit quantization, existing quantization methods often face the unstable training process and severe performance degradation. To address this problem, in this paper we propose Differentiable Soft Quantization (DSQ) to bridge the gap between the full-precision and low-bit networks. DSQ can automatically evolve during training to gradually approximate the standard quantization. Owing to its differentiable property, DSQ can help pursue the accurate gradients in backward propagation, and reduce the quantization loss in forward process with an appropriate clipping range. Extensive experiments over several popular network structures show that training low-bit neural networks with DSQ can consistently outperform state-of-the-art quantization methods. Besides, our ﬁrst efﬁcient implementation for deploying 2 to 4-bit DSQ on devices with ARM architecture achieves up to 1.7× speed up, compared with the open-source 8-bit high-performance inference framework NCNN [31].",,

The basic concept of SDN is the separation of control plane (network configuration) and data plane (forwarding). The control plane is implemented by a dedicated controller running on an external host. This controller implements the control logic like route calculation and topology discovery and configures the forwarding tables of switches accordingly; the switches are responsible for packet forwarding. The control logic is implemented in software using high-level programming languages like C, C++, Java, or Python and can be easily modified (software instead of firmware). Therefore, this concept combines flexibility and ease of implementation with high forwarding performance (line rate forwarding, low latency). With OpenFlow, a first standard protocol for SDN is available that is implemented by hardware switches from several vendors already and software switches like Open vSwitch as typically used in data centers to connect virtual machines on hosts. Moreover, several open source controller implementations exist. In this lab course, we will introduce the basic principles of SDN, and students will gain practical knowledge and experience in programming software-defined networks using realistic examples. In detail, this course covers the following aspects:  Introduction to the OpenFlow standard  SDN controller concepts and interfaces using the OpenDaylight controller (Java-based implementation; REST interface, OSGI module interface)  Topology discovery and statistics (counters)  Implementation of centralized static and dynamic routing protocols  Control plane distribution for increased availability and scalability  Testing and performance evaluation using software switches (Open vSwitch), hardware switches, and network emulation (Mininet) Recommended prerequisites: Basic knowledge of computer networks and Java.

The BEAGLE library defines a simple, but flexible, application programming interface (API), and includes a collection of efficient implementations for calculation under a variety of evolutionary models on different hardware devices. The library has been integrated into recent versions of popular phylogenetics software packages including BEAST and MrBayes and has been widely used across a diverse range of evolutionary studies. Here, we present BEAGLE 3 with new parallel implementations, increased performance for challenging data sets, improved scalability, and better usability. We have added new OpenCL and central processing unit-threaded implementations to the library, allowing the effective utilization of a wider range of modern hardware. Further, we have extended the API and library to support concurrent computation of independent partial likelihood arrays, for increased performance of nucleotide-model analyses with greater flexibility of data partitioning. For better scalability and usability, we have improved how phylogenetic software packages use BEAGLE in multi-GPU (graphics processing unit) and cluster environments, and introduced an automated method to select the fastest device given the data set, evolutionary model, and hardware. For application developers who wish to integrate the library, we also have developed an online tutorial. To evaluate the effect of the improvements, we ran a variety of benchmarks on state-of-the-art hardware. For a partitioned exemplar analysis, we observe run-time performance improvements as high as 5.9-fold over our previous GPU implementation.

Our target is the NetFPGA SUME platform, a 4x10 Gb/s PCIe card designed for use in universities for teaching and research. Until now, NetFPGA users have needed to learn an HDL such as Verilog or VHDL, making it off limits to many software developers and students.

Enabling machine learning algorithms to run on resource-constrained hardware, typically on low-power smart devices, is challenging in terms of hardware (optimized and energy-efficient integrated circuits), algorithmic, and firmware implementations. This article presents a FANN-on-MCU, an open-source toolkit built upon the fast artificial neural network (FANN) library to run lightweight and energy-efficient neural networks on microcontrollers based on both the ARM Cortex-M series and the novel RISC-V-based parallel ultralow-power (PULP) platform. The toolkit takes multilayer perceptrons trained with FANN and generates code targeted to low-power microcontrollers. This article also presents detailed analyses of energy efficiency across the different cores, and the optimizations to handle different network sizes. Moreover, it provides a detailed analysis of parallel speedups and degradations due to parallelization overhead and memory transfers. Further evaluations include experimental results for three different applications using a self-sustainable wearable multisensor bracelet. The experimental results show a measured latency in the order of only a few microseconds and power consumption of a few milliwatts while keeping the memory requirements below the limitations of the targeted microcontrollers. In particular, the parallel implementation on the octa-core RISC-V platform reaches a speedup of $22\times $ and a 69% reduction in energy consumption with respect to a single-core implementation on Cortex-M4 for continuous real-time classification.",,

SCADA provides real-time data exchange between a control/monitoring centre and field devices connected to the distributed processes. A SCADA system performs these functions using its four basic elements: Field Instrumentation Devices (FIDs) such as sensors and actuators which are connected to the distributed process plants being managed, Remote Terminal Units (RTUs) such as single board computers for receiving, processing and sending the remote data from the field instrumentation devices, Master Terminal Units (MTUs) for handling data processing and human machine interactions, and lastly SCADA Communication Channels for connecting the RTUs to the MTUs, and for parsing the acquired data. Generally, there are two classes of SCADA hardware and software; Proprietary (Commercial) and Open Source. In this paper, we present the design and implementation of a low-cost, Open Source SCADA system by using Thinger.IO local server IoT platform as the MTU and ESP32 Thing micro-controller as the RTU. SCADA architectures have evolved over the years from monolithic (stand-alone) through distributed and networked architectures to the latest Internet of Things (IoT) architecture. The SCADA system proposed in this work is based on the Internet of Things SCADA architecture which incorporates web services with the conventional (traditional) SCADA for a more robust supervisory control and monitoring. It comprises of analog Current and Voltage Sensors, the low-power ESP32 Thing micro-controller, a Raspberry Pi micro-controller, and a local Wi-Fi Router. In its implementation, the current and voltage sensors acquire the desired data from the process plant, the ESP32 micro-controller receives, processes and sends the acquired sensor data via a Wi-Fi network to the Thinger.IO local server IoT platform for data storage, real-time monitoring and remote control. The Thinger.IO server is locally hosted by the Raspberry Pi micro-controller, while the Wi-Fi network which forms the SCADA communication channel is created using the Wi-Fi Router. In order to test the proposed SCADA system solution, the designed hardware was set up to remotely monitor the Photovoltaic (PV) voltage, current, and power, as well as the storage battery voltage of a 260 W, 12 V Solar PV System.

These developments call for a close inspection of what is occurring, and consideration of how it is changing and can change our relationship with music for better and for worse. This article looks at AI applied to music from two perspectives: copyright law and engineering praxis. It grounds its discussion in the development and use of a specific application of AI in music creation, which raises further and unanticipated questions. Most of the questions collected in this article are open as their answers are not yet clear at this time, but they are nonetheless important to consider as AI technologies develop and are applied more widely to music, not to mention other domains centred on human creativity.",,

The sensors provide a continuous flow of data about the environment in which they are deployed, which is received and processed to build a dynamic estimation of the situation. With current technology, it is relatively simple to deploy a set of sensors in a specific geographic area, in order to have highly sensorized spaces. However, to be able to fusion and process the information coming from the data sources of a highly sensorized space, it is necessary to solve certain problems inherent to this type of technology. The challenge is analogous to what we can find in the field of the Internet of Things (IoT). IoT technology is characterized by providing the infrastructure capacity to capture, store, and process a huge amount of heterogeneous sensor data (in most cases, from different manufacturers), in the same way that it occurs in data fusion applications. This work is not simple, mainly due to the fact that there is no standardization of the technologies involved (especially within the communication protocols used by the connectable sensors). The solutions that we can find today are proprietary solutions that imply an important dependence and a high cost. The aim of this paper is to present a new open source platform with capabilities for the collection, management and analysis of a huge amount of heterogeneous sensor data. In addition, this platform allows the use of hardware-agnostic in a highly scalable and cost-effective manner. This platform is called Thinger.io. One of the main characteristics of Thinger.io is the ability to model sensorized environments through a high level language that allows a simple and easy implementation of data fusion applications, as we will show in this paper.",,

However, affordable tools are often constrained to short-term studies due to high energy consumption and limited storage. To enable long-term monitoring, energy and space efficiency must be improved on such tools. This paper describes the development and deployment of three acoustic detection algorithms that reduce the power and storage requirements of acoustic monitoring on affordable, open-source hardware. The algorithms aim to detect bat echolocation, to search for evidence of an endangered cicada species, and also to collect evidence of poaching in a protected nature reserve. The algorithms are designed to run on AudioMoth: a low-cost, open-source acoustic monitoring device, developed by the authors and widely adopted by the conservation community. Each algorithm addresses a detection task of increasing complexity, implementing extra analytical steps to account for environmental conditions such as wind, analysing samples multiple times to prevent missed events, and incorporating a hidden Markov model for sample classification in both the time and frequency domain. For each algorithm, we report on real-world deployments carried out with partner organisations and also benchmark the hidden Markov model against a convolutional neural network, a deep-learning technique commonly used for acoustics. The deployments demonstrate how acoustic detection algorithms extend the use of low-cost, open-source hardware and facilitate a new avenue for conservation researchers to perform large-scale monitoring.",,

However, UWB researchers are currently limited by the small amount of feasible open source hardware that is publicly available. We developed a new open source hardware platform, Wi-PoS, for precise UWB localization based on Decawave’s DW1000 UWB transceiver with several unique features: support of both long-range sub-GHz and 2.4 GHz back-end communication between nodes, flexible interfacing with external UWB antennas, and an easy implementation of the MAC layer with the Time-Annotated Instruction Set Computer (TAISC) framework. Both hardware and software are open source and all parameters of the UWB ranging can be adjusted, calibrated, and analyzed. This paper explains the main specifications of the hardware platform, illustrates design decisions, and evaluates the performance of the board in terms of range, accuracy, and energy consumption. The accuracy of the ranging system was below 10 cm in an indoor lab environment at distances up to 5 m, and accuracy smaller than 5 cm was obtained at 50 and 75 m in an outdoor environment. A theoretical model was derived for predicting the path loss and the influence of the most important ground reflection. At the same time, the average energy consumption of the hardware was very low with only 81 mA for a tag node and 63 mA for the active anchor nodes, permitting the system to run for several days on a mobile battery pack and allowing easy and fast deployment on sites without an accessible power supply or backbone network.

Several works have demonstrated that this trade-off can improve the accuracy of applications. However, the variable-length exponent and significand encoding impacts the hardware cost of posit arithmetic. The objective of the present work is to enable application-level evaluations of the posit system that include performance and resource consumption. To this purpose, this article introduces an open-source hardware implementation of the posit number system, in the form of a C++ templatized library compatible with Vivado HLS. This library currently implements addition, subtraction and multiplication for custom-size posits. In addition, the posit standard also mandates the presence of the ""quire"", a large accumulator able to perform exact sums of products. The proposed library includes the first open-source parameterized hardware quire. This library is shown to improve the state-of-the-art of posit implementations in terms of latency and resource consumption. Still, standard 32 bits posit adders and multipliers are found to be much larger and slower than the corresponding floating-point operators.

Consequently, many algorithms have been developed to minimize the number of I/O operations for common computing patterns. Matrix multiplication is no exception, and lower bounds have been proven and implemented both for shared and distributed memory systems. Reconfigurable hardware platforms are a lucrative target for I/O minimizing algorithms, as they offer full control of memory accesses to the programmer. While bounds developed in the context of fixed architectures still apply to these platforms, the spatially distributed nature of their computational and memory resources requires a decentralized approach to optimize algorithms for maximum hardware utilization. We present a model to optimize matrix multiplication for FPGA platforms, simultaneously targeting maximum performance and minimum off-chip data movement, within constraints set by the hardware. We map the model to a concrete architecture using a high-level synthesis tool, maintaining a high level of abstraction, allowing us to support arbitrary data types, and enables maintainability and portability across FPGA devices. Kernels generated from our architecture are shown to offer competitive performance in practice, scaling with both compute and memory resources.

However, it is not an easy task to compare the cores to one another, as they employ different interconnects, build systems and so on. This work presents an open-source catalog of RISC-V cores for use on FPGAs. All of these cores have been wrapped as drop-in compatible processing elements and can be used either standalone, or integrated into the TaPaSCo SoC composition framework. By using TaPaSCo, details of the bitstream generation flow and user-space interfaces are abstracted away, allowing the user to focus on the needs of the concrete applications when exploring the RISC-V landscape. All of the catalog's cores have been synthesized for a number of hardware platforms, and are evaluated against each other using state-of-the-art embedded processor benchmarks such as Dhrystone, Embench and CoreMark. The results show that the cores have a huge degree in performance variability. The slowest cores achieve less than 100MHz on large UltraScale+ devices, while better FPGA-optimized cores run in excess of 500 MHz. Accordingly, the benchmarks show a wide spread of performance ranging from less than 0.5 CoreMark/MHz up to over 2.5 CoreMark/MHz.",,

Common approaches for measuring liquid intake in real time include computer-tethered lickometers or video-based systems. Additionally, liquids can be measured or weighed to determine the amount consumed without real-time sensing. Here, we built a photobeam-based sipper device that has the following advantages over traditional methods: (1) it is battery powered and fits in vivarium caging to allow home-measurements; (2) it quantifies the intake of two different liquids simultaneously for preference studies; (3) it is low cost and easily constructed, enabling high-throughput experiments; and (4) it is open source so that others can modify it to fit their experimental needs. We validated the performance of this device in three experiments. First, we calibrated our device using time-lapse video-based measurements of liquid intake and correlated sipper interactions with liquid intake. Second, we used the sipper device to measure preference for water versus chocolate milk, demonstrating its utility for two-bottle choice tasks. Third, we integrated the device with fiber photometry, establishing its utility for measuring neural activity in studies of ingestive behavior. This device requires no special equipment or caging, and is small, battery powered, and wireless, allowing it to be placed directly in rodent home cages. The total cost of fabrication is less than $100, and all design files and code are open source.

These applications need new intelligent devices along heterogeneous networking. Which makes them costly to implement indeed. Platforms and open devices designed for open-source hardware are possible solutions. This research was conducted under an IoT design, implementation, and assessment model for the remote monitoring of pulse oximetry via oxygen partial saturation (SpO2) and heart rate (HR) with low-energy consumption. Methods This study focused on the development of SpO2 and HR measurements that will allow the monitoring and estimation in real time of the user's state and health related to the established parameters. Measurements were acquired and recorded using a remote web server that recorded the acquired variables for further processing. The statistical analysis data allows comparison of the registered data measured with theoretical models.

However, using DNN-based approaches can easily introduce huge demands of computation and memory consumption, which may not be feasible for direct deployment onto the Internet of Thing (IoT) devices, since they have strict constraints on hardware resources, power budgets, response latency, and manufacturing cost. To bring DNNs into IoT devices, embedded FPGA can be one of the most suitable candidates by providing better energy efficiency than GPU and CPU based solutions, and higher flexibility than ASICs. In this paper, we propose a systematic solution to deploy DNNs on embedded FPGAs, which includes a ternarized hardware Deep Learning Accelerator (T-DLA), and a framework for ternary neural network (TNN) training. T-DLA is a highly optimized hardware unit in FPGA specializing in accelerating the TNNs, while the proposed framework can significantly compress the DNN parameters down to two bits with little accuracy drop. Results show that our training framework can compress the DNN up to 14.14x while maintaining nearly the same accuracy compared to the floating point version. By illustrating our proposed design techniques, the T-DLA can deliver up to 0.4TOPS with 2.576W power consumption, showing 873.6x and 5.1x higher energy efficiency (fps/W) on ImageNet with Resnet-18 model comparing to Xeon E5-2630 CPU and Nvidia 1080 Ti GPU.

To assess the potential of autonomous low-cost UAVs for the mapping and monitoring of alpine glaciers, we conducted multiple aerial surveys on the Kanderfirn in the Swiss Alps in 2017 and 2018 using open hardware and software of the Paparazzi UAV project. The open-source photogrammetry software OpenDroneMap was tested for the generation of high-resolution orthophotos and digital surface models (DSMs) from aerial imagery and cross-checked with the well-established proprietary software Pix4D. Accurately measured ground control points served for the determination of the geometric accuracy of the orthophotos and DSMs. A horizontal (xy) accuracy of 0.7-1.2 m and a vertical (z) accuracy of 0.7-2.1 m was achieved for OpenDroneMap, compared to a xy-accuracy of 0.3-0.5 m and a z-accuracy of 0.4-0.5 m obtained for Pix4D. Based on the analysis and comparison of different orthophotos and DSMs, surface elevation, roughness and brightness changes from 3 June to 29 September 2018 were quantified. While the brightness of the glacier surface decreased linearly over the ablation season, the surface roughness increased. The mean DSM-based elevation change across the glacier tongue was 8 m, overestimating the measured melting and surface lowering at the installed ablation stakes by about 1.5 m. The presented results highlight that self-built fixed-wing UAVs in tandem with open-source photogrammetry software are an affordable alternative to commercial remote-sensing platforms and proprietary software.

Parametric design using a solid modeling programming language allows customization and provides a source file for the design. OpenSCAD is the most widely used scripting tool for parametric modeling of open source labware. However, OpenSCAD lacks the ability to export to standard parametric formats; thus, the parametric dimensional information of the model is lost. This is an important deficiency because it is key to share the design in the most accessible formats with no information loss. In this work we analyze OpenSCAD and compare it with FreeCAD Python scripts. We have created a parametric open source hardware design to compare these tools. Our findings show that although Python for FreeCAD is more arduous to learn, its advantages counterbalance the initial difficulties. The main benefits are being able to export to standard parametric models; using Python language with its libraries; and the ability to use and integrate the models in its graphical interface.

Notably, many open research questions regarding the extraction of functionally correct netlists from Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) or Application Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs) have been tackled. In order to facilitate further analysis of recovered netlists, a software framework is required, serving as the foundation for specialized algorithms.

Given fundamental power requirements for such communication, burdened mass guidelines and battery technology, this constraint necessitates the continued use of very high frequency (VHF) radio beacons. As such, efforts should be made to mitigate their primary deficiencies: detection range, localization time and localization accuracy. The integration of a radiotelemetry system with an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) could significantly improve the capacity for data collection from VHF tags. We present a UAV-integrated radiotelemetry system that relies on open source hardware and software. Localization methods, including signal processing, bearing estimation based on principal component analysis, localization techniques and test results, are discussed. Using a low-power beacon applicable for bats and small birds, testing showed that the improved vantage of the UAV-radiotelemetry system (UAV-RT) provided significantly higher received signal power compared to the low-level flights (maximum range beyond 1.4 km). Flight testing of localization methods showed median bearing errors between 2.3 degrees and 6.8 degrees, with localization errors of between 5% and 14% of the distance to the tag. In a direct comparison to an experienced radiotelemetry user, the UAV-RT system provided bearing and localization estimates with 53% less error. This paper introduces the core functionality and use methods of the UAV-RT system, while presenting baseline localization performance metrics. An associated website hosts plans for assembly and software installation. The methods of UAV-RT use for tag detection will be further developed in future works. For both the detection and localization problems, the mobility of a flying asset drastically reduces tracker time requirements. A 7-min flight would be sufficient to collect five equally spaced bearing estimates over a 1-km transect. The use of a software-defined radio on the UAV-RT system will allow for the simultaneous detection and localization of multiple tags.",,

However, they suffer from some design issues related to the difficulty to implement them on different hardware platforms without additional efforts. To bridge this gap, recently, the IEEE Computational Intelligence Society has sponsored the publication of the standard IEEE Std 1855-2016 which is aimed at providing the fuzzy community with a well-defined approach to model FRBSs in a hardware-independent way. In order to provide a runnable version of an FRBS that is designed in accordance with the IEEE Std 1855-2016, the open source library Java Fuzzy Markup Language (JFML) has been developed. However, due to hardware and/or software limitations of embedded systems, it is not always possible to run an IEEE Std 1855-2016 FRBS on this kind of systems. The aim of this paper is to overcome this drawback by developing a new JFML module that assists developers in the design and implementation of FRBSs for open hardware-embedded systems. In detail, the module supports several connection types (WiFi, Bluetooth, and USB) in order to make feasible running FRBSs in a remote computer when, due to hardware limitations, it is not possible that they run locally in the embedded systems. The new JFML module is ready for ArduinoTM and Raspberry Pi, but it can be easily extended to other hardware architectures. Moreover, the new JFML module allows to automatically generate runnable files on Arduino(TM) or Raspberry Pi in order to support nonexpert users, that is, users without specific knowledge about embedded systems or without strong programming skills. The use of the new JFML module is illustrated in two case studies. (c) 2019 The Authors. Published by Atlantis Press SARL.",,

Open source technology has enormous potential to spur innovation and enhance technological literacy and thus contribute to socioeconomic and ecological sustainability. Like in software, open source hardware (OSH) projects and online communities have evolved in a broad range of technologies and applications. In these communities, people from all over the world with diverse backgrounds (students, researchers, consumers, users etc.) gather online to jointly develop, revise, improve and freely share hardware designs and documentation. Additionally, people may build, adapt, use and sell physical artefacts based on these designs in accordance with the notion of open source. The (potential) economic impact and value of open source hardware is hard to quantify as contributors usually do not get paid and users do not necessarily buy products from vendors. Nonetheless, value is created as in the case of Linux or Wikipedia. We applied established valuation methods for open source hardware to quantify cost savings and as a result the value of an open source magnetic resonance imaging device (MRI) currently under development by the Open Source Imaging Initiative (OSI2). Depending on the scenario and the valuation method, we found that savings for healthcare systems from US$1.8 million up to US$222 million per year are possible in the near future making the case for public funding and private investment in open source technology development.",,

The EyeTrackers and Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs) are suitable systems for those people but their main drawback is their cost. More affordable devices are capable of detecting voluntary blinks and translating them into a binary signal that allows the selection, for example, of an ideogram on a communication board. We tested four different systems based on infrared, bioelectrical signals (Electro-Oculography (EOG) and Electro-Encephalography (EEG)), and video processing. The experiments were performed by people with/without disabilities and analyzed the systems' performances, usability, and method of voluntary blinking (long blinks or sequence of two short blinks). The best accuracy (99.3%) was obtained using Infrared-Oculography (IR-OG) and the worst with the EEG headset (85.9%) and there was a statistical influence of the technology on accuracy. Regarding the method of voluntary blinking, the use of long or double blinks had no statistical influence on accuracy, excluding EOG, and the time taken to perform double blinks was shorter, resulting in a potentially much faster interface. People with disabilities obtained similar values but with greater variability. The preferred technology and blinking methods were Video-Oculography (VOG) and long blinks, respectively. The several Open-Source Hardware (MEW) devices have been developed and a new algorithm for detecting voluntary blinks has also been proposed, which outperforms most of the published papers in the reviewed literature.",,

The horizontal-to-vertical spectral ratio technique calculates the resonant frequency of the soil just by using a single three-component sensor. Array measurements require at least several vertical sensors registering simultaneously and their analysis provides an estimation of the surface waves dispersion curve. Although these methods are relatively cheaper than other geotechnical techniques, the cost of the sensors and the multi-channel data acquisition system means that small research groups cannot afford this kind of equipment. In this work, two prototypes for registering seismic noise have been developed and implemented: a three-channel acquisition system, optimized for working with three-component sensors; and a twelve-channel acquisition system, prepared for working simultaneously with twelve vertical geophones. Both prototypes are characterized by being open-hardware, open-software, easy to implement, and low-cost.

This prototype device employs 18 unique angular measurement positions and a variety of user-selectable LED light sources. The motivation for this project was the need to generate more parameter-rich data sets pertaining to the light-scattering properties of natural sediment suspensions, and to address the issues raised by Kitchener et al. (2017) concerning the inconsistent calibration methodologies currently employed to quantify suspended sediment concentration (SSC) by optical turbidity measurement. The mechanical design comprises re-purposed waste plastic materials and 3D-printed parts. The active light-source control and monitoring hardware and firmware executes on the open-source Arduino embedded microcontroller platform. The modular light sensors plug into any of the angular measurement positions, providing a 0-5 V nominal output signal, which is readable by the user's choice of data-acquisition system. The device will facilitate the highly detailed characterization of suspended sediment samples, providing 18 voltage output channels for analysis by the user. The precise calibration of the light sensors is by the use of neutral density (ND) filters in conjunction with light-source electrical current measurements, providing light-source intensity values as required. The empirical data provided by existing turbidity meters are acquired using incommensurate methodologies, and therefore they are not cross-comparable.

Here, we present 'OpenDropOff', an open-source, low-cost electronic drop-off unit for remotely detaching animal-borne sensors from individuals. OpenDropOff devices function by using heat, produced by running an electrical current through resistance wire (nichrome), to melt nylon (e.g. fishing) line, detaching sensors from animals at or after a pre-determined time. OpenDropOff can be constructed using commercially available components (costing < USD $15 in total; approximately 10% or less of many commercially available drop-off units) and can be customized to fit project- and species-specific needs.

We have developed a third version of this infrastructure, AICARP.V3, which addresses several problems detected in the data acquisition stage of the second version, (i.e., intrusion of the pulse sensor, poor resolution and lowsignal to noise ratio in the galvanic skin response sensor and slow response time of the temperature sensor) and extends the capabilities to integrate new actuators.

Retrieving these data and storing them can be challenging. Present options include proprietary commercial dataloggers, communication devices, and protocols with rigid software and data structures that may require ongoing expenses. While there are open-source solutions that include telemetry, such as EnviroDIY's Mayfly, none presently generate real-time, remotely accessible workbooks (Aufdenkampe et al., 2017; EnviroDIY, 2018). The Openly Published Environmental Sensing (OPEnS) Lab developed the OPEnS Hub, a new approach to using low-power, open-source hardware and software to achieve real-time data logging from the field to the web. The Hub is an order of magnitude less expensive than commercial products, inherently modular and flexible, and aims to reduce technical barriers for users with little programming experience (DeBell, 2019). Data can be collected remotely using a host of transmission protocols to relay data from distributed in situ monitoring devices. The Hub mesh-networks with several nodes and backs up to an onboard microSD card. Telemetry options include 900 MHz Long Range Radio (LoRa) with up to 25 km range and Nordic Radio Frequency (nRF) for higher data rates (Feather, 2018). Ongoing transmissions from the Hub to the internet currently employ Ethernet with potential support for Wi-Fi and the cell network. The Hub engages a dynamic, low-latency portal to Google Sheets via the free Application Programming Interface (API), PushingBox, and an adaptable Google Apps Script. This framework was tested on 12 individual sensors nodes at remote sites in Oregon. This manuscript details our methods and evaluates PushingBox, Google Apps Script, Adafruit Industries' open-hardware Feather development boards, the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP), and the aforementioned modes of data transfer.",,

It was shown that electrically stimulating the brain can be used to produce simple visual impressions of light blobs (phosphenes). This technology, using electrodes placed on top of the visual cortex, was successfully used to give blind people some degree of visual impression of their surrounding. However, this perception is very far away from natural sight. For developing the next generation of visual prostheses, real-time closed-loop stimulators are required. Such a stimulator measures the actual neuronal activities and on this basis determines the required stimulation pattern. In addition, there is a desire to shrink the diameter of the applied electrodes and increase their spatial density. This leads to the challenge of designing a system that can produce arbitrary stimulation-patterns with up to +/- 70 V and with up to 25 mA while measuring neuronal signals with amplitudes in the order of mV. Furthermore, interruptions of the measurements during stimulation should be as short as possible and the system needs to scale to hundreds of electrodes. We discuss how such a system and especially its current pumps and input protection need to be designed and which problems arise. We condense our findings into an example design for which we provide all design files (boards, firmwares and software) as open-source. This is a first step in taking the existing open-sourcewww.open-ephys.org recording system and converting it into a closed-loop experimental setup for neuro-prosthetic research. (C) 2019 The Authors.

In this work, we aimed to image scanned proton beams with greater flexibility than is provided by previous systems by using an innovative camera triggering solution. The main objective was to synchronize image acquisitions with proton beam deliveries. A 3D detector composed of 3 scientific complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor cameras and a volumetric liquid scintillator (20 x20x 20 cm) were used. We identified relevant signals from the synchrotron beam delivery system to trigger the cameras. These signals were processed using an open hardware microcontroller and monitored using an oscilloscope. We evaluated the camera triggering scheme by comparing the mean signal intensity and standard deviations for triggered versus non-triggered image acquisitions at 5 energies (161.6, 140.9, 124.0, 100.9, and 85.6 MeV) with 50 spots per energy. The performance of the triggering scheme was further investigated by testing the image intensity variability for 5 energies delivered at 9 different location (2 spots/location). We also measured the background signals for different exposure times (1-1000 ms) using both triggered and non-triggered schemes. The mean signal intensity difference between triggered and non-triggered schemes was 10% +/- 0.4% for low SNR (similar to 20 dB). The image intensity variability was within 2%. The background signal intensity varied by only 0.6% from the shortest exposure time (1 ms) to the longest (1 s). We demonstrated a flexible triggering scheme using an open hardware microcontroller with a camera and scintillator detector system for a spot scanning proton beam, which will enable efficient machine quality assurance and treatment plan verification measurements in the future.",,

The total construction cost for this rover is less than USD 3000, approximately one-tenth the cost of existing platforms, and it can be built using facilities frequently available at academic institutions (machine shop, 3-D printer, open-source hardware and software). Instrumentation deployed on this rover can be customized; the rover presented in this study was equipped with a dual-frequency GPS receiver and a digital SLR camera for constructing digital elevation models using structure-from-motion (SfM) photogrammetry. We deployed this prototype rover on the Northeast Greenland Ice Stream to map local variations in snow accumulation and surface topography. The rover conducted four autonomous missions based out of the East Greenland Ice-Core Project (EastGRIP) camp during July 2017, measuring surface elevation transects across the hazardous ice-stream shear margins. During these missions, the rover proved capable of driving over 20 km on a single charge with a drawbar pull of 250 N, sufficient to tow instrumentation of up to 100 kg. The rover also acquired photographs that were subsequently used to construct digital elevation models of a site monitored for spatiotemporal variability in snow accumulation, demonstrating adequate stability for high-resolution imaging applications. Due to its low cost, low-power requirements, and simple modular design, mass deployments of this rover design are practicable. Operation of the rover in hazardous areas circumvents the substantial expense and risk to personnel associated with conventional, crewed deployments. Thus, this rover is an investigatory plat-form that enables direct exploration of polar environments considered too hazardous for conventional field expeditions.",,

Therefore, it is not surprising that apartment energy consumption and ways to save energy in housing are a popular research topic in Finland. In this paper, two different research areas are introduced: First, a literature survey is presented on the research subjects of energy saving in the area of real estate and housing. The goal is to gain overall knowledge of the current state of energy saving research. The overall conclusion is that knowledge of energy consumption improves efforts toward energy saving. Second, rapid prototyping with off-the-shelf devices and open source software are described. These devices are cheap to install, and a wide range of sensors are available. Consequently, it is important to deal with these topics together.

Furthermore, an ultimate control is developed for the desired attitude-tracking performance. Various uncertainties, including torque due to the discordance between the centre of mass and rotation and wind disturbances are considered. The Lyapunov stability theorem is then applied step-by-step to prove the asymptotically stable and finite-time convergence in position and attitude controllers.

OpenPiton is the world's first open source, general-purpose, multithreaded manycore processor, and framework. OpenPiton is highly configurable, providing a rich design space spanning a variety of hardware parameters that researchers can change. OpenPiton designs can be emulated on FPGA5, where they can run full-stack multiuser Debian Linux. OpenPiton is designed to scale to very large core fabrics, enabling researchers to measure operating system, compiler, and software scalability. The mature code-base reflects the complexity of an industrial-grade design and provides the necessary scripts to build new chips, making OpenPiton a natural choice for computer-aided design (CAD) research. OpenPiton has been validated with a 25-core chip prototype, named Piton, and is bolstered by a validation suite that has thousands of tests, providing an environment to test new hardware designs while verifying the correctness of the whole system. OpenPiton is being actively used in research both internally to Princeton and in the wider community, as well as being adopted in education, industry, and government settings.",,

Most systems available to the public have price tags in the thousands of dollars and their dimensions cannot be easily customized. Current systems have a maximum length of about ten meters, and for a typical greenhouse application that length may not be sufficient. The price of the system increases with an increase in length, and with a base price in the thousands of dollars it becomes impractical to buy a system for such application. Our HyperRail is a modular linear motion system with a repeatability of 2 mm and current top speed of 200 mm/s. This is possible through a stepper motor driver that allows for 1/16th microstepping giving an average of 6180 steps per revolution. An advantage that this system has is its ability to increase or decrease the length of system with minimum effort and only nominal increase in price. The HyperRail can be mounted on a set of tripods or directly on the structure of a building such as a greenhouse. The base price for a three-meter system, on tripods is US$278 and only US$45 for each additional 1.5 m of length. (C) 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.",,

However, the existing tools to mix multiple light sources in one-photon microscopy are limited. Here, we present the development of several microcontroller devices that provide temporal and intensity control of light emitting diodes (LEDs) for computer controlled microscopy illumination. We interfaced one microcontroller with mu Manager for rapid and dynamic overlay of transmitted and fluorescent images. Moreover, on the basis of this illumination system we implemented an electronic circuit to combine two pulsed LED light sources for fast (up to 1 kHz) ratiometric calcium (Ca2+) imaging. This microcontroller enabled the calibration of intracellular Ca2+ concentration and furthermore the combination of Ca2+ imaging with optogenetic activation. The devices are based on affordable components and open-source hardware and software. Integration into existing bright-field microscope systems will take similar to 1 day. The microcontroller based LED imaging substantially advances conventional illumination methods by limiting light exposure and adding versatility and speed.",,

There are several types of anemometers, with medium and high costs, such as cup, hot wire and pitot tubes, the hot wire being more sensitive and expensive than others. The device developed in this work is the cup anemometer, that is easy to build. The great advantage of this device is the low cost, with an approximate value of US$ 50.00, using simple materials that are easy to find in commercial stores. The Reed Switch sensor is also another advantage as it does not require a sophisticated programming, as well as the open platform Arduino. The use of theoretical aerodynamic drag coefficients and the presented calculations resulted in values very close to a commercial anemometer. The coefficient of determination between the cup Anemometer and the standard sensor of Meteorological Research Institute IPMet/Brazil is R-2=0.9999, indicating strong correlation between the instruments.

Our experiments show that the 8-bit fixed-point Tiny-Yolo-v2 have significantly reduce the hardware consumption with only 0.3% loss in accuracy.

A promising technology for the safe and efficient collection of monitoring data is a compact autonomous surface vehicle (ASV), capable of autonomous navigation along a predefined trajectory based on geographic coordinates and measurements in different places and depths. In this practical paper, the development process, technical details and functional testing results of a low-cost ASV for WSP monitoring are presented. Commonly available construction materials and electronic components were used to ensure affordability and reparability. The access to online tutorials and peer-support was crucial for assembling the open-source autopilot and data logger. The ASV demonstrated satisfactory performance for both the autonomous navigation as well as the georeferenced data logging of measurements at a real-scale WSP in Paraguay.

Although specifically designed for active textiles, the characterization device is broadly applicable for studying the performance of actuators including but not limited to Shape Memory Alloy (SMA) wires, SMA springs, and electroactive polymers. The characterization device may be operated in several modes that enable a wide variety of experimental protocols to be automated. These modes include but are not limited to automatic displacement and displacement rate mode, automatic force mode, and manual displacement mode. For active textiles that actuate by electrical stimulus or by resistive heating, the electronic system has five independent motor drivers. For each driver, the voltage drop across its outputs and current are measured, enabling the measurement of textile power consumption and other electrical properties. The validation of the Active Textile Characterization Device uses a contractile SMA knitted textile actuated by four motor drivers through resistive heating. Several protocols were successfully conducted to demonstrate the experimental flexibility of the system. During these experiments, knit length, knit tension, current through the knit, voltage drop across the knit, and room temperature were measured with respect to time. (C) 2019 The Authors.

The recent advances in hardware and information technology have accelerated the deployment of billions of interconnected, smart and adaptive devices in critical infrastructures like health, transportation, environmental control, and home automation. Transferring data over a network without requiring any kind of human-to-computer or human-to-human interaction, brings reliability and convenience to consumers, but also opens a new world of opportunity for intruders, and introduces a whole set of unique and complicated questions to the field of Digital Forensics. Although IoT data could be a rich source of evidence, forensics professionals cope with diverse problems, starting from the huge variety of IoT devices and non-standard formats, to the multi-tenant cloud infrastructure and the resulting multi-jurisdictional litigations. A further challenge is the end-to-end encryption which represents a trade-off between users’ right to privacy and the success of the forensics investigation. Due to its volatile nature, digital evidence has to be acquired and analyzed using validated tools and techniques that ensure the maintenance of the Chain of Custody. Therefore, the purpose of this paper is to identify and discuss the main issues involved in the complex process of IoT-based investigations, particularly all legal, privacy and cloud security challenges. Furthermore, this work provides an overview of the past and current theoretical models in the digital forensics science. Special attention is paid to frameworks that aim to extract data in a privacy-preserving manner or secure the evidence integrity using decentralized blockchain-based solutions. In addition, the present paper addresses the ongoing Forensics-as-a-Service (FaaS) paradigm, as well as some promising cross-cutting data reduction and forensics intelligence techniques.

Thus, this protection becomes crucial with a typical Internet-of-Things (IoT) setup, as it usually involves several IoT-based data sources interacting with the physical world within various application domains, such as agriculture, health care, home automation, critical industrial processes, etc. Unfortunately, contemporary IoT devices often offer very limited security features, laying themselves open to always new and more sophisticated attacks and also inhibiting the expected global adoption of IoT technologies, not to mention millions of IoT devices already deployed without any hardware security support. In this context, it is crucial to develop tools able to detect such cyber threats. In this article, we present Passban, an intelligent intrusion detection system (IDS) able to protect the IoT devices that are directly connected to it. The peculiarity of the proposed solution is that it can be deployed directly on very cheap IoT gateways (e.g., single-board PCs currently costing few tens of U.S. dollars), hence taking full advantage of the edge computing paradigm to detect cyber threats as close as possible to the corresponding data sources. We will demonstrate that Passban is able to detect various types of malicious traffic, including Port Scanning, HTTP and SSH Brute Force, and SYN Flood attacks with very low false positive rates and satisfactory accuracies.",,

Existing mNGS data analysis tools typically require bioinformatics expertise and access to local server-class hardware resources. For many research laboratories, this presents an obstacle, especially in resource limited environments. Findings We present IDseq, an open source cloud-based metagenomics pipeline and service for global pathogen detection and monitoring (https://idseq.net). The IDseq Portal accepts raw mNGS data, performs host and quality filtration steps, then executes an assembly-based alignment pipeline which results in the assignment of reads and contigs to taxonomic categories. The taxonomic relative abundances are reported and visualized in an easy-to-use web application to facilitate data interpretation and hypothesis generation. Furthermore, IDseq supports environmental background model generation and automatic internal spike-in control recognition, providing statistics which are critical for data interpretation. IDseq was designed with the specific intent of detecting novel pathogens. Here, we benchmark novel virus detection capability using both synthetically evolved viral sequences, and real-world samples, including IDseq analysis of a nasopharyngeal swab sample acquired and processed locally in Cambodia from a tourist from Wuhan, China, infected with the recently emergent SARS-CoV-2. Conclusion The IDseq Portal reduces the barrier to entry for mNGS data analysis and enables bench scientists, clinicians, and bioinformaticians to gain insight from mNGS datasets for both known and novel pathogens.",,

This likely contributes to limited translational impact. A major bottleneck for the adoption of socially complex, ethology-rich, preclinical procedures are the technical limitations for consistently annotating detailed behavioral repertoires of rodent social behavior. Manual annotation is subjective, prone to observer drift, and extremely time-intensive. Commercial approaches are expensive and inferior to manual annotation. Open-source alternatives often require significant investments in specialized hardware and significant computational and programming knowledge. By combining recent computational advances in convolutional neural networks and pose-estimation with further machine learning analysis, complex rodent social behavior is primed for inclusion under the umbrella of computational neuroethology. Here we present an open-source package with graphical interface and workflow (Simple Behavioral Analysis, SimBA) that uses pose-estimation to create supervised machine learning predictive classifiers of rodent social behavior, with millisecond resolution and accuracies that can out-perform human observers. SimBA does not require specialized video acquisition hardware nor extensive computational background. Standard descriptive statistical analysis, along with graphical region of interest annotation, are provided in addition to predictive classifier generation. To increase ease-of-use for behavioural neuroscientists, we designed SimBA with accessible menus for pre-processing videos, annotating behavioural training datasets, selecting advanced machine learning options, robust classifier validation functions and flexible visualizations tools. This allows for predictive classifier transparency, explainability and tunability prior to, and during, experimental use. We demonstrate that this approach is flexible and robust in both mice and rats by classifying social behaviors that are commonly central to the study of brain function and social motivation. Finally, we provide a library of poseestimation weights and behavioral predictive classifiers for resident-intruder behaviors in mice and rats. All code and data, together with detailed tutorials and documentation, are available on the SimBA GitHub repository. Graphical abstract SimBA graphical interface (GUI) for creating supervised machine learning classifiers of rodent social behavior. (a) Pre-process videos. SimBA supports common video pre-processing functions (e.g., cropping, clipping, sampling, format conversion, etc.) that can be performed either on single videos, or as a batch. (b) Managing poseestimation data and creating classification projects. Pose-estimation tracking projects in DeepLabCut and DeepPoseKit can be either imported or created and managed within the SimBA graphical user interface, and the tracking results are imported into SimBA classification projects. SimBA also supports userdrawn region-of-interests (ROIs) for descriptive statistics of animal movements, or as features in machine learning classification projects. (c) Create classifiers, perform classifications, and analyze classification data. SimBA has graphical tools for correcting poseestimation tracking inaccuracies when multiple subjects are within a single frame, annotating behavioral events from videos, and optimizing machine learning hyperparameters and discrimination thresholds. A number of validation checkpoints and logs are included for increased classifier explainability and tunability prior to, and during, experimental use. Both detailed and summary data are provided at the end of classifier analysis. SimBA accepts behavioral annotations generated elsewhere (such as through JWatcher) that can be imported into SimBA classification projects. (d) Visualize classification results. SimBA has several options for visualizing machine learning classifications, animal movements and ROI data, and analyzing the durations and frequencies of classified behaviors.

Fortunately, with the recent development and widespread deployment of small-scale manufacturing technologies like RepRap-class 3-D printers and open source microcontrollers, mass distributed manufacturing of ventilators has the potential to overcome medical supply shortages. In this study, after providing a background on ventilators, the academic literature is reviewed to find the existing and already openly-published, vetted designs for ventilators systems. These articles are analyzed to determine if the designs are open source both in spirit (license) as well as practical details (e.g. possessing accessible design source files, bill of materials, assembly instructions, wiring diagrams, firmware and software as well as operation and calibration instructions). Next, the existing Internet and gray literature are reviewed for open source ventilator projects and designs. The results of this review found that the tested and peer-reviewed systems lacked complete documentation and the open systems that were documented were either at the very early stages of design (sometimes without even a prototype) and were essentially only basically tested (if at all). With the considerably larger motivation of an ongoing pandemic, it is assumed these projects will garner greater attention and resources to make significant progress to reach a functional and easily-replicated system. There is a large amount of future work needed to move open source ventilators up to the level considered scientific-grade equipment, and even further work needed to reach medical-grade hardware. Future work is needed to achieve the potential of this approach by developing policies, updating regulations, and securing funding mechanisms for the development and testing of open source ventilators for both the current COVID19 pandemic as well as for future pandemics and for everyday use in low-resource settings.",,

Parallelizing SymmSpMV on today’s multicore platforms with up to 100 cores is difficult due to the need to manage conflicting updates on the result vector. Coloring approaches can be used to solve this problem without data duplication, but existing coloring algorithms do not take load balancing and deep memory hierarchies into account, hampering scalability and full-chip performance. In this work, we propose the recursive algebraic coloring engine (RACE), a novel coloring algorithm and open-source library implementation that eliminates the shortcomings of previous coloring methods in terms of hardware efficiency and parallelization overhead. We describe the level construction, distance-k coloring, and load balancing steps in RACE, use it to parallelize SymmSpMV, and compare its performance on 31 sparse matrices with other state-of-the-art coloring techniques and Intel MKL on two modern multicore processors. RACE outperforms all other approaches substantially. By means of a parameterized roofline model, we analyze the SymmSpMV performance in detail and discuss outliers. While we focus on SymmSpMV in this article, our algorithm and software are applicable to any sparse matrix operation with data dependencies that can be resolved by distance-k coloring.",,

However, existing neural networks that use 32 bits to encode each weight and activation often have an energy budget that far exceeds the capabilities of mobile or embedded devices. One common way to improve computational efficiency is to reduce the precision of the network to 16-bit or 8-bit, also known as quantization. Binarized Neural Networks (BNNs) represent an extreme case of quantized networks, that cannot be viewed as approximations to real-valued networks and therefore requires special tools and optimization strategies (Helwegen et al., 2019). In these networks both weights and activations are restricted to {−1,+1} (Hubara, Courbariaux, Soudry, El-Yaniv, & Bengio, 2016). Compared to an equivalent 8-bit quantized network BNNs require 8 times smaller memory size and 8 times fewer memory accesses, which reduces energy consumption drastically when deployed on optimized hardware (Hubara et al., 2016). However, many open research questions remain until the use of BNNs and other extremely quantized neural networks becomes widespread in industry. larq is an ecosystem of Python packages for BNNs and other Quantized Neural Networks (QNNs).

Because changes in the fluorescence intensity of genetically encoded or chemical calcium indicators correlate with action potential firing in neurons, data analysis is based on inferring such spiking from changes in pixel intensity values across time within different regions of interest. However, the algorithms necessary to extract biologically relevant information from these fluorescent signals are complex and require significant expertise in programming to develop robust analysis pipelines. For decades, the only way to perform these analyses was for individual laboratories to write their own custom code. These routines were typically not well annotated and lacked intuitive graphical user interfaces (GUIs), which made it difficult for scientists in other laboratories to adopt them. Although the panorama is changing with recent tools like CaImAn, Suite2P and others, there is still a barrier for many laboratories to adopt these packages, especially for potential users without sophisticated programming skills. As 2-photon microscopes are becoming increasingly affordable, the bottleneck is no longer the hardware, but the software used to analyze the calcium data in an optimal manner and consistently across different groups. We addressed this unmet need by incorporating recent software solutions for motion correction, segmentation, signal extraction and deconvolution of calcium imaging data into an open-source, easy to use, GUI-based, intuitive and automated data analysis software, which we named EZcalcium.",,

Our aim was to design and test an affordable and easy-to-build noninvasive bilevel pressure ventilator to allow a reduction in the serious shortage of ventilators in LMICs. Methods The ventilator was built using off-the-shelf materials available via e-commerce and was based on a high-pressure blower, two pressure transducers and an Arduino Nano controller with a digital display (total retail cost <75 USD), with construction details provided open source for free replication. The ventilator was evaluated, and compared with a commercially available device (Lumis 150 ventilator; Resmed, San Diego, CA, USA): 1) in the bench setting using an actively breathing patient simulator mimicking a range of obstructive/restrictive diseases; and b) in 12 healthy volunteers wearing high airway resistance and thoracic/abdominal bands to mimic obstructive/restrictive patients. Results The designed ventilator provided inspiratory/expiratory pressures up to 20/10 cmH2O, respectively, with no faulty triggering or cycling; both in the bench test and in volunteers. The breathing difficulty score rated (1–10 scale) by the loaded breathing subjects was significantly (p<0.005) decreased from 5.45±1.68 without support to 2.83±1.66 when using the prototype ventilator, which showed no difference with the commercial device (2.80±1.48; p=1.000). Conclusion The low-cost, easy-to-build noninvasive ventilator performs similarly to a high-quality commercial device, with its open-source hardware description, which will allow for free replication and use in LMICs, facilitating application of this life-saving therapy to patients who otherwise could not be treated.

Stability of the PHIL simulation of a benchmark circuit is analyzed using the proposed DT modeling approach. The stability analysis is validated through simulations and experiments. The stability limits derived based on the proposed analysis are capable of suggesting maximum and minimum values of certain circuit parameters, as required for stability.",,

The main goal of AV1 is to provide an open source and royalty-free video coding format that substantially outperforms state-of-the-art codecs available on the market in compression efficiency while remaining practical decoding complexity as well as being optimized for hardware feasibility and scalability on modern devices. To give detailed insights into how the targeted performance and feasibility is realized, this paper provides a technical overview of key coding techniques in AV1. Besides, the coding performance gains are validated by video compression tests performed with the libaom AV1 encoder against the libvpx VP9 encoder.

This fact has led to a new concept called smart agriculture, and it contemplates activities such as field monitoring, which offer support to make decisions or perform actions, such as irrigation or fertilization. Apart from sensing devices, which use the Internet protocol to transfer data (Internet of Things), there are the so-called crop models, which are able to provide added value over the data provided by the sensors, with the aim of providing recommendations to farmers in decision-making and thus, increase the quality and quantity of their production. In this scenario, the current work uses a low-cost sensorized platform, capable of monitoring meteorological phenomena following the Internet of Things paradigm, with the goal to apply an alert disease model on the cultivation of the vine.

With regard to field monitoring systems, most studies in mines were classified as atmospheric or geotechnical monitoring. In wearable systems, the health status of the miner was an important consideration, in addition to the environmental conditions of the mine. Arduino can be a useful tool as an initial prototype for autonomous mine systems. Arduino has advantages in that it can be combined with various electronic products and is cost-effective.

Significance: Spatial frequency domain imaging (SFDI) is a diffuse optical measurement technique that can quantify tissue optical absorption (μa) and reduced scattering (μs′) on a pixel-by-pixel basis. Measurements of μa at different wavelengths enable the extraction of molar concentrations of tissue chromophores over a wide field, providing a noncontact and label-free means to assess tissue viability, oxygenation, microarchitecture, and molecular content. We present here openSFDI: an open-source guide for building a low-cost, small-footprint, three-wavelength SFDI system capable of quantifying μa and μs′ as well as oxyhemoglobin and deoxyhemoglobin concentrations in biological tissue. The companion website provides a complete parts list along with detailed instructions for assembling the openSFDI system. Aim: We describe the design of openSFDI and report on the accuracy and precision of optical property extractions for three different systems fabricated according to the instructions on the openSFDI website. Approach: Accuracy was assessed by measuring nine tissue-simulating optical phantoms with a physiologically relevant range of μa and μs′ with the openSFDI systems and a commercial SFDI device. Precision was assessed by repeatedly measuring the same phantom over 1 h. Results: The openSFDI systems had an error of 0  ±  6  %   in μa and −2  ±  3  %   in μs′, compared to a commercial SFDI system. Bland–Altman analysis revealed the limits of agreement between the two systems to be   ±  0.004  mm  −  1 for μa and −0.06 to 0.1  mm  −  1 for μs′. The openSFDI system had low drift with an average standard deviation of 0.0007  mm  −  1 and 0.05  mm  −  1 in μa and μs′, respectively. Conclusion: The openSFDI provides a customizable hardware platform for research groups seeking to utilize SFDI for quantitative diffuse optical imaging.",,

The fast evolving fields of machine learning and edge computing, which are seeing a continuous flow of novel algorithms and larger models, make CGRAs ideal architectures to allow domain specialization without losing too much generality. Designing and generating a CGRA, however, still requires to define the type and number of the specific functional units, implement their interconnect and the network topology, and perform the simulation and validation, given a variety of workloads of interest. In this paper, we propose OpenC-GRA *, the first open-source integrated framework that is able to support the full top-to-bottom design flow for specializing and implementing CGRAs: modeling at different abstraction levels (functional level, cycle level, register-transfer level) with compiler support, verification at different granularities (unit testing, integration testing, property-based testing), simulation, generation of synthesizable Verilog, and characterization (area, power, and timing).

We propose an alternate data-driven approach, which uses highly adaptable and retargettable open-source tools to target both commercial and research FPGA architectures. While challenges remain, we believe this approach makes the development of novel and commercial FPGA architectures faster and more accessible. Furthermore, it provides a path forward for industry, academia, and the open-source community to collaborate and combine their resources to advance FPGA technology.",,

The optical performance of the instrument was calibrated in the laboratory using a calibration target and preserved zooplankton. The IPAX was then deployed in the field to observe diversity, emergent patterns and phototactic behaviour of demersal zooplankton at night to demonstrate its practicality. Laboratory calibration indicated that the IPAX can resolve 100 mu m features with 70% contrast at the focal plane with 5 cm x 3 cm field of view and 5 mm depth of field. The instrument also resolved fine morphological details of preserved zooplankton when in focus. The field deployment demonstrated capability to resolve the myriad of zooplankton present in addition to the different phototactic behaviour that was elicited and observed from the different colour LEDs.

The Viscopette is specifically designed to improve user experience by adopting how to use commercial micropipettes, and fits within 7.3 cm x 7.3 cm x 38.8 cm (without the cut tubing piece) with an overall weight of 437 g for portable use. By exploiting the high level of controllability of the open-source microcontroller, the Viscopettes enables time-varying shear-rate (or flow-rate) control for viscosity analysis, and simple viscosity measurement by calculating the ratio of a pressure value measured using the inline pressure sensor and a set flow-rate condition.

For emerging technologies, such as ambient ionization mass spectrometry (AIMS), the assembly of a functional prototype is often more time-consuming than developing the actual probes. The modification of commercial platforms for testing hardware is usually not possible due to technical and legal restrictions. Therefore, we designed a robotic platform, which is based on RepRap 3D-printer components, and therefore easy to adopt for custom set-ups. Adjustable rails in an aluminium frame construction facilitate the mounting of additional parts such as sensors, probes, or optical components. The Open LabBot uses industry-standard G-code for its control. Its simple syntax facilitates the programming of the movement. We developed two programs for the robot control and mass spectrometry imaging: ""LABI-Imaging"" for synchronizing the robot movements and MS data acquisition and ""RmsiGUI"", a software solution for the complete AIMS workflow. We proved the functionality of the system by the automated sampling and classification of essential oils with a PlasmaChip probe. Further, we performed an AIMSI imaging experiment of a lime slice with laser desorption low-temperature plasma (LD-LTP) ionization, demonstrating the integration of the complete workflow in RmsiGUI. The design of the Open LabBot and the software are released under open licenses to promote their use and adoption in the instrument developers' community.",,

Although they can host different types of sensors, these vehicles were specifically designed for geophysical surveys, i.e., for the acquisition of bathymetric and stratigraphic data through single- and multibeam echosounders, side-scan sonars, and seismic-reflection systems. The main characteristic of the OpenSWAP vehicles is their ability of following pre-defined routes with high accuracy under acceptable weather and sea conditions. This would open the door to 4D (repeated) surveys, which constitute a powerful tool to analyze morphological and stratigraphic changes of the sediment/water interface and of the shallow substratum eventually caused by sediment dynamics (erosion vs. deposition), slumps and gravitative failures, earthquakes (slip along seismogenic faults and secondary effects of shaking), tsunamis, etc. The low cost and the open hardware/software architectures of these systems, which can be modified by the end users, lead for planning and execution of cooperative and adaptive surveys with different instruments not yet implemented or tested. Together with a technical description of the vehicles, we provide different case studies where they were successfully employed, carried out in environments not, or very difficultly accessed through conventional systems.",,

Methods: The hardware comprises a home-built 8-channel pTx system (scalable to 32-channels), wideband power amplifiers and a positioning system with submillimeter precision. The orthogonal projection (OP) method is used to mitigate RF induced tip heating and to maintain sufficientB1+for imaging. Experiments are performed at 297MHz and inside a clinical 3T MRI using 8-channel pTx RF coils, a guidewire substitute inside a phantom with attached thermistor and time-domainE-field probes. Results: Repeatability and precision are similar to 3% forE-field measurements including guidewire repositioning, similar to 3% for temperature slopes and an similar to 6% root-mean-square deviation betweenB1+measurements and simulations. Real-time pTx mitigation with the OP mode reduces theE-fields everywhere within the investigated area with a maximum reduction factor of 26 compared to the circularly polarized mode. Tip heating was measured with similar to 100 mu K resolution and similar to 14 Hz sampling frequency and showed substantial reduction for the OP vs CP mode. Conclusion: The pTx medical implant safety testbed presents a much-needed flexible and modular hardware configuration for the in-vitro assessment of implant safety, covering all field strengths from 0.5-7 T.

Recently, the appearance of RISC-V open-source ISA creates new possibilities to develop customized computing platforms with high savings in the non-recurring engineering costs. Moreover, the current trends toward open-source hardware frameworks are aimed to reduce design time and cost for complex system-on-chip architectures. Therefore, modularity and re-usability of hardware components are major challenges for flexible hardware architectures. The motivation behind this work is to introduce a modular cluster-based many-core architecture for FPGA accelerators that is re-usable and flexible tailored to implement different many-core taxonomies with less design time and costs by using regular and replicated sets of computing, memory, and interconnection blocks. The proposed many-core architecture is built using multiple processing clusters coupled with a NoC for communication which allows a high degree of design scalability. The processing cluster inside features a configurable multi-core architecture consisting of multiple RISC-V processing elements (PE) tightly coupled with a bus-based interconnection for intra-cluster communication using parameterized scratchpad shared memory. Each PE features a single RISC-V core with a tightly coupled parameterized scratchpad local memory and generic AXI interface. Evaluation results demonstrate that the proposed architecture features a scalable computing performance of 501 MOp/s for 4 clusters and 878 MOp/s for 8 clusters. Moreover, a scalable memory bandwidth up to 4.3 GB/s is achieved for 9 clusters with a power consumption of 1.4 W per cluster utilizing 7.7% of on-chip memory resources.

Therefore, and considering that COVID-19 generally causes damage to the respiratory system (in the form of lung infection), it is essential to ensure the best pulmonary ventilation for the patient. However, depending on the severity of the disease and the health condition of the patient, the situation can become critical when the patient has respiratory distress or becomes unable to breathe on his/her own. In that case, the ventilator becomes the lifeline of the patient. This device must keep patients stable until, on their own or with the help of medications, they manage to overcome the lung infection. However, with thousands or hundreds of thousands of infected patients, no country has enough ventilators. If this situation has become critical in the Global North, it has turned disastrous in developing countries, where ventilators are even more scarce. This article shows the race against time of a multidisciplinary research team at the University of Huelva, UHU, southwest of Spain, to develop an inexpensive, multifunctional, and easy-to-manufacture ventilator, which has been named ResUHUrge.

Simulation speed becomes even more crucial for agile and open-source hardware design methodologies, because the designers not only want to iterate on designs quicker, but they may also have less resources with which to simulate them. In this article, we execute multiple simulators and analyze them with hardware performance counters. We find some open-source simulators not only outperform a leading commercial simulator, they also achieve comparable or higher instruction throughput on the host processor. Although advanced optimizations may increase the complexity of the simulator, they do not significantly hinder instruction throughput. Our findings make the case that there is significant room to accelerate software simulation and open-source simulators are a great starting point for researchers.",,

IoT devices are currently being used in many fields. IoT devices use Wi-Fi and Bluetooth, however, communication distance is short and battery consumption is high. In areas such as smart cities and smart farms, IoT technology is needed to support a wide coverage with low power consumption. Low Power Wide Area (LPWA), which is a transmission used in IoT supporting a wide area with low power consumption, has evolved. LPWA includes Long Range (LoRa), Narrowband (NB-IoT), and Sigfox. LoRa offers many benefits as it communicates the longest distances, is cheap and consumes less battery. LoRa is used in many countries and covers a range of hundreds of square kilometers (km(2)) with a single gateway. However, if there are many obstacles to smart cities and smart farms, it causes communication problems. This paper proposes two (2) solutions to this problem: the relay method which is a multi-hop method and the Automatic Repeat Request (ARQ) system that detects packet loss in real-time and requests retransmission for LoRa. In this study, the actual performance of LoRa in the problematic environment was measured and the proposed method was applied. It was confirmed that the transmission rate of LoRa dropped when there were many obstacles such as trees. To use LoRa in a smart farm with a lot of space, multi-hop was observed to be better. An ARQ system is needed to compensate for the unexpected drop in the forward rate due to the increase in IoT devices. This research focused on reliability, however, additional network methods and automatic repeat request (ARQ) systems considering battery time should be researched in symmetry. This study covers the interdisciplinary field of computer science and wireless low power communication engineering. We have analyzed the LoRa/LoRaWAN technology in an experimental approach, which has been somewhat less studied than cellular network or WiFi technology.

This article presents the development of a low-cost, open hardware resistivity meter to provide the scientific community with a robust and flexible tool for small-scale experiments. Called OhmPi, this basic resistivity meter features current injection and measurement functions associated with a multiplexer that allows performing automatic measurements with up to 32 electrodes (at a cost of less than $500). The device was first tested using a soil-analog electrical circuit to verify the reliability and robustness of the measurements. Results show that OhmPi offers a wide range of resistance measurements, from 0.2 to 1000 O, for contact resistances between 100 and 5000 O.

The stated mission of the ANSS is to ""... provide accurate and timely data and information products for seismic events, including their effects on buildings and structures, employing modern monitoring methods and technologies."" In this article, an approach (xQuake) is proposed that does not interfere in any way with the mission of the National Earthquake Information Center and ANSS but instead restores much of the community focus and international collaboration that has been lost over the past two decades. xQuake uses an executable graph framework in a pipeline architecture; this framework can be seamlessly integrated into current ANSS quake monitoring systems. This newapproach incorporatesmodern approaches to computer analytics, including multitopic Kafka exchange rings, cloud computing, a self-configuring phase associator, and machine learning. The xGraph system is free for noncommercial use, open source, hardware agnostic (Windows, Linux, Mac), with no requirement for commercial datastores.",,

There remain, however, various challenges with respect to the concept of Industry 4.0 before this new reality is fully integrated into the industrial sector. One such challenge is ensuring security, an essential issue in terms of both management and operational technology involving the configuration and administration of physical equipment. Another is integrating equipment from different manufacturers which must be configured and/or administered with incompatible protocols. Likewise, remote access to systems must be carried out from a browser in the web frame. This paper presents a set of tools, available as a cloud-based service, which facilitates access to the physical equipment located in a business. The access enables the end user to see and/or modify the configuration and management of data in a secure, controlled, organized and collaborative manner. In order to unify different protocols, the service makes use of the Modbus TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol) protocol, one of the most commonly used by industry in local networks. The local Modbus communications are encapsulated in the Websocket protocol to make them accessible from the cloud. The tools proposed in this paper are based on open hardware platforms and free software, and they permit local and remote sensors and actuators to be fully and easily accessed. Hence, their chief advantage is that they allow access from any internet connection, via a browser, to the physical equipment located in an industry by means of user profiles in accordance with the security level set by each individual company.",,

When motor actuators were used for robot development in the past, it was difficult to find cost-effective commercial products. Open-source motor controllers, recently developed with the collaboration of many people, have exhibited phenomenal growth as their performance is now comparable to those of commercial products and their price is cheaper. In this study, we utilized an open-source Vedder electronic speed controller (VESC), originally developed for electric skateboards, as a general-purpose motor controller for robot control. The high-speed, high-torque, and high-output VESC was hardware-upgraded to enable more accurate current control, and advanced position and speed control algorithms were developed to produce Myongji-VESC (MJ-VESC), a general-purpose motor controller for multiaxis robot systems. To evaluate its current, speed, and position control performances, MJ-VESC was applied to an open-source planetary geared actuator that can be fabricated with a 3D printer. Based on this, we propose an open-source motor controller framework that can be universally used for multiaxis robot systems.",,

However, multi-color or hyperspectral SMLM can pose particular challenges which affect image quality and data interpretation, such as unequal photophysical performance of fluorophores and non-linear image registration issues, which arise as two emission channels travel along different optical paths to reach the detector. In addition, using evanescent-wave based approaches (Total Internal Reflection Fluorescence: TIRF) where beam shape, decay depth, and power density are important, different illumination wavelengths can lead to unequal imaging depth across multiple channels on the same sample. A potential useful approach would be to use a single excitation wavelength to perform hyperspectral localization imaging. We report herein on the use of a variable angle tunable thin-film filter to spectrally isolate far-red emitting fluorophores. This solution was integrated into a commercial microscope platform using an open-source hardware design, enabling the rapid acquisition of SMLM images arising from fluorescence emission captured within similar to 15 nm to 20 nm spectral windows (or detection bands). By characterizing intensity distributions, average intensities, and localization frequency through a range of spectral windows, we investigated several far-red emitting fluorophores and identified an optimal fluorophore pair for two-color SMLM using this method. Fluorophore crosstalk between the different spectral windows was assessed by examining the effect of varying the photon output thresholds on the localization frequency and fraction of data recovered. The utility of this approach was demonstrated by hyper-spectral super-resolution imaging of the interaction between the mitochondrial protein, TOM20, and the peroxisomal protein, PMP70.",,

Synthetic biology is also growing in many developing countries of Africa, Asia and Latin America, where it could have a large economic impact by helping its use of genetic biodiversity in order to boost existing industries. Starting in 2011, Argentine synthetic biology developed along an idiosyncratic path. In 2011-2012, the main focus was not exclusively research but also on community building through teaching and participation in iGEM, following the template of the early ""MIT school"" of synthetic biology. In 2013-2015, activities diversified and included society-centered projects, social science studies on synthetic biology and bioart. Standard research outputs such as articles and industrial applications helped consolidate several academic working groups. Since 2016, the lack of a critical mass of researchers and a funding crisis were partially compensated by establishing links with Latin American synthetic biologists and with other socially oriented open technology collectives. The TECNOx community is a central node in this growing research and technology network. The first four annual TECNOx meetings brought together synthetic biologists with other open science and engineering platforms and explored the relationship of Latin American technologies with entrepreneurship, open hardware, ethics and human rights. In sum, the socioeconomic context encouraged Latin American synthetic biology to develop in a meandering and diversifying manner.

His aim is neither environmental protection nor the prevention of unforeseen side-effects of technology development, but the comprehensibility of technologies' operating principles for the user. For if the construction or repairing of tools requires expert knowledge inaccessible to the public, this necessarily entails social imbalances in power. In a similar manner, Bernard Stiegler conceives the delegation of know-how to technological systems as a kind of proletarianization that ultimately may result in a loss of savoir-vivre. Without sweepingly rejecting the division of labour, automation or specialized knowledge, practices of commoning respond to such diagnoses: free software like GNU/Linux or open hardware largely succeed in unlinking the expert knowledge that advanced computing doubtlessly requires from problematic power effects. From this perspective, proprietary algorithms are problematic, as their lack of transparency prevents conviviality. This also holds for the practices of data aggregation and extraction which steadily increase the information gap between platform providers and users. An even more fundamental problem is posed by so-called ""self-learning"", i.e., recursively adapting, algorithms: it is not clear how and to what extent the knowledge and instructions generated by ""artificial intelligence"" can be traced and reconstructed by human insight. Thus, we are confronted with a situation of potentially non-recoverable proletarianization and non-conviviality that exposes a renewed urgency of Illich's considerations concerning technological self-limitation.",,

Increased specimen thickness degrades resolution with beam broadening alongside loss of contrast. The large inelastic cross-section of carbon hampers accurate atomic species detection. Oxygen and water molecules pose problems of lattice damage by chemically etching the specimen during imaging. These constraints on high-resolution and spectroscopic imaging demand clean, high-vacuum microscopes with dry pumps. Here, we present an open-hardware design of a high-vacuum manifold for transmission electron microscopy (TEM) holders to mitigate hydrocarbon and residual species exposure. We quantitatively show that TEM holders are inherently dirty and introduce a range of unwanted chemical species. Overnight storage in our manifold reduces contaminants by one to two orders of magnitude and promotes two to four times faster vacuum recovery. A built-in bakeout system further reduces contaminants partial pressure to below 10(-10 )hPa (Torr) (approximately four orders of magnitude down from ambient storage) and alleviates monolayer adsorption during a typical TEM experiment. We determine that bakeout of TEM holder with specimen held therein is the optimal cleaning method. Our high-vacuum manifold design is published with open-source blueprints, parts, and cost list.",,

A small-scale autonomous pontoon boat has been built, equipped with the open-hardware flight controller, GPS receiver, Inertial Measurement Units (IMU) and the magnetometer. A 2(3) factorial design based on Design of Experiment (DOE) is carried out to study the influence of three parameters (turn_rate, turn_angle and damping) on the response variable (peak-to-peak deviation from the desired trajectory). Total 24 experiments have been conducted by setting the desired trajectory as a circle with diameter 20 m. The peak-to-peak deviation in each experiment has been observed. The analyses revealed that the damping has low interaction with the turn angle and turn rate while there is a stronger interaction between the turn angle and turn rate. And the peak-to-peak deviation of the trajectory tends to decrease when the parameter damping was set to high value. The regression model has been derived and plotted as a response surface. The optimized parameters were selected from the plot and perform the experiment with three replications. The results confirm that parameters tuning has improved the performance of the boat significantly. With the DOE approach, the impact of two or more parameters on a response, the interaction between parameters can be investigated systematically. This approach is an effective way to tuning the parameters and can be applied to various kinds of the autonomous vehicle.",,

This has been found to be 10 times less cost than the general‐purpose computing equipment available on the market, with a substantial reduction in shockwave data processing time and effort. The setup has been tested with the different diaphragms producing shockwaves of different Mach numbers. The experimental results are compared with the theoretical values obtained using normal shock relations and are found to be consistent with admissible error limits.

There is an open area to develop and to build didactic modules to improve the learning process using experimentation in real physical systems. Particularly, a cart inverted pendulum is a classical physical system very commonly used in recent decades. We propose a cart inverted pendulum named MoDiCA-X as a low-cost didactic module with open source hardware and software. It is an electromechanical system feasible to build and easy to be modified. The mechanical parts of the module are 3D printed solids and can also be easily replicated. In terms of programming, the control applied to the system can be modified, since it uses C/C++ programming languages that are widely used in the academic community. The module is equipped with two very commercial sensors, are easy to install and to remove; both acquire the pendulum attitude and the car position. The actuators are four electric DC motors coupled to the car wheels to provide suitable velocity and torque to each axle independently. We validate the performance of the module by applying a multivariable linear quadratic regulator algorithm (LQR). (C) 2020 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.",,

Over a period of 11 years, the Centre has embarked on an initiative of upgrading and expanding the current network with combinations of broadband and/or strong motion sensors, high dynamic range digitizers and networking equipment to link each station to centralized observatories via high speed digital data transmission medium. To realize such an upgrade and expansion, the Centre has developed a seismic data acquisition system prototype built using open-source hardware and software tools. The prototype is intended to be low-cost using off the shelf hardware components and open-source seismic related software handling data acquisition and data processing in two separate modules. The prototype uses a three-channel accelerometer sensor and can process data into standard MiniSEED format for easy data archiving and seismic data analysis. A global position module provides network time protocol time synchronization within 1 millisecond for accurate timestamping of data. Data can be stored locally on the prototype in twenty-minute data files or securely transferred to a central location via internet with the use of virtual private network capabilities. The prototype is modular in design allowing for components to be replaced easily and the system software can be updated remotely thus reducing maintenance cost.",,

Drifters that can be tracked in real time have so far been rather expensive. Recently, due to the rise of the open-hardware revolution and the associated Arduino ecosystem, both GPS receivers and cellular modems have become available at lower prices to ""tinkering scientists"", i.e., scientists that like to build their own measurement devices as much as is possible. This article serves two goals. Firstly, we provide detailed instructions on how to build a low-power GPS drifter with local storage and cellular model that we tested in a fieldwork on the confluence of the Chindwin and Ayeyarwady rivers in Myanmar. The device was designed from easily connected off-the-shelf components, allowing construction without a background in electrical engineering. The instructions allow fellow geoscientists to recreate the device. Secondly, we set the following question: has the open-hardware revolution progressed to the point that a low-power GPS drifter that wirelessly transmits its position can be made from open-hardware components by most geoscientists?. We feel this question is relevant and timely as more low-cost open-hardware devices are promoted, but in practice applicability is often restricted to the ""tinkering engineer"". We argue that because of the plug-and-play nature of the components geoscientists should be able to construct these type of devices. However, to get such devices to operate at low power levels that fieldwork often demands requires detailed (micro)electrical expertise.",,

Samples were instrumentally processed in a relatively short time, and neither an intentional reduction of the linear flow rate nor an unconventional fluorescence instrument were required. Through the inclusion of external circuitry based on open-source hardware, the occurrence time of each individual fluorescence intensity reading was recorded. For the reported instrumental setup, irregular signal sampling was verified. In order to consider samples-specific time measurements, the PARAFAC (Parallel Factor Analysis) algorithm, and the derived APARAFAC (Augmented-PARAFAC) strategy, were adapted. The functional information was employed during the computational stages, through the development and implementation of smoothing strategies. To tackle differences between the rate of spectral acquisition and the rate of change in the concentration of the mobile fluorophores, Expectation Maximization was implemented. Data from samples with one calibrated analyze (Vitamin B6-Pyridoxine), in presence of uncalibrated interferents, were modeled. In order to preserve the original data structure, unfolding data operations were minimized. The resolved profiles of all species were in agreement with the corresponding chromatographic and spectral references. Results suggest that the effects derived from the loss of trilinearity previously reported in the literature for LC-EEM data, depend on interpretation and subsequent modeling of the data. The reported strategies can be useful with other flow techniques and kinetics.",,

In the activity, a physical phenomenon present in the homeothermic animals was modeled, consisting of the greater exposure to heat transfer in young animals compared to adult specimens of the same species. This thermal situation has important consequences for animal behavior. The explanation is based on the fact that the relationship between the body area of the small animal and that of the adult, gives a greater value than the relationship between the respective volumes. Representative aluminum pieces are used to model the phenomenon, and open hardware is used to perform the temperature measurements in a calorimetry experiment.

However, the commercially available instruments for studying operant conditioning are expensive, and the design of low-cost chambers has emerged as an appealing alternative to resource-limited laboratories engaged in animal behavior. In this article, we provide a full description of a platform that records the operant behavior and synchronizes it with the electrophysiological activity. The programming of this platform is open source, flexible, and adaptable to a wide range of operant conditioning tasks.

The usage of idle TV channels in the Television Ultra High Frequencies (TV-UHF) band (500-698 MHz), also known as Television White Spaces (TVWS), is a relatively new and promising concept for wireless connectivity that can be used to cater to the demand. A challenge in this setting is to figure out a fast and cost-effective method of TVWS presence estimation, such as the use of open hardware and software tools, reducing sensing time. This article proposes a Rapid Estimation Method (REM) for TVWS estimation that uses the statistical information of the sensed signals. Our probabilistic approach analyzes the collected parameters of more than eight million data samples taken by scanning the TV-UHF spectrum in the city of Windsor, ON, Canada. The calculated statistical parameters and a group of auxiliary parameters were combined to estimate rapidly the amount of TVWS available in the sensed locations. By applying the proposed rapid estimation method, the presence of TVWS was identified and verified with an accuracy of about 76% according to the results obtained, the average variation when comparing the calculated and detected probabilities of TVWS was in a range of 15%, and the method could be a viable solution to the spectrum need.",,

In addition to estimating the fidelity of results generated by quantum execution, the suite is designed to benchmark certain aspects of the execution pipeline in order to provide end users with a practical measure of both the quality of and the time to solution. Our methodology is constructed to anticipate advances in quantum computing hardware that are likely to emerge in the next five years.

The toolkit is under active development and is centered around the concept of an “analog tile” which captures the computations performed on a crossbar array. Analog tiles are building blocks that can be used to extend existing network modules with analog components and compose arbitrary artificial neural networks (ANNs) using the flexibility of the PYTORCH framework. Analog tiles can be conveniently configured to emulate a plethora of different analog hardware characteristics and their non-idealities, such as device-to-device and cycle-to-cycle variations, resistive device response curves, and weight and output noise. Additionally, the toolkit makes it possible to design custom unit cell configurations and to use advanced analog optimization algorithms such as Tiki-Taka. Moreover, the backward and update behavior can be set to “ideal"" to enable hardware-aware training features for chips that target inference acceleration only. To evaluate the inference accuracy of such chips over time, we provide statistical programming noise and drift models calibrated on phase-change memory hardware. Our new toolkit is fully GPU accelerated and can be used to conveniently estimate the impact of material properties and non-idealities of future analog technology on the accuracy for arbitrary ANNs.",,

Computer systems employ a range of techniques to reduce overheads tied to data movement, spanning from traditional mechanisms (e.g., deep multi-level cache hierarch ies, aggressive hardware prefetcher s) to emerging techniques such as Near-Data Processing (NDP), where some computation is moved close to memory. Prior NDP works investigate the root causes of data movement bottlenecks using different profiling methodologies and tools. However, there is still a lack of understanding about the key metrics that can identify different data movement bottlenecks and their relation to traditional and emerging data movement mitigation mechanisms. Our goal is to methodically identify potential sources of data movement over a broad set of applications and to comprehensively compare traditional compute-centric data movement mitigation techniques (e.g., cach ing and prefetch ing) to more memory-centric techniques (e.g., NDP), thereby developing a rigorous understanding of the best techniques to mitigate each source of data movement. With this goal in mind, we perform the first large-scale characterization of a wide variety of applications, across a wide range of application domains, to identify fundamental program properties that lead to data movement to/from main memory. We develop the first systematic methodology to classify applications based on the sources contributing to data movement bottlenecks. From our large-scale characterization of 77K functions across 345 applications, we select 144 functions to form the first open-source benchmark suite (DAMOV) for main memory data movement studies. We select a diverse range of functions that (1) represent different types of data movement bottlenecks, and (2) come from a wide range of application domains. Using NDP as a case study, we identify new insights about the different data movement bottlenecks and use these insights to determine the most suitable data movement mitigation mechanism for a particular application.

In this new design approach, the user defines every segment of the print-path along with all printing parameters, which may be related to geometric and non-geometric factors, at all points along the print-path. Machine control code (GCode) is directly generated by the software, without the need for any programming skills and without using computer-aided design (CAD), STL-files or slicing software. Excel is used as the front end for the software, which is written in Visual Basic. Case studies are used to demonstrate the broad range of structures that can be designed using the software, including: precisely controlled specimens for printer calibration, parametric specimens for hardware characterisation utilising hundreds of unique parameter combinations, novel mathematically defined lattice structures, and previously inconceivable 3D geometries that are impossible for traditional slicing software to achieve. The FullControl design approach enables unconstrained freedom to create nonplanar 3D print-paths and break free from traditional restrictions of layerwise print-path planning. It also allows nozzle movements to be carefully designed - both during extrusion and while travelling between disconnected extrusion volumes - to overcome inherent limitations of the printing process or to improve capabilities for challenging materials. An industrial case study shows how explicit print-path design improved printer reliability, production time, and print quality for a production run of over 1,000 parts. FullControl GCode Designer offers a general framework for unconstrained design and is not limited to a particular type of structure or hardware; transferability to lasers and other manufacturing processes is discussed. Parametric design files use a few bytes or kilobytes of data to describe all details that are sent to the printer, which greatly improves shareability by eliminating any risk of errors being introduced during STL file conversion or due to different users having inconsistent slicer settings. Adjustable parameters allow GCode for revised designs to be produced instantly, instead of the laborious traditional routine using multiple software packages and file conversions. The FullControl design concept offers new opportunities for creative and high-precision use of additive manufacturing systems. It facilitates design for additive manufacturing (DfAM) at the smallest possible scale based on the fundamental nature of the process (i.e. assembly of individual extrusions). The software and source code are provided as supplementary data and ongoing updates to improve functionality and the user interface will be available at www.fullcontrolgcode.com.",,

Meanwhile, graph processing has attracted tremendous interest in data analytics, and its performance is in increasing demand with the rapid growth of data. Many works have been proposed to tackle the challenges of designing efficient FPGA-based accelerators for graph processing. However, the largely overlooked programmability still requires hardware design expertise and sizable development efforts from developers. In order to close the gap, we propose ThunderGP, an open-source HLS-based graph processing framework on FPGAs, with which developers could enjoy the performance of FPGA-accelerated graph processing by writing only a few high-level functions with no knowledge of the hardware. ThunderGP adopts the Gather-Apply-Scatter (GAS) model as the abstraction of various graph algorithms and realizes the model by a build-in highly-paralleled and memory-efficient accelerator template. With high-level functions as inputs, ThunderGP automatically explores the massive resources and memory bandwidth of multiple Super Logic Regions (SLRs) on FPGAs to generate accelerator and then deploys the accelerator and schedules tasks for the accelerator. We evaluate ThunderGP with seven common graph applications. The results show that accelerators on real hardware platforms deliver 2.9 times speedup over the state-of-the-art approach, running at 250MHz and achieving throughput up to 6,400 MTEPS (Million Traversed Edges Per Second). We also conduct a case study with ThunderGP, which delivers up to 419 times speedup over the CPU-based design and requires significantly reduced development efforts.

A barrier found when deploying experimental smart grids and microgrids consists of handling the heterogeneity of the required hardware and software components as well as the available commercial equipment. Despite the fact that there is various architecture proposed in previous literature, it commonly lacks experimental validation, specification of involved equipment concerning industrial/proprietary or open-source nature, and concretization of communication protocols. To overcome such drawbacks, this paper proposes an innovative multi-layered architecture to deploy heterogeneous automation and monitoring systems for microgrids. The architecture is structured into six functional layers to organize the hardware and software equipment in an integrated manner. The open protocol Modbus TCP is chosen to harmonize communications, enabling the interconnection of equipment from industrial and energy scopes, indeed of open-source nature.

Optical motion capture systems are the current standard for estimating kinematics but require expensive equipment located in a predefined space. While wearable sensor systems can estimate kinematics in any environment, existing systems are generally less accurate than optical motion capture. Further, many wearable sensor systems require a computer in close proximity and rely on proprietary software, making it difficult for researchers to reproduce experimental findings. Here, we present OpenSenseRT, an open-source and wearable system that estimates upper and lower extremity kinematics in real time by using inertial measurement units and a portable microcontroller. We compared the OpenSenseRT system to optical motion capture and found an average RMSE of 4.4 degrees across 5 lower-limb joint angles during three minutes of walking (n = 5) and an average RMSE of 5.6 degrees across 8 upper extremity joint angles during a Fugl-Meyer task (n = 5). The open-source software and hardware are scalable, tracking between 1 and 14 body segments, with one sensor per segment. Kinematics are estimated in real-time using a musculoskeletal model and inverse kinematics solver. The computation frequency, depends on the number of tracked segments, but is sufficient for real-time measurement for many tasks of interest; for example, the system can track up to 7 segments at 30 Hz in real-time. The system uses off-the-shelf parts costing approximately $100 USD plus $20 for each tracked segment.

A QSS includes a quantum programming language, an optimizing compiler that translates a quantum algorithm written in a high-level language into quantum gate instructions, a quantum simulator that emulates these instructions on a classical device, and a software controller that sends analog signals to a very expensive quantum hardware based on quantum circuits. In comparison to traditional compilers and architecture simulators, QSSes are difficult to tests due to the probabilistic nature of results, the lack of clear hardware specifications, and quantum programming complexity.This work devises a novel differential testing approach for QSSes, named QDiff with three major innovations: (1) We generate input programs to be tested via semantics-preserving, source to source transformation to explore program variants. (2) We speed up differential testing by filtering out quantum circuits that are not worthwhile to execute on quantum hardware by analyzing static characteristics such as a circuit depth, 2-gate operations, gate error rates, and T1 relaxation time. (3) We design an extensible equivalence checking mechanism via distribution comparison functions such as Kolmogorov–Smirnov test and cross entropy.We evaluate QDiff with three widely-used open source QSSes: Qiskit from IBM, Cirq from Google, and Pyquil from Rigetti. By running QDiff on both real hardware and quantum simulators, we found several critical bugs revealing potential instabilities in these platforms. QDiff’s source transformation is effective in producing semantically equivalent yet not-identical circuits (i.e., 34% of trials), and its filtering mechanism can speed up differential testing by 66%.",,

In this work, we present PERCIVAL, an application-level posit RISC-V core based on CVA6 that can execute all posit instructions, including the quire fused operations. This solves the obstacle encountered by previous works, which only included partial posit support or which had to emulate posits in software. In addition, Xposit, a RISC-V extension for posit instructions is incorporated into LLVM. Therefore, PERCIVAL is the first work that integrates the complete posit instruction set in hardware. These elements allow for the native execution of posit instructions as well as the standard floating-point ones, further permitting the comparison of these representations. FPGA and ASIC synthesis show the hardware cost of implementing 32-bit posits and highlight the significant overhead of including a quire accumulator. However, results show that the quire enables a more accurate execution of dot products. In general matrix multiplications, the accuracy error is reduced up to 4 orders of magnitude. Furthermore, performance comparisons show that these accuracy improvements do not hinder their execution, as posits run as fast as single-precision floats and exhibit better timing than double-precision floats, thus potentially providing an alternative representation.",,

However, such globalization also poses various security threats in each phase of the IC supply chain. Although the advancements of Machine Learning (ML) have pushed the frontier of hardware security, most conventional ML-based methods can only achieve the desired performance by manually finding a robust feature representation for circuits that are non-Euclidean data. As a result, modeling these circuits using graph learning to improve design flows has attracted research attention in the Electronic Design Automation (EDA) field. However, due to the lack of supporting tools, only a few existing works apply graph learning to resolve hardware security issues. To attract more attention, we propose HW2VEC, an open-source graph learning tool that lowers the threshold for newcomers to research hardware security applications with graphs. HW2VEC provides an automated pipeline for extracting a graph representation from a hardware design in various abstraction levels (register transfer level or gate-level netlist). Besides, HW2VEC users can automatically transform the non-Euclidean hardware designs into Euclidean graph embeddings for solving their problems. In this paper, we demonstrate that HW2VEC can achieve state-of-the-art performance on two hardware security-related tasks: Hardware Trojan Detection and Intellectual Property Piracy Detection.

In this work, we first propose an ISA extension to RISC-V that supports GPGPUs and graphics. The main goal of the ISA extension proposal is to minimize the ISA changes so that the corresponding changes to the open-source ecosystem are also minimal, which makes for a sustainable development ecosystem. To demonstrate the feasibility of the minimally extended RISC-V ISA, we implemented the complete software and hardware stacks of Vortex on FPGA.

However, extracting calcium signals from raw videos is a computationally complex problem and remains a bottleneck for many researchers utilizing single-photon in vivo calcium imaging. Despite the existence of many powerful analysis packages designed to detect and extract calcium dynamics, most have either key parameters that are hard-coded or insufficient step-by-step guidance and validations to help the users choose the best parameters. This makes it difficult to know whether the output is reliable and meets the assumptions necessary for proper analysis. Moreover, large memory demand is often a constraint for setting up these pipelines since it limits the choice of hardware to specialized computers. Given these difficulties, there is a need for a low memory demand, user-friendly tool offering interactive visualizations of how altering parameters at each step of the analysis affects data output. Our open-source analysis pipeline, Minian (Miniscope Analysis), facilitates the transparency and accessibility of single-photon calcium imaging analysis, permitting users with little computational experience to extract the location of cells and their corresponding calcium traces and deconvolved neural activities. Minian contains interactive visualization tools for every step of the analysis, as well as detailed documentation and tips on parameter exploration. Furthermore, Minian has relatively small memory demands and can be run on a laptop, making it available to labs that do not have access to specialized computational hardware. Minian has been validated to reliably and robustly extract calcium events across different brain regions and from different cell types. In practice, Minian provides an open-source calcium imaging analysis pipeline with user-friendly interactive visualizations to explore parameters and validate results.",,

However, the relatively high cost of tooling conventional manufacturing processes for these collectors makes them difficult to afford in the most impoverished regions. This work presents the development of low-cost CPC and parabolic through solar collectors (PTC) by 3D printing of the structure and the use of recycled reflective materials. Besides, open-source hardware has been used to control system operation, including a supplementary UV LED system to compensate for the operation under low solar irradiance. Regarding the tested reflective materials, an optimum is obtained using an aluminium adhesive sheet that leads to an efficiency of 80% compared to a commercial CPC made of high-quality anodised aluminium, being the cost 20 times lower. On the other hand, incorporating a low-cost solar tracking system in a printed PTC reactor could lead to efficiencies up to 300% compared to the commercial CPC, while the cost was 4.5 times lower. Finally, the LED compensation system was successfully validated, allowing the operation with a constant treatment capacity during operation in cloudy conditions. In conclusion, the developed collectors are high-performance solar water treatment systems with a significantly lower investment cost, making them affordable worldwide. (c) 2021 The Authors.

Applications range from prototyping to small-scale production, with 3D printing offering reduced logistics overheads, better design flexibility and ease of use compared with traditional fabrication methods. In addition, printer and material costs have also decreased rapidly. These advantages make 3D printing attractive for application in microfluidic chip fabrication. However, 3D printing microfluidics is still a new area. Is the technology mature enough to print complex microchannel geometries, such as droplet microfluidics? Can 3D-printed droplet microfluidic chips be used in biological or chemical applications? Is 3D printing mature enough to be used in every research lab? These are the questions we will seek answers to in our systematic review. We will analyze (1) the key performance metrics of 3D-printed droplet microfluidics and (2) existing biological or chemical application areas.

These methods are basically based on the recording of seismic ambient noise and analysis of its spectral features. Although these techniques are more practical than traditional seismic methods, the commercial instruments designed for recording the seismic ambient noise are quite expensive. Furthermore, most of these instruments require an external computer for recording and monitoring the data. In this sense, this article intends to present a low-cost and Raspberry Pi single-board microcomputer aided seismic ambient noise recording and monitoring system (RaspMI) as an alternative to the computer aided commercial seismic noise measurement systems.

An important direction of research has been to decompose an arbitrary entangled state, represented as a unitary, into a quantum circuit, that is, a sequence of gates supported by a quantum processor. It has been well known that circuits with longer decompositions and more entangling multi-qubit gates are error-prone for the current noisy, intermediate-scale quantum devices. To this end, there has been a significant interest to develop heuristic-based methods to discover compact circuits. We contribute to this effort by proposing QuantumCircuitOpt (QCOpt), a novel open-source framework which implements mathematical optimization formulations and algorithms for decomposing arbitrary unitary gates into a sequence of hardware-native gates. A core innovation of QCOpt is that it provides optimality guarantees on the quantum circuits that it produces. In particular, we show that QCOpt can find up to 57% reduction in the number of necessary gates on circuits with up to four qubits, and in run times less than a few minutes on commodity computing hardware. We also validate the efficacy of QCOpt as a tool for quantum circuit design in comparison with a naive brute-force enumeration algorithm. We also show how the QCOpt package can be adapted to various built-in types of native gate sets, based on different hardware platforms like those produced by IBM, Rigetti and Google.

IoT devices are mainly powered by low-cost microcontrollers (MCUs) that typically lack basic hardware security mechanisms to separate security-critical applications from less critical components. Recently, Arm has started to release Cortex-M MCUs enhanced with TrustZone technology (i.e., TrustZone-M), a system-wide security solution aiming at providing robust protection for IoT devices. Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) relying on TrustZone hardware have been perceived as safe havens for securing mobile devices. However, for the past few years, considerable effort has gone into unveiling hundreds of vulnerabilities and proposing a collection of relevant defense techniques to address several issues. While new TEE solutions built on TrustZone-M start flourishing, the lessons gathered from the research community appear to be falling short, as these new systems are trapping into the same pitfalls of the past. In this paper, we present uTango, the first multi-world TEE for modern IoT devices. uTango proposes a novel architecture aiming at tackling the major architectural deficiencies currently affecting TrustZone(-M)-assisted TEEs. In particular, we leverage the very same TrustZone hardware primitives used by dual-world implementations to create multiple and equally secure execution environments within the normal world. We demonstrate the benefits of uTango by conducting an extensive evaluation on a real TrustZone-M hardware platform, i.e., Arm Musca-B1. uTango will be open-sourced and freely available on GitHub in hopes of engaging academia and industry on securing the foreseeable trillion IoT devices.",,

However, most vitrification tools adopted in aquatic research were initially designed for applications other than sperm (such as human embryo freezing) and, thus, pose challenges for adoption to sperm vitrification. Three-dimensional (3D) printing combined with open hardware sharing is an emerging strategy to address challenges in the development of cryopreservation tools. The goal of this study was to develop a 3D printed Vitrification Device for Cryo-Vials (VDCV) that can be integrated with the existing vial storage systems. The VDCV combined the vitrification and handling components to achieve functions of sample handling, vitrification, storage, and identification. The vitrification component featured a base, a stem, and a loop. A total of 36 configurations with various loop lengths (8, 10, and 12 mm); loop widths (2.0, 2.5, 3.0, and 3.5 mm); and support structures (open, transverse, and axial) of the VDCD prototypes were designed, fabricated, and tested. Device handling orientations (horizontal and vertical holding angles prior to and during freezing) were also investigated. Computer simulations estimated that the cooling rate of the samples ranged from 0.6-1.5 x 10(5) degrees C/min in all the configurations. Prior to freezing, loops with axial supports produced a minimum of 92% film retention. The overall trends of full vitrification occurrence were observed: horizontal plunging > vertical plunging, and axial support > transverse support and open loop. A loop length of 8 mm had the highest overall vitrification occurrence (86-100%). No significant differences (p = 0.6584) were shown in a volume capacity (5.7-6.0 mu L) among the three supporting configurations. A single unit of VDCV can provide loading efficiencies of about 6 x 10(7) sperm/vial, pooling of samples from 3-6 males/vial, and fertilization for 1800 eggs/vial. The VDCV are low-cost (<$0.5 material cost per unit) and can be customized, standardized, securely labeled, and efficiently stored.

The present study explored the feasibility of developing operational prototypes of 3-D printed motorized cryopreservation devices for continuous freezing of non-batched samples. A controlled cooling conveyor device (CCCD) was designed and fabricated to cryopreserve sperm samples in straws that were loaded onto chain links suspended over liquid nitrogen held in a Styrofoam box. Cooling rates of 5-34 degrees C/min for 0.5-mL French straws were produced by adjusting the height of conveyor chains, slopes, and liquid nitrogen mass. The plunge temperature (-47 degrees C to -61 degrees C) was controlled by adjustment of conveyor speed. The cooling curves from the CCCD were comparable to a commercial programmable freezer. There were no significant differences in post-thaw motility of sperm from ornamental (Koi) common carp (Cyprinus carpio) among samples frozen with the CCCD and those frozen with a commercial programmable freezer. The post-thaw sperm motility was consistent among samples frozen in the CCCD across a 15-min time span.

The MeteoMex project aims to build simple hardware kits and their integration into current Internet-of-Things (IoT) platforms. This paper shows the use of low-end Wemos D1 mini boards to connect environmental sensors to the open-source platform ThingsBoard. Two printed circuit boards (PCB) were designed for mounting components. Analog, digital and (IC)-C-2 sensors are supported. The Wemos ESP8266 microchip provides WiFi capability and can be programed with the Arduino IDE. Application examples for the MeteoMex aeria and terra kits demonstrate their functionality for air quality, soil, and climate monitoring. Further, a prototype for monitoring wastewater treatment is shown, which exemplifies the capabilities of the Wemos board for signal processing. The data are stored in a PostgreSQL database, which enables data mining. The MeteoMex IoT system is highly scalable and of low cost, which makes it suitable for deployment in agriculture 4.0, industries, and public areas.

Sensor-management systems typically perform three fundamental tasks: sample sensors at a specified time or period, save data onto retrievable media, and switch power to components on and off in between sample cycles to conserve battery energy and increase field operation time. These tasks are commonly accomplished through integrating separate off-the-shelf components into the desired system such as: power relays, SD card hardware, Real-Time Clocks (RTCs), and coin cell batteries. To enable faster prototyping, the Openly Published Environmental Sensing Lab abstracted all of these requirements into a single printed circuit board (PCB), Hypnos, that can be included in any project to achieve these commonly-required capabilities: powering on and off connected sensors on a schedule and logging collected data to the removable SD card. The hardware is laid out in a ""Feather"" form factor, a popular configuration in the open-source hardware community, to easily mate with other industry standard products. The onboard RTC acts as an alarm clock that wakes a user-attached microprocessor from low-power sleep modes in between sample cycles.

MRI magnets can be constructed based on permanent neodymium-iron-boron (NdFeB) magnets in discretized arrangements, leading to substantially lower mass and costs. A challenge with these designs is, however, a good B-0 field homogeneity, which is needed to produce high quality images free of distortions. In this work, we describe an iterative approach to build a low-field MR magnet based on a B-0-shimming methodology using genetic algorithms. The methodology is tested by constructing a small bore (inner bore diameter = 130 mm) desktop MR magnet (<15 kg) at a field strength of B-0 = 0.1 T and a target volume of 4 cm in diameter. The configuration consists of a base magnet and shim inserts, which can be placed iteratively without modifying the base magnet assembly and without changing the inner dimensions of the bore or the outer dimensions of the MR magnet. Applying the shims, B0 field inhomogeneity could be reduced by a factor 8 from 5,448 to 682 ppm in the target central slice of the magnet. Further improvements of these results can be achieved in a second or third iteration, using more sensitive magnetic field probes (e.g., nuclear magnetic resonance based magnetic field measurements). The presented methodology is scalable to bigger magnet designs. The MR magnet can be reproduced with off-the-shelf components and a 3D printer and no special tools are needed for construction.

An effective, reusable, locally-manufactured respirator can mitigate this problem. We describe the development, manufacture, and preliminary testing of an open-hardware-licensed device, the ""simple silicone mask"" (SSM). Methods A multidisciplinary team developed a reusable silicone half facepiece respirator over 9 prototype iterations. The manufacturing process consisted of 3D printing and silicone casting. Prototypes were assessed for comfort and breathability. Filtration was assessed by user seal checks and quantitative fit-testing according to CSA Z94.4-18. Results The respirator originally included a cartridge for holding filter material; this was modified to connect to standard heat-moisture exchange (HME) filters (N95 or greater) after the cartridge showed poor filtration performance due to flow acceleration around the filter edges, which was exacerbated by high filter resistance. All 8 HME-based iterations provided an adequate seal by user seal checks and achieved a pass rate of 87.5% (N = 8) on quantitative testing, with all failures occurring in the first iteration. The overall median fit-factor was 1662 (100 = pass). Estimated unit cost for a production run of 1000 using distributed manufacturing techniques is CAD $15 in materials and 20 minutes of labor. Conclusion Small-scale manufacturing of an effective, reusable N95 respirator during a pandemic is feasible and cost-effective. Required quantities of reusables are more predictable and less vulnerable to supply chain disruption than disposables. With further evaluation, such devices may be an alternative to disposable respirators during public health emergencies. The respirator described above is an investigational device and requires further evaluation and regulatory requirements before clinical deployment.

The miniaturization of mass-produced actuators and sensors enables the use of technically extremely complex functions in smartphones at a very low price. They can be used to implement modern microscopy methods for use in places where access to such techniques is often very limited. In this review, we show how easy it is to integrate a smartphone into the everyday microscopy-imaging routines of biology research. Such devices have also been used to identify diseases directly at the patient. Furthermore, we demonstrate how constantly increasing computing power in combination with the steadily improving imaging quality of cameras of handheld devices enables the realization of new biomedical imaging methods, which together with commercially available and 3D-printed components make current research available to a broad mass. Examples are smartphone-based super-resolution microscopy (SRM) or task-specific single-board computer-based devices, which can analyze plankton in sea water.",,

To overcome this limitation with design, this study reports on of a completely 3D-printable planetary roller screw linear actuator. The device is designed as a parametric script-based computer aided design (CAD) package to allow for the easy adaption for a number of applications such as food processing at different scales. The planetary roller screw is fabricated in dishwasher-safe polyethylene terephthalate glycol (PETG) on an open source machine and tested using an open source testing platform to determine if it could maintain a constant load without slipping and the maximum force. Then, this output is compared to a direct screw press using the same materials. The results found that the maximum force is more than doubled for the roller screw actuator using the same materials, making them adequate for some food processing techniques.

To make vacuum drying more accessible, this study provides design and performance information for a small-scale open source vacuum oven, which can be fabricated from off-the-shelf and 3-D printed components. The oven is tested for drying speed and effectiveness on both waste plastic polyethylene terephthalate (PET) and a consortium of bacteria developed for bioprocessing of terephthalate wastes to assist in distributed recycling of PET for both additive manufacturing as well as potential food. Both materials can be damaged when exposed to high temperatures, making vacuum drying a desirable solution. The results showed that the open source vacuum oven was effective at drying both plastic and biomaterials, drying at a higher rate than a hot-air dryer for small samples or for low volumes of water. The system can be constructed for less than 20% of commercial vacuum dryer costs for several laboratory-scale applications, including dehydration of bio-organisms, drying plastic for distributed recycling and additive manufacturing, and chemical processing.",,

However, three decades ago, the medical community started to consider repurposing ultrasound scanners to improve physical examinations. A broad community of healthcare professionals trained in the new clinical examination paradigm could not be created due to the very high price of portable ultrasound scanners available on the market. In this paper, we study an Open-Source Hardware (OSH) community that aims to improve diagnosis in hospitals and medically underserved areas worldwide. They are designing an echo-stethoscope - a portable ultrasound scanner - that would be affordable in low and middle-income countries. The variety of expertise pooled to achieve this objective puts this knowledge common (KC) at the crossroads of open-source software (OSS), OSH, and medical communities. Unlike typical KC outcomes, an ultrasound probe is a physical object. Development and innovation in the physical world bring social dilemmas that the community has to overcome, restrictions in terms of openness, and in this case, unintended privatization. Our study uses the governing knowledge common framework (GKCF), a modified institutional analysis and development framework, to untangle the interactions between resources, participants, and governance structures. Our research describes why and how the creation of a physical object subject to industry regulation influences the evolution and governance of the KC. We provide evidence that temporary privatization of the KC can be used as a way to protect and sustain a common during the industrialization phase. We also demonstrate how a portfolio of projects is an effective and resilient way to help the common survive this privatization step.",,

One popular approach is to measure the movements of restrained animals while presenting controlled sensory stimulation. This approach is especially powerful when applied to genetic model organisms, such as Drosophila melanogaster, where modern genetic tools enable unprecedented access to the nervous system for activity monitoring or targeted manipulation. While there is a long history of measuring the behavior of body- and head-fixed insects walking on an air-supported ball, the methods typically require complex setups with many custom components. Here we present a compact, simplified setup for these experiments that achieves high-performance at low cost. The simplified setup integrates existing hardware and software solutions with new component designs. We replaced expensive optomechanical and custom machined components with off-the-shelf and 3D-printed parts, and built the system around a low-cost camera that achieves 180 Hz imaging and an inexpensive tablet computer to present view-angle-corrected stimuli updated through a local network. We quantify the performance of the integrated system and characterize the visually guided behavior of flies in response to a range of visual stimuli. In this paper, we thoroughly document the improved system; the accompanying repository incorporates CAD files, parts lists, source code, and detailed instructions. We detail a complete ~$300 system, including a cold-anesthesia tethering stage, that is ideal for hands-on teaching laboratories. This represents a nearly 50-fold cost reduction as compared to a typical system used in research laboratories, yet is fully featured and yields excellent performance. We report the current state of this system, which started with a 1-day teaching lab for which we built seven parallel setups and continues toward a setup in our lab for larger-scale analysis of visual-motor behavior in flies. Because of the simplicity, compactness, and low cost of this system, we believe that high-performance measurements of tethered insect behavior should now be widely accessible and suitable for integration into many systems. This access enables broad opportunities for comparative work across labs, species, and behavioral paradigms.",,

Those parameters are assessed objectively with commercial instrumentation such as computer‐assisted sperm analysis systems (CASA) and hemocytometer. In CASA systems, sperm motility is assessed in the horizontal plane imposed by the stage of the microscope. Thus, there is lack of measurement of the vertical velocity of sperm. The female reproductive tract is a tridimensional space which the sperm traverse to reach the ovum, and there is a need for instruments measuring parameters more relevant to this real‐world situation. In this report we describe the design, construction and use of an open‐source hardware (OSH) device for evaluation of the vertical velocity of sperm, called UPSPERM. This device was also used to measure sperm concentration, and agreement with hemocytometer was evaluated. Bland–Altman analysis shows good agreement between these two methods of sperm counting. As a first application of UPSPERM, we evaluated the changes in boar sperm motility at distinct pH values between 7.0 and 8.0. The UPSPERM results showed that the vertical velocity of sperm was highest at pH 7.6 and 7.8.

However, it is already known that shared memory is vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks since mechanisms to check integrity or authenticate callers for the shared memory payload are not supported in TrustZone. While an encryption-based method that resolves this limitation does exist, there are some architectural limitations. Indeed, even with key protection countermeasures applied, there is a risk that encryption keys may be leaked, as they are placed in insecure user memory during communication. Moreover, countermeasures for key leakage cause system performance overhead. In this paper, we propose a lightweight and secure scheme for shared memory, called Software One-Time Programmable Memory (SOTPM). SOTPM is a software-implemented, one-time programmable shared memory. It is based on the idea that payload encryption in the shared memory layer is unnecessary because sensitive data is already encrypted in the application layer before being written to the shared memory. SOTPM is set to read-only after data is written into SOTPM due to the one-time programmable characteristic. Therefore, attackers are unable to manipulate content in SOTPM during communication. Since it is not necessary for SOTPM to encrypt the payload in order to prevent malicious payload manipulation, it is possible to remove the risk of key leakage posed in previous studies. Additionally, in contrast with the existing method, our method can dramatically reduce system performance overhead. We implemented our prototype on an open-source hardware board with an Armv8-A processor and performed a security analysis and performance evaluation. The results show that SOTPM provides a sufficient level of security and less than 1% performance overhead, implying that SOTPM is a reasonable solution for current commercial products.",,

Hardware security tokens effectively prevent most password-related security issues and improve security indisputably. However, we would like to highlight that there are new threats from attackers with physical access which need to be discussed. Supply chain adversaries may manipulate devices on a large scale and install backdoors before they even reach end users. In evil maid scenarios, specific devices may even be attacked while already in use. Hence, we thoroughly investigate the security and trustworthiness of seven commercially available open source security tokens, including devices from the two market leaders: SoloKeys and Nitrokey. Unfortunately, we identify and practically verify significant vulnerabilities in all seven examined tokens. Some of them are based on severe, previously undiscovered, vulnerabilities of two major microcontrollers which are used at a large scale in various products. Our findings clearly emphasize the significant threat from supply chain and evil maid scenarios since the attacks are practical and only require moderate attacker efforts. Fortunately, we are able to describe software-based countermeasures as effective improvements to retrofit the examined devices. To improve the security and trustworthiness of future security tokens, we also derive important general design recommendations.",https://tches.iacr.org/index.php/TCHES/article/download/8972/8550,

IoT gained traction with developers and consumers in recent years, driven by low-cost open-source hardware that enables easy prototyping and testing. IoT must be a part of the educational curriculum in higher education and follow a project-based learning pedagogy. This article describes a teaching framework for embedded systems and IoT, supported by a remote laboratory (RL) to allow students to work on project-based learning. RLs are online environments that let remote users access physical hardware. The hardware is designed as multipurpose multiobjective (MPMO), that is, the hardware components can be reconfigured to suit many different and unrelated learning objectives. RL for IoT benefits from certain advantages. First, IoT activities relating to communication often involve devices set apart geographically; running them as part of a single activity in a Web platform is the most efficient way. Second, some IoT activities require an enormous amount of time before conclusions can be made, and such activities are best carried out through an online environment. Using RL to teach students about embedded systems and IoT allows them to access equipment and IoT scenarios beyond their personal space. It is shown that students have been able to undertake the activities using RL successfully.",,

Spraying during stable atmospheric conditions should be avoided to prevent surface-temperature inversion-induced off-target drift of crop protection materials. Previous statistical analysis determined times of high likelihood of stable atmospheric conditions, which are unfavorable for spraying, during the day under clear and cloudy conditions in hot summer months in the Mississippi Delta. Results validated the thresholds of temperature increase in the morning and temperature drop in the afternoon with wind speeds and the transition between stable and unstable atmospheric conditions. With this information, an algorithm was developed to calculate if atmospheric conditions were favorable for spraying based on field temperature and wind speed at any instant. With this algorithm, a web application was built to provide real-time determination of atmospheric stability and hourly online recommendation of whether aerial applications were appropriate for a location and time in the Mississippi Delta. This study further developed another web application specifically for Stoneville, Mississippi, with data measured from weather stations constructed from inexpensive open-source electronics, accessories, and software for more accurate online guidance for site-specific drift management.

One way of achieving synchronization involves marking distinct events with electrical pulses (event markers or ""TTL pulses""), which are continuously recorded with research hardware, and can later be temporally aligned. Traditionally, this event marking was often performed using the parallel port in standard personal computers. However, the parallel port is disappearing from the landscape of computer hardware, being replaced by a serial (COM) port, namely the USB port. To find an adequate replacement for the parallel port, we evaluated four microcontroller units (MCUs) and the LabJack U3, an often-used USB data acquisition device, in terms of their latency and jitter for sending event markers in a simulated experiment on both Windows and Linux. Our results show that all four MCUs were comparable to the parallel port in terms of both latency and jitter, and consistently achieved latencies under 1 ms. With some caveats, the LabJack U3 can also achieve comparable latencies. In addition to the collected data, we share extensive documentation on how to build and use MCUs for event marking, including code examples. MCUs are a cost-effective, flexible, and performant replacement for the disappearing parallel port, enabling event marking and synchronization of data streams.",,

Whereas these robotic sailboats have good performance with open-source designs, it is actually hard for interested researchers or fans to follow and make their own sailboats with these open-source designs. Thus, in this paper, a generic and flexible unmanned sailboat platform with easy access to the hardware and software architectures is designed and tested. The commonly used 1-m class RC racing sailboat was employed to install Pixhawk V2.4.8, Arduino Mega 2,560, GPS module M8N, custom-designed wind direction sensor, and wireless 433 Mhz telegram. The widely used open-source hardware modules were selected to keep reliable and low-cost hardware setup to emphasize the generality and feasibility of the unmanned sailboat platform. In software architecture, the Pixhawk V2.4.8 provided reliable states' feedback. The Arduino Mega 2,560 received estimated states from Pixhawk V2.4.8 and the wind vane sensor, and then controlled servo actuators of rudder and sail using simplified algorithms. Due to the complexity of introducing robot operating system and its packages, we designed a generic but real-time software architecture just using Arduino Mega 2,560. A suitable line-of-sight guidance strategy and PID-based controllers were used to let the autonomous sailboat sail at user-defined waypoints. Field tests validated the sailing performance in facing WRSC challenges. Results of fleet race, station keeping, and area scanning proved that our design and algorithms could control the 1-m class RC sailboat with acceptable accuracy. The proposed design and algorithms contributed to developing educational, low-cost, micro class autonomous sailboats with accessible, generic, and flexible hardware and software. Besides, our sailboat platform also facilitates readers to develop similar sailboats with more focus on their missions.",,

This is particularly challenging in small animal MRI, as higher heart rates combined with a smaller myocardial mass render routine ECG detection challenging. We have developed an open-hardware system that enables continuously running MRI scans to be performed in conjunction with cardio-respiratory gating such that the relaxation-weighted steady state magnetisation is maintained throughout the scan. This requires that the R-wave must be detected reliably even in the presence of rapidly switching gradients, and that data previously acquired that were corrupted by respiratory motion reacquired. The accurately maintained steady-state magnetisation leads to an improvement in image quality and removes alterations in intensity that may otherwise occur throughout the cardiac cycle and impact upon automated image analysis.

In order to monitor soil salinization in plant physiological experiments, a salinity monitoring system - SProb - was produced to improve our understanding of plant responses to salinity, using open hardware Arduino platform. An experiment was performed and designed to calibrate and check the viability and accuracy of SProb to be used in scientific researches. Salt concentrations were manipulated to identify sensor ability in determining salt accumulation or leaching in soils. Also, two mangrove plant species were grown to identify if root presence would affect soil salt measurements. The soil osmotic potential (psi(s)) was estimated from SProb results and correlated with predawn and midday leaf water potential (psi(l)) of the mangrove plants, to identify if psi(s) would affect plants water regulations. It was also shown that SProb described well the soil salt accumulation or leaching along the time, and the measurements were not affected by the presence of roots. The ranges of psi(s) matched with the range of mangrove psi(l), and the psi(l) decreased with the decrease in psi(s) (increase in salinity). It was confirmed that the SProb sensor is efficient, cheap and has enough accuracy to monitor soil salt concentration. Thus, SProb can be used in plant physiological experiments increasing our ability to make accurate science when such technology is not available in research centers.",,

Subjects: We set the lung model with three conditions of resistance and linear compliance for mimicking different respiratory mechanics of representative intensive care unit (ICU) patients. Interventions: The performance of the device was tested using the ASL5000 lung model. Measurements and Main Results: Twenty-seven conditions were tested. All the measurements fell within the +/- 10% limits for the tidal volume (V-T). The volume error was influenced by the mechanical condition (p = 5.9 x 10(-15)) and the PEEP level (P = 1.1 x 10(-12)) but the clinical significance of this finding is likely meaningless (maximum -34 mL in the error).

This article details the design of an open source gentle ventilator (gentle-vent) framework that can be used in periods of scarcity when no other options are available. The system utilizes a wide range of commonly available components that are combined using basic electronics skills to achieve the desired end product. The firmware is programed in the Arduino IDE using any Arduino compatible microcontroller. The main function of the gentle-vent is to generate a calibrated pressure wave at the pump to provide support to the patient’s breathing. Each gentle-vent permutation was tested using a DIY manometer as it could be done in the field in low-resource settings. These measurements were also verified with an open source VentMon. All permutations were able to accurately hold a desired setpoint for at least 2 hours. The most rudimentary implementation using found mechanical components and perf-board costs less than $20. The results indicate that an open source approach can be used to make breathing support accessible in most contexts.</p>,,

One method for mechanical stimulation of hollow organs, including colon and bladder, are controlled distensions mediated by compressed air. For example, distension of the bladder can be used as an assay for bladder nociception. Bladder distension causes a corresponding increase in abdominal electromyography, which increases with distension pressure and is attenuated with analgesics. However, the hardware used to control these distensions are primarily all one-off custom builds, without clear directions how to build your own. This has made it difficult for these methods to be fully utilized and replicated as not everyone has access, knowledge and resources required to build this controller. Here we show an open-source Arduino based system for controlling a solenoid valve to deliver timed pressure distensions in the experimental model. This device can be controlled by one of two methods through direct TTL pulses from the experimenters data acquisition software (ex. CED Spike2) or by a graphical user interface, where the user can set the time before, during, and after distension as well as the number of cycles.

FruiTemp is an open-source prototype developed to study the response of endophytic insect species such as fruit flies (Diptera: Tephrtidae) to variable temperature conditions including the controlled laboratory and fluctuating field settings. The system is a three-channel temperature sensor that consists of two precision thermistors that measure the temperature in the core and the surface of a fruit on a tree and a Harsh Environment thermistor that measures the air temperature surrounding the host at a rate of one measurement per 15 min. The sample rate can be adjusted according to the researcher's needs. The system was successfully tested in field and laboratory experimental conditions using apples as the fruit model. The measurements on apples on trees lasted five consecutive days and produced a range of reliable data. After assessing statistical agreement and precision, the results revealed a differential bias of 0.331 degrees C and a proportional bias of a magnitude of 0.982. This work promotes open-source implementations allowing inexpensive solutions aiding experimentation procedures by significantly lowering operating costs.",,

LiDAR is usually deployed through manned or unmanned aerial vehicles. As typical payloads are high, an aircraft with LiDAR needs to be significant in size.

It can be applied with much lighter and more affordable aircrafts and its use to provide extensive terrain datasets is steadily increasing. The scalable open-source software OpenDroneMap allows for extending datasets to very large amounts.

Barring a few recent papers, there is limited consensus on which algorithms are effective at this scale vis-\`a-vis their hardware cost. This competition compares ANNS algorithms at billion-scale by hardware cost, accuracy and performance. We set up an open source evaluation framework and leaderboards for both standardized and specialized hardware. The competition involves three tracks. The standard hardware track T1 evaluates algorithms on an Azure VM with limited DRAM, often the bottleneck in serving billion-scale indices, where the embedding data can be hundreds of GigaBytes in size.

Traditionally, the volume of such measurements has been limited by the high cost of commercially available instruments. An increasingly attractive solution to this cost issue is to use instruments produced in-house from open-source hardware, firmware, and postprocessing building blocks. In the present work, we release the next iteration of our open-source drifter and wave-monitoring instrument, which follows these solution aspects. The new design is significantly less expensive (typically by a factor of 5 compared with our previous, already cost-effective instrument), much easier to build and assemble for people without specific microelectronics and programming competence, more easily extendable and customizable, and two orders of magnitude more power-efficient (to the point where solar panels are no longer needed even for long-term deployments). Improving performance and reducing noise levels and costs compared with our previous generation of instruments is possible in large part thanks to progress from the electronics component industry. As a result, we believe that this will allow scientists in geosciences to increase by an order of magnitude the amount of in situ data they can collect under a constant instrumentation budget. In the following, we offer (1) a detailed overview of our hardware and software solution, (2) in situ validation and benchmarking of our instrument, (3) a fully open-source release of both hardware and software blueprints. We hope that this work, and the associated open-source release, will be a milestone that will allow our scientific fields to transition towards open-source, community-driven instrumentation. We believe that this could have a considerable impact on many fields by making in situ instrumentation at least an order of magnitude less expensive and more customizable than it has been for the last 50 years, marking the start of a new paradigm in oceanography and polar science, where instrumentation is an inexpensive commodity and in situ data are easier and less expensive to collect.",,

While others have studied the importance of data, hardware, and models in directing the trajectory of AI, we argue that open source software is a neglected factor shaping AI as a discipline. We start with the observation that almost all AI research and applications are built on machine learning open source software (MLOSS). This paper presents three contributions. First, it quantifies the outsized impact of MLOSS by using Github contributions data. By contrasting the costs of MLOSS and its economic benefits, we find that the average dollar of MLOSS investment corresponds to at least \$100 of global economic value created, corresponding to \$30B of economic value created this year. Second, we leverage interviews with AI researchers and developers to develop a causal model of the effect of open sourcing on economic value. We argue that open sourcing creates value through three primary mechanisms: standardization of MLOSS tools, increased experimentation in AI research, and creation of communities. Finally, we consider the incentives for developing MLOSS and the broader implications of these effects. We intend this paper to be useful for technologists and academics who want to analyze and critique AI, and policymakers who want to better understand and regulate AI systems.",,

The use of DIY technology is already widespread, particularly in countries with limited access to science funding, and is catalyzing the development of open-source technologies. Beyond financial accessibility, open hardware can be transformational for the access of laboratories to equipment by reducing dependence on import logistics and enabling direct knowledge transfer. Central drivers to the adoption of appropriate open-source technologies in biology laboratories around the world are open sharing, digital fabrication, local production, the use of standard parts, and detailed documentation.

An open-hardware ultrasound scan set-up has been engineered to increase the availability of acoustic imaging significantly. Using this set-up, three cells that were aged and clamped at different pressures have been imaged. The resulting ultrasound image clearly showed which parts of the cells have more severely aged than others. The cells which were clamped with the highest examined pressure (5 and 10 bar) showed the strongest covering layer and gas formation in the ultrasound scan. The mechanical effect of the aging seen in the ultrasound image was verified for each cell by conventional electrical and post-mortem analysis. At locations where the ultrasound image showed distinct irregularities, scanning electron microscopy images identified mossy surface layers typical for lithium plating.",,

In this paper, we propose strategies for the placement of CU and DU network functions in the regional and edge O-Cloud nodes while jointly associating the users to RUs. The aim is to minimize the end-to-end delay of users and minimize the cost of O-RAN deployment. Thus, we first formulate the end-to-end delay, the cost, and the constraints. We then model the problem as a multi-objective optimization problem The optimization formulation consists of a huge number of constraints and variables. To provide a solution to the problem, we develop the corresponding Markov Decision Problem (MDP) and propose a Deep Q-Network (DQN)-based algorithm.

Some sensors deployed for these purposes such as temperature, relative humidity, atmospheric pressure, and carbon dioxide sensors require protection from climate factors to avoid bias. Radiation shields hold and protect sensors to avoid this bias, but commercial systems are limited, often expensive, and difficult to implement in low-cost contexts or large deployments for collaborative sensing. To overcome these challenges, this work presents an open source, easily adapted and customized design of a radiation shield. The device can be fabricated with inexpensive off-the-shelf parts and 3-D printed components and can be adapted to protect and isolate different types of sensors. Two material approaches are tested here: polylactic acid (PLA), the most common 3-D printing filament, and acrylonitrile styrene acrylate (ASA), which is known to offer better resistance against UV radiation, greater hardness, and generally higher resistance to degradation. To validate the designs, the two prototypes were installed on a custom outdoor meteorological system and temperature and humidity measurements were made in several locations for one month and compared against a proprietary system and a system with no shield. The 3-D printed materials were also both tested multiple times for one month for UV stability of their mechanical properties, their optical transmission and deformation under outdoor high-heat conditions. The results showed that ASA is the preferred material for this design and that the open source radiation shield could match the performance of proprietary systems. The open source system can be constructed for about nine US dollars, which enables mass development of flexible weather stations for monitoring needed in smart agriculture.(c) 2022 The Author(s).

The station measures relative humidity, temperature, atmospheric pressure, precipitation, wind speed, and light radiation. In addition, the system monitors the charge state of the main battery and the energy generated by the photovoltaic module to act as a reference cell for solar energy generation capability and agrivoltaic potential in the installation area. The station can be remotely controlled and reconfigured. The collected data from all sensors can be uploaded to the cloud in realtime.

Two kinds of nodes compose the proposed architecture; these are the so-called: (1) smart IEQ sensor nodes, responsible for acquiring indoor environmental measures locally, and (2) the IEQ concentrators, responsible for collecting the data from smart sensor nodes distributed along the facilities. The IEQ concentrators are also responsible for configuring the acquisition system locally, logging the acquired local data, analyzing the information, and connecting to cloud applications. The presented architecture has been designed using low-cost open-source hardware and software-specifically, single board computers and microcontrollers such as Raspberry Pis and Arduino boards. WiFi and TCP/IP communication technologies were selected, since they are typically available in corporative buildings, benefiting from already available communication infrastructures. The application layer was implemented with MQTT. A prototype was built and deployed at the Faculty of Engineering of Vitoria-Gasteiz, University of the Basque Country (UPV/EHU), using the existing network infrastructure.

EIS results from the developed potentiostat were validated with a commercial benchtop potentiostat by comparing impedance magnitude and phase values along the EIS frequency range. In addition, an experimental design was performed for detecting S100B in spiked human plasma samples with S100B concentrations of clinical utility, and a calibration curve was found for quantifying S100B detection. No statistically significant differences were found between EIS results from the developed potentiostat and the commercial potentiostat. Statistically significant differences in the changes in charge transfer resistance signal between each tested S100B concentration (p < 0.05) were found, with a limit of detection of 35.73 pg/mL.

Lack of reliable quality management tools has impeded repository development in the past several decades. Microfabricated open-hardware devices have emerged as a new approach to assist repository development by providing standardized quality assessment capabilities to enable routine quality control. However, prototyping of microfabricated devices (microdevices) traditionally relies on photolithography techniques that are costly, time intensive, and accessible only through specialized engineering laboratories. Although resin 3-D printing has been introduced into the microfabrication domain, existing publications focus on customized or high-cost (>thousands of USD) printers. The goal of this report was to identify and call attention to the emerging opportunities to support innovation in microfabrication by use of low-cost (<USD 350) resin 3-D printing for rapid prototyping. We demonstrate that low-cost mask-based stereolithography (MSLA) 3-D printers with straightforward modifications can provide fabrication quality that approaches traditional photolithography techniques. For example, reliable feature sizes of 20 <mu>m with dimensional discrepancy of <4% for lateral dimensions and <5% for vertical dimensions were fabricated with a consumer-level MSLA printers. In addition, alterations made to pre-processing, post-processing, and printer configuration steps improved print quality as demonstrated in objects with sharper edges and smoother surfaces. The prototyping time and cost of resin 3-D printing (3 h with USD 0.5/prototype) were considerably lower than those of traditional photolithography (5 d with USD 80/prototype). With the rapid advance of consumer-grade printers, resin 3-D printing can revolutionize rapid prototyping approaches for microdevices in the near future, facilitating participation in interdisciplinary development of innovative hardware to support germplasm repository development for aquatic species.",,

Agile hardware design tools based on compiler techniques can help by quickly producing an application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) accelerator starting from a high-level algorithmic description.

A better understanding of the mechanical properties of 3-D printing thermoplastics at cryogenic temperatures is essential to material selection, part design, and printing optimization. The goal of the present study was to explore the feasibility of development for a 3-D printed device ('CryoTensileDevice') to hold a test specimen in liquid nitrogen and be mounted in standard mechanical testing systems to evaluate 3-D printing material behaviors at cryogenic temperatures. The CryoTensileDevice was prototyped with flexible filaments with a per-unit material cost of <US$5 and a printing time of 5 h. The commonly used printing filament polylactic acid (PLA) was selected to evaluate the utility of the CryoTensileDevice. At room temperature, the CryoTensileDevice did not significantly (P 0.05) affect PLA tensile measurements such as Young's modulus, yield stress, yield strain, stress at break, or strain at break. With the CryoTensileDevice, specimens 3-D printed with PLA at 50%, 75%, and 100% infill rates had comparable tensile properties when tested at room and liquid nitrogen temperatures. The PLA showed superior performance in tensile properties in comparison to acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS). This device can assist characterization of 3-D printing approaches for cryogenic work, and opens a pathway for future innovations to create a variety of 3-D printed devices to study a wide range of material properties for cryogenic applications.",,

In this methodology, first the target country that is threatening national security or safety is identified. Next, the top imports from the target country as well as potentially other importing countries (allies) are quantified. Hardware is identified that could undercut imports/exports from the target country. Finally, methods to support the FOSH development are enumerated to support production in a commons-based peer production strategy. To demonstrate how this theoretical method works in practice, it is applied as a case study to a current criminal military aggressor nation, who is also a fossil-fuel exporter.

Medical devices play an important role in managing acute and chronic respiratory failure, including diagnosis, monitoring, and providing artificial ventilation. Current commercially available respiratory devices are very effective but, given their cost, are unaffordable for most patients in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). Herein, we focus on a relatively new design option—the open-source hardware approach—that, if implemented, will contribute to providing low-cost respiratory medical devices for many patients in LMICs, particularly those without full medical insurance coverage. Open source reflects a set of approaches to conceive and distribute the comprehensive technical information required for building devices. The open-source approach enables free and unrestricted use of the know-how to replicate and manufacture the device or modify its design for improvements or adaptation to different clinical settings or personalized treatments. We describe recent examples of open-source devices for diagnosis/monitoring (measuring inspiratory/expiratory pressures or flow and volume in mechanical ventilators) and for therapy (non-invasive ventilators for adults and continuous positive airway pressure support for infants) that enable building simple, low-cost (hence, affordable), and high-performance solutions for patients in LMICs.

Design/methodology/approach This hardware was designed to be compatible with a Graber i3-based 3D printer; nevertheless, it can be easily adapted to other open-source 3D printers. Findings The extrusion head successfully deposits the material during the 3D printing process. It was validated fabricating geometries that include scaffold structures, which are a possible application of bioprinting for tissue engineering. As reported, the extruded filaments allowed the porous samples' structuration. Practical implications This system expands the applications of open-source 3D printers used at the laboratory scale. It enables low-cost access to research areas such as tissue engineering and biofabrication, energy storage devices and food 3D printing. Originality/value The open-source hardware here reported is of simple fabrication, assembly and installation. It uses a Cardan coupling and a three guides system to transfer the stepper motor motion. This approach allows continuous movement transfer to the syringe piston, producing an adequate deposition or retraction. Thus, the effect of misalignments is avoided, considering that these latter can cause skipping steps in the motor, directly affecting the deposition.",,

Because it is additive, it enables geometries usually unattainable by other technologies. Because it is digitally controlled, its output is easily modulated, even during operation. Combined with the development of functional materials and their micrometer precision, it can be applicable in a wide range of fields beyond the traditional graphic industry, such as medical diagnosis, electronics manufacturing, and the fabrication of microlenses. In this work, a solution based on open-source hardware and software was implemented instead of choosing a commercial alternative, making the most of inkjet flexibility in terms of inks, substrates, and actuation signal. First, a piezoelectric printhead from MicroFab, driven by an ArduinoDue, was mounted in a 3D printer adapted to ensure precise movement in three dimensions. Then, a monitoring system using a USB digital microscope and a computational algorithm was integrated. Both systems combined allow the printing and measurement of microdroplets by digital regulation of a unipolar signal. Finally, based on a theoretical model and a set of experimentally collected samples, the curve that relates the unipolar signal amplitude to the size of the microdroplets was estimated with an acceptable range of prediction uncertainty.",,

Due to the severity of these attacks, manufacturers deploy hardware-based fault defenses into security-critical systems, such as secure elements. The development of these countermeasures is a challenging task due to the complex interplay of circuit components and because contemporary design automation tools tend to optimize inserted structures away, thereby defeating their purpose. Hence, it is critical that such countermeasures are rigorously verified post-synthesis. Since classical functional verification techniques fall short of assessing the effectiveness of countermeasures (due to the circuit being analyzed when no faults are present), developers have to resort to methods capable of injecting faults in a simulation testbench or into a physical chip sample. However, developing test sequences to inject faults in simulation is an error-prone task and performing fault attacks on a chip requires specialized equipment and is incredibly time-consuming. Moreover, identifying the fault-vulnerable circuit is hard in both approaches, and fixing potential design flaws post-silicon is usually infeasible since that would require another tape-out. To that end, this paper introduces SYNFI, a formal pre-silicon fault verification framework that operates on synthesized netlists. SYNFI can be used to analyze the general effect of faults on the input-output relationship in a circuit and its fault countermeasures, and thus enables hardware designers to assess and verify the effectiveness of embedded countermeasures in a systematic and semi-automatic way. The framework automatically extracts sensitive parts of the circuit, induces faults into the extracted subcircuit, and analyzes the faults’ effects using formal methods. To demonstrate that SYNFI is capable of handling unmodified, industry-grade netlists synthesized with commercial and open tools, we analyze OpenTitan, the first opensource secure element. In our analysis, we identified critical security weaknesses in the unprotected AES block, developed targeted countermeasures, reassessed their security, and contributed these countermeasures back to the OpenTitan project. For other fault-hardened IP, such as the life cycle controller, we used SYNFI to confirm that existing countermeasures provide adequate protection.",https://tches.iacr.org/index.php/TCHES/article/download/9813/9318,

However, many individuals with hearing loss are dissatisfied with the quality of modern hearing aids. Amplification is the main method of compensating for hearing loss in modern hearing aids. One common amplification technique is dynamic range compression, which maps audio signals onto a person's hearing range using an amplification curve. However, due to the frequency dependent nature of the human cochlea, compression is often performed independently in different frequency bands. This paper presents a real-time multirate multiband amplification system for hearing aids, which includes a multirate channelizer for separating an audio signal into eleven standard audiometric frequency bands, and an automatic gain control system for accurate control of the steady state and dynamic behavior of audio compression as specified by ANSI standards. The spectral channelizer offers high frequency resolution with low latency of 5.4 ms and about 14x improvement in complexity over a baseline design. Our automatic gain control includes a closed-form solution for satisfying any designated attack and release times for any desired compression parameters. The increased frequency resolution and precise gain adjustment allow our system to more accurately fulfill audiometric hearing aid prescriptions.",,

Here we present Maasi, an affordable alternative that is easy to build and has all functional key features to be used in a wide range of applications. Our design has a price of less than hundred Euros and an assembly time of only two hours. One of the key design principles was to use only 3D printed parts in combination with affordable Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) components [1]. Reducing the complexity we use an electronic speed controller (ESC) with telemetry, to eliminate the need for a rotor position sensor [2]. A touchscreen further improves its usability, thus setting a perfect startpoint for the design of other affordable lab tools. The Maasi project includes different 3D printable substrate holders allowing treatment of formats up to 80 mm in diameter. We furthermore validate the Maasi spin coater by measuring its speed accuracy and performance for coating polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) on glass coverslips for mechanobiological assays.

Between crops, weeds are typically controlled by applying herbicides or tillage to the entire field. However, these control methods are expensive and can pose environmental risks. Robotic weeding systems are a good solution to minimize environmental impact and save money on herbicides, but they are expensive (>$100,000). The Weed Warden is a low-cost (<$200) plant detection sensor that can be mounted on rovers or tractors. The Weed Warden uses an open source multispectral sensor to detect live vegetation and sends a logic signal that could trigger a weed removal system such as a sprayer or mechanical tillage when vegetation is detected. We evaluate the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Enhanced Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (ENDVI), and Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI), for producing a value that, combined with a calibrated threshold, will indicate if there is plant life under the sensor. The Weed Warden system using ENDVI is most consistent at detection, with the ability to discriminate 7.6x7.6 cm vegetation samples from bare soil at sensor heights of 30 and 41 cm from the ground.

This work developed a low-cost standardized artificial inseminator device (SAID) as open hardware to address issues routinely encountered in insemination by mouth-pipetting, including lack of reproducibility among different users, difficulty in training, and large, unreportable variation in sample volume and pressure during insemination.

Prototypes of the SAID were designed as relatively inexpensive (<USD 80) open hardware based on commercially available and 3-D printed components to enable broad community access. A linear actuator was used to accurately control the position of a piston for fluid transfer with a standard deviation of <0.1 mm over a 4 mm range of travel. The volume of sample transfer was precisely controlled with a linear relationship (r(2) > 0.99) between the piston position and volume. Pressure generation from eight mouth-pipetting operators and SAID prototypes were assessed by pressure sensors. The pressure control by SAID was superior to that produced by mouth-pipetting, yielding lower pressures (31-483 Pa) and smaller variations (standard deviation <11 Pa). These pressures were sufficient to deliver 1-5 mu L of fluid into female reproductive tracts yet low enough to avoid physical injury to fish.

That approach is applied here to make surgical tables more accessible. This study describes the design and manufacture of an open source surgical fracture table that uses materials that are widely available worldwide with specialty components being 3-D printed. The bill of materials and assembly instructions are detailed and the fracture table is validated to perform mechanically to specifications. Using an open source desktop RepRap-class 3-D printer, the components can be printed in a little over a week of continuous printing. Including the 3-D printed parts, the open source fracture table can be constructed for under US$3,000 in material costs, representing a 98.5% savings for commercial systems, radically increasing accessibility. The open source table can be adjusted 90-116 cm in height, tilted from +/-15 degrees, the leg height ranges from 31 to 117 cm, the arm supports and foot holder both have a 180-degree range, the foot position has a 54 cm range, and the legs can be adjusted from 55 to 120 degrees. It is mechanically adjusted so does not require electricity, however, surgical staff need to be trained on how to perform needed adjustments during surgery. The open source surgical table has verified performance for mechanical loading over 130 kg, geometric flexibility to allow for wide array of common surgeries, is radiolucent in surgical zones, and is modular and upgradeable.",,

More people than ever-from artists, makers and entrepreneurs to educators and students-are connecting microcontrollers with sensors and actuators to create new interactive devices. However, physical computing still presents many challenges and demands many skills, spanning electronics, low-level protocols, and software-road blocks that reduce participation. While USB has made connecting peripherals to a personal computing device (PC) trivial, USB components are expensive and require a PC to operate. This makes USB impractical for many physical computing scenarios where cost, size and low power operation are often important. We introduce Jacdac, an open-source hardware and software platform that brings the user experience of USB to physical computing at a fraction of the cost and resource requirements. It combines an intuitive connector, standardized hardware and software interfaces, a simple bus-based protocol that runs on virtually any microcontroller, and integration with Microsoft MakeCode for the micro:bit. In this way, Jacdac provides a low-cost, extensible web-based plug-and-play experience for physical computing. We evaluated Jacdac in an international hackathon involving over 80 participants who built functional artifacts with Jacdac. Interviews reveal that users find Jacdac intuitive and appreciate the plug-and-play experience where sensors and actuators are automatically discovered by the web browser in real-time.",,

Not only does soil moisture represent the water available for plant growth but also water table levels can affect crop productivity. Furthermore, monitoring soil saturation and water table levels is essential for an early warning of extreme rainfall situations. However, the measurement of these parameters employing commercial instruments has certain disadvantages, with a high cost of purchase and maintenance. In addition, the handling of commercial devices makes it difficult to adapt them to the specific requirements of farmers or decision-makers. Open-source IoT hardware platforms are emerging as an attractive alternative to developing flexible and low-cost devices. This paper describes the design of a datalogger device based on open-source hardware platforms to register water table levels and soil moisture data for agronomic applications. The paper begins by describing energy-saving and wireless transmission techniques. Then, it summarizes the linear calibration of the phreatimeter sensor obtained with laboratory and field data. Finally, it shows how non-linear machine-learning techniques improve predictions over classical tools for the moisture sensor (SKU: SEN0193).",,

In this paper, collected by a motorized telescope mount was data analyzed using both video observations by trained observers and modernized approaches using computer vision. The more advanced data extraction used the OpenCV library of computer vision tools to identify bird silhouettes by means of image stabilization and background subtraction. The silhouettes were sanitized and analyzed in sequence to produce stacked relationships between temporally close contours, discriminating birds from noise based on the assumption that birds migrate in stable paths. The flight ceiling of the birds was determined by extracting relevant correlation coefficient data from doppler radar co-located with the LunAero instrument in Norman, OK, USA using a method with low-computational overhead. The bird paths and flight ceiling were combined with lunar ephemera to provide input for the original method used for nocturnal migration quantification as well as an enhanced version of the same method with more advanced computational tools. We found that the manual quantification of migration activity detected 16,300 birds/km center dot h heading northwest from 110 degrees, whereas the automated analysis reported a density of 43,794 birds/km center dot h heading northwest from 106.67 degrees. Hence, there was agreement with regard to flight direction, but the automated method overestimated migration density by approximately three times. The reasons for the discrepancy between flight path detection appeared to be due to a substantial amount of noise in the video data as well as a tendency for the computer vision analysis to split single flight paths into two or more segments. The authors discuss ongoing innovations aimed at addressing these methodological challenges.",,

New physicians could not complete training at the pace of ventilator production, which threatened to leave patients sitting untreated, next to unusable ventilators. To address this challenge, we developed a universal remote control system for makeshift ventilators that uses low-cost hardware add-on modules to connect to different ventilators, and a three-tier control architecture to interface the ventilators with telemedicine software.

To facilitate mass collaboration and accelerate progress, many groups have adopted open-source development models, inspired by the long history of open-source development in software. According to the Open-source Hardware Association (OSHWA), Open-source Hardware (OSH) is a term for tangible artifacts - machines, devices, or other physical things - whose design has been released to the public in such a way that anyone can make, modify, and use them. One major obstacle to translating the growing body of work on open-source ventilators into clinical practice is compliance with regulations and conformance with mandated technical standards for effective performance and device safety. This is exacerbated by the inherent complexity of the regulatory process, which is tailored to traditional centralized development models, as well as the rapid changes and alternative pathways that have emerged during the pandemic. As a step in addressing this challenge, this paper provides developers, evaluators, and potential users of emergency ventilators with the first iteration of a pragmatic, open-source assessment framework that incorporates existing regulatory guidelines from Australia, Canada, UK and USA. We also provide an example evaluation for one open-source emergency ventilator design. The evaluation process has been divided into three levels: 1. Adequacy of open-source project documentation; 2.

This is due to both the complex and interconnected data required for product design and manufacture, and to the centralised computing infrastructure traditionally used to manage product lifecycle data. While modern cloud-based solutions to collaborative design are gaining popularity, they diminish the control of each design partner. In contrast, software designers readily collaborate on highly complex software, while retaining direct control of the files they are editing due to the dominance of distributed version control. Distributed version control for software is often coupled with 'Developer Operations' or DevOps tools to automate critical processes and facilitate communication. This paper explores how DevOps workflows can be adapted for open development of hardware. An example of how DevOps for hardware (HardOps) can be implemented is provided by the OpenFlexure Microscope project. While much ground remains to be broken in this field, HardOps can support a new paradigm of distributed hardware development, with enormous benefits not only for open-source hardware, but also commercial hardware.",,

The detection of glyphosate residues in waters is not a simple task, as it requires complex and expensive equipment and qualified personnel. New technological tools need to be designed and developed, based on proven, but also cost-efficient, agile, and user-friendly, analytical techniques, which can be used in the field and in the lab, enabled by connectivity and multiplatform software applications.

In this sense, the do-it-yourself (DIY) approach to build new low-cost systems or verify the correspondence of low-cost systems compared to professional devices allows the spread of application possibilities. Following this trend, the authors aim to present a complete DIY and replicable procedure to evaluate the performance of a low-cost video luminance meter consisting of a Raspberry Pi and a camera module. The method initially consists of designing and developing a LED panel and a light cube that serves as reference illuminance sources. The luminance distribution along the two reference light sources is determined using a Konica Minolta luminance meter. With this approach, it is possible to identify an area for each light source with an almost equal luminance value. By applying a frame that covers part of the panel and shows only the area with nearly homogeneous luminance values and applying the two systems in a dark space in front of the low-cost video luminance meter mounted on a professional reference camera photometer LMK mobile air, it is possible to check the discrepancy in luminance values between the low-cost and professional systems when pointing different homogeneous light sources. In doing so, we primarily consider the peripheral shading effect, better known as the vignetting effect. We then differentiate the correction factor S of the Radiance Pcomb function to better match the luminance values of the low-cost system to the professional device. We also introduce an algorithm to differentiate the S factor depending on the light source. In general, the DIY calibration process described in the paper is time-consuming. However, the subsequent applications in various real-life scenarios allow us to verify the satisfactory performance of the low-cost system in terms of luminance mapping and glare evaluation compared to a professional device.",,

This study aimed to design and test a cheap and easy-to-build negative pressure device and provide its detailed open-source description, thereby enabling free replication. Methods: the negative pressure device was built using off-the-shelf materials available via e-commerce and was based on a small pump, a pressure transducer, and the simplest Arduino controller with a digital display (total retail cost <= 75 US$). The device allows the user to set any therapeutic range of intermittent negative pressure and has two independent safety mechanisms. The performance of the low-cost device was carefully tested on the bench using a phantom wound, producing a realistic exudate flow rate. Results: the device generates the pressure patterns set by the user (25-175 mmHg of vacuum pressure, 0-60 min periods) and can drain exudate flows within the clinical range (up to 1 L/h). Conclusions: a novel, low-cost, easy-to-build negative pressure device for wound healing displays excellent technical performance.

These differences challenge the degree of applicability of existing project success definitions in the OSH context. To investigate project success in OSH, we conducted a qualitative survey with practitioners. We report characteristics of successful OSH projects through three identified themes: (a) value creation - the big-picture impact, (b) quality of output - the quality of the hardware and accompanying documentation and (c) project process - activities that contribute to success. We contextualise by comparing OSH with selected literature on the success of OSS and NPD project management.

Toward this goal, data-flow integrity (DFI) is employed as a strict security policy for enforcing the legitimacy of each data access, thereby filtering out most of the attack exploits. However, due to the intensive computations needed by DFI, there are only limited proposals successfully implementing partial DFI with low performance overhead. Moreover, all the previous studies failed to enforce the complete DFI policy in a real hardware platform, while trading off security strength for performance efficiency. To provide RISC-V architecture with high security enforcement and low performance overhead, we leverage the open-source Rocket Chip and propose RvDfi, the first complete DFI implementation based on RISC-V architecture with only 17.8% performance overhead on average and 3.9% in minimum, incurring much less performance loss compared to the 166.3% overhead caused by previous complete DFI implementation.",,

Drifters have the potential of facilitating the monitoring and modeling of river behavior at a fraction of traditional monitoring costs. They are floating objects equipped with sensors able to passively follow the movements of water. During their travel, they collect and transmit information about their movement and their surrounding environment. In this paper, we present and assess a low-cost (<150 EUR) customizable drifter developed with off-the-shelf components. The open drifter is capable of handling the majority of use cases defined in the specialized literature and in addition it offers a general river flow characterization toolkit. One of the main goals of this work is to establish an open hardware and software basis to increase the use of drifters in river studies. Results show that the proposed drifter provides reliable surface velocity estimates when compared to a commercial flow meter, offering a lower cost per data point and in contrast to traditional point measurements it can be used to identify and classify large-scale surface flow patterns. The diverse sensor payload of the open drifter presented in this work makes it a new and unique tool for autonomous river characterization.",,

To this end, it provides an easily usable task-based programming abstraction, and combines this with powerful tool support to automatically implement the individual hardware accelerators and integrate them into usable system-on-chips. Currently, TaPaSCo relies on the host to manage task parallelism and perform the actual task launches. However, for more expressive parallel programming patterns, such as pipelines of task farms, the round trips from the hardware accelerators back to the host for launching child tasks, especially when exploiting data-dependent execution times, quickly add up. The major contribution of this work is the addition of on-chip task scheduling and launching capabilities to TaPaSCo. This enables not only low-latency dynamic task parallelism, it also encompasses the efficient on-chip exchange of parameter values and task results between parent and child accelerator tasks. For larger distributed systems, the dynamic launch capability can even be extended over the network to span multiple FPGAs. Our solution is able to handle recursive task structures, and is shown to achieve latency reductions of over 35x compared to the prior approaches.",,

Sophisticated microscopes allowing optical sectioning for three-dimensional imaging or sub-diffraction resolution are available. Due to price and maintenance issues, these microscopes are often shared between users in facilities. Consequently, long-term access is often prohibited and does not allow to monitor slowly evolving biological systems or to validate new models like organoids. Preliminary coarse long-term data that do not require acquisition of terabytes of high-resolution images are important as a first step. By contrast with expensive all-in-one commercialized stations, standard microscopes equipped with incubator stages offer a more cost-effective solution despite imperfect long-run atmosphere and temperature control. Here, we present the Incubascope, a custom-made compact microscope that fits into a table-top incubator. It is cheap and simple to implement, user-friendly and yet provides high imaging performances. The system has a field of view of 5.5 x 8 mm(2), a 3 mu m resolution, a 10 frames per second acquisition rate, and is controlled with a Python-based graphical interface. We exemplify the capabilities of the Incubascope on biological applications such as the hatching of Artemia salina eggs, the growth of the slime mould Physarum polycephalum and of encapsulated spheroids of mammalian cells.",,

As a result of this research, an IoT system based on open hardware and software tools was built, which is articulated within the conventional 4-layer IoT architecture (capture, storage, analysis, and visualization). With respect to the existing solutions, the advantage of this system is the use of portable SBC platforms, as well as the inclusion of machine learning models within the analysis layer.

This article tries to unpack how, after an exhibition on sexual health norms, a feminist hacklab was attacked by local right-wing and conservative politicians. The attack resulted in the defunding of the feminist hacklab. But it also started a transformation process within the collective, as members became aware of critical interferences of diffracting marginalisations. The crisis triggered a discussion on how each member was threatened to very different degrees; for example, there was more at stake for members depending on their legal status in the country. The right-wing and conservative campaign against the feminist hacklab damaged the initiative, but at the same time it pushed the collective to generate increased vehemence and resilience.",,

Open hardware and 3-D printing were used to facilitate animal husbandry, sperm handling, and cryopreservation. Hydractinia sperm at a concentration of 2 x 10(7) cells/mL stored at 4 degrees C for as long as 6 d were able to achieve 50% fertilization rate. A fertilization rate of 41-69% was observed using sperm equilibrated with 5, 10, or 15% (v/v) cryoprotectant (dimethyl sulfoxide or methanol) for 20 min, cooled at a rate of 5, 10, or 20 degrees C/min from 4 degrees C to -80 degrees C, at a cell concentration of 1 x 10(8) sperm/mL, in 0.25 mL French straws.

Hydractinia symbiolongicarpus is an emerging model organism in which cutting-edge genomic tools and resources are being developed for use in a growing number of research fields. One limitation of this model system is the lack of long-term storage for genetic resources. The goal of this study was to establish a generalizable cryopreservation approach for Hydractinia that would support future repository development for other cnidarian species. Specific objectives were to: (1) characterize basic parameters related to sperm quality; (2) develop a generalizable approach for sperm collection; (3) assess the feasibility of in vitro fertilization (IVF) with sperm after refrigerated storage; (4) assess the feasibility of IVF with sperm cryopreserved with various sperm concentrations; (5) evaluate feasibility of cryopreservation with various freezing conditions, and (6) explore the feasibility of cryopreservation by use of a 3-D printed open-hardware (CryoKit) device. Animal husbandry and sperm collection were facilitated by use of 3-D printed open hardware. Hydractinia sperm at a concentration of 2 x 10(7) cells/mL stored at 4 degrees C for 6 d were able to achieve 50% fertilization rate. It appeared that relatively higher sperm concentration (>5 x 10(7) cells/mL) for cryopreservation could promote fertilization. A fertilization rate of 41-69% was observed using sperm equilibrated with 5, 10, or 15% (v/v) cryoprotectant (dimethyl sulfoxide or methanol) for 20 min, cooled at a rate of 5, 10, or 20 degrees C/min from 4 degrees C to -80 degrees C, at a cell concentration of 10(8)/mL, in 0.25 mL French straws. Samples cryopreserved with the CryoKit produced a fertilization rate of 72-82%.

This current practice of releasing water from reservoirs causes flash floods in downstream areas and increases the likelihood of dam failures and public outrage. Pre-release of water from reservoirs is therefore an important strategy for downstream flood mitigation. Hydrological models can simulate river flow with sufficient lead time. Thus, the resulting outputs can be effectively applied to pre-release decision making in the reservoirs. Since the beginning of computer-aided applications, many attempts have been made to establish a decision support system for reservoir flood control. However, this is hampered by manual stations, low quality data, high cost of software and data, unknown parameter values, and lack of expertise, especially in developing countries. Therefore, a total open-source solution combined with low-cost open-source hardware, free and open-source software, and open standards was seen as the only way to overcome reservoir-related flood risk. Moreover, research studies on open-source hardware, software, standards, and data are limited to a few case studies reporting real-time data on certain environmental parameters. Therefore, the application of integrated open-source technologies for reservoir flood control remains an unexplored area. In this background, a hydrological model powered by integrated open-source technology is presented in this research for reservoir pre-release decision making. The model was tested for the Deduru Oya watershed using the SWAT (Soil and Water Assessment Tool) toolkit. The calibration results appear to be satisfactory for both daily and hourly time intervals. Thus, this model helps to simulate the inflow of the reservoir and determine the level of reservoir gate opening.",,

It includes at least prohibition of cartels — agreements between undertakings and concerted practices — of abuse of dominant position or ‘monopolization’, and merger control. These areas of antitrust differ considerably. Cartels require the coordinated effort of more than one undertaking, whereas abuse of dominant position is in principle a practice committed by a single undertaking. Enforcement of cartel and abuse of dominant position rules mostly apply ex post facto, when the illegal practices have displayed some of their effects. Conversely, merger control happens before a merger between two undertakings has become effective, requiring notification of certain deals before they are consummated, therefore it is mostly ex ante and it requires a notable amount of forward-looking evaluation by the antitrust authorities.",https://academic.oup.com/book/chapter-pdf/54406751/oso-9780198862345-chapter-17.pdf,

However, the software stack for blockchain systems which build on top of these protocol layers is very complex and varies based on the blockchain system. The protocol layers, such as Bitcoin and Ethereum, are sometimes referred to as ‘Layer 1’ or the ‘base layer’. Some blockchain systems also have ‘Layer 2’ software such as the ‘Lightening Network’ for Bitcoin.

This ability requires the nervous system to undergo adjustments at distinct temporal scales, from short-term dynamic changes in expression of neurotransmitters and receptors to longer-term growth, spatial and connectivity reorganization, while integrating external stimuli. The nematode Caenorhabditis elegans provides a model of nervous system plasticity, in particular its dauer exit decision. Under unfavorable conditions, larvae will enter the non-feeding and non-reproductive stress-resistant dauer stage and adapt their behavior to cope with the harsh new environment, with active reversal under improved conditions leading to resumption of reproductive development. However, how different environmental stimuli regulate the exit decision mechanism and thereby drive the larva's behavioral change is unknown. To fill this gap and provide insights on behavioral changes over extended periods of time, we developed a new open hardware method for long-term imaging (12h) of C. elegans larvae.Results: Our WormObserver platform comprises open hardware and software components for video acquisition, automated processing of large image data (> 80k images/experiment) and data analysis. We identified dauer-specific behavioral motifs and characterized the behavioral trajectory of dauer exit in different environments and genetic backgrounds to identify key decision points and stimuli promoting dauer exit. Combining long-term behavioral imaging with transcriptomics data, we find that bacterial ingestion triggers a change in neuropeptide gene expression to establish post-dauer behavior.Conclusions: Taken together, we show how a developing nervous system can robustly integrate environmental changes activate a developmental switch and adapt the organism's behavior to a new environment. WormObserver is generally applicable to other research questions within and beyond the C. elegans field, having a modular and customizable character and allowing assessment of behavioral plasticity over longer periods.",,

The perceived time investment and unknown cost, especially in implementing open source hardware, has stagnated the implementation of inexpensive experimental solutions, but we sought to increase awareness to lower the barrier to participation in this space. While there are countless technical and financial advantages to integrating open source solutions into every biologist's experimental design, we put an emphasis on the ""people"" part of the equation in our symposium. This symposium championed innovative experimental designs by early career Society for Integrative and Comparative Biology researchers across all fields of biology, from plants to animals, in the lab or in the field, or even virtually engaging with the public and students. The Open Science movement operates within community norms that champion transparency, continuous development, and collaboration.

However, for the market segment of stand-alone, self-sustaining small IoT nodes, long-term deployment remains problematic due to the energy-constrained nature of these devices, requiring frequent maintenance. This article introduces Hypnos, an open hardware and software toolkit that aims to balance energy intake and usage through the adaptive sensing rate for low-cost Internet-connected IoT nodes. We describe the hardware architecture of the IoT node, an open hardware board based on the Arduino Uno form-factor packing the energy measurement circuitry, and the associated opensource software library, which interfaces with the sensing node's microcontroller and provides access to the low-level energy measurements. Hypnos comes equipped with a built-in, configurable, modified sigmoid function to regulate duty-cycle frequency based on energy intake and usage, yet developers may also plug in their custom duty/sleep balancing function. An experiment was set up, whereby two identical boards ran for two months: one with the Hypnos software framework and built-in energy-balancing function to regulate sensing rate and the other with fixed sensing rate. The experiment showed that Hypnos is able to successfully balance energy usage and sensing frequency within configurable energy ranges. Hereby, it increases the reliability by avoiding the complete shutdown, while, at the same time, optimizing performance in terms of the average amount of sensor measurements.",,

Based on the increasing interest in open-source hardware and relying on the non-proprietary RISC-V specification, in this work we aim to explore architectural extensions serving as a baseline for establishing a Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) in microcontroller-class processor cores targeted at embedded and industrial applications, especially those with some form of latency-sensitive requirements. We point out that supporting a trusted environment in this type of systems is particularly challenging and we identify a minimum set of hardware-level protection mechanisms, with limited assumptions on the available privileged modes and protection support. The reference architecture is demonstrated by extending a lightweight RISC-V core, Ibex. As shown in the last part of our work, the proof-of-concept design achieves flexible support for isolation at a modest overhead in terms of additional hardware resources and delay, thereby fully matching the constraints of latency-sensitive deeply embedded applications.",,

The results found that all but one of the nuclear states would have a significant economic disincentive to start a nuclear attack if the proposal was put into force. Payback times ranged from 1.2 to 40 years, where the entire GDP of a nuclear aggressor would be needed to offset the loss for aggression, indicate such a mechanism as a whole would be an effective nuclear deterrent. This method would not be universally effective without ensuring all nuclear states are members of the international economy and IP processes.

Their systems are operated with a very low level of automatization and monitoring causing inefficient operation, water loss or even interruption of service. The Internet of Things concept is very promising to realize a cost-effective tool for monitoring and control of water systems. The potential of this approach is investigated in the research project IoT.H2O funded in the WaterJPI call IC4WATER. In the paper, the concept of the IoT system for monitoring and control of water supply systems is explained. Special gateways and IoT devices have been developed which communicate with the IoT platform by the LoRaWAN network protocol or WiFi. It is shown how a pump test rig can be controlled with these devices. Also, results of field installations in a water distribution system in Germany are presented. Moreover, it is shown how data from existing SCADA systems and results from network simulations with EPANET can be included in the IoT system and how the data can be processed and evaluated by the IoT platform.

Historically, open source software’s clear economic advantages over proprietary software caused a gain in market share, despite previous bias towards proprietary software. To achieve its full potential both requires a level playing field and a sufficiently large user base. Governments have a clear role to play in the creation of a level playing field. The public sector meanwhile can choose to be pro-active in its support for open source software, or merely to be neutral so that there are, at least, no barriers to the procurement of open source, or, to demonstrate a bias towards particular proprietary solutions. Whatever the policy, there are both obligations and limits on what a public authority can do as part of the procurement process: for public procurement sits within a framework of international and local laws.",https://academic.oup.com/book/chapter-pdf/54406764/oso-9780198862345-chapter-21.pdf,

Unfortunately, the commercial MEW device's prohibitive affordability and lack of standardization of custom devices, represent obstacles to further research. Built on the achievements and affordability of material extrusion 3D printers, we convert an open-source Voron 0.1 printer into a highly capable MEW device, termed as MEWron. To guarantee availability, the use of commercial and affordable components is prioritized, while in the cases where this has not been possible, 3D printed, and easy-to-machine components have been employed. Two main approaches have been followed, the first one focused on the existing material extrusion configuration (i.e., filament-based feeding system and material input) while the second one focuses on a conventional MEW pneumatic feeding system and syringe reservoir. When not including the high voltage supply, both approaches have a final budget below $1000. The manuscript describes all required steps and components to modify a Voron 0.1 printer and provides the computer-aided design (CAD) for required custom components reproduction.

Yet, global plastics production has quadrupled in 40 years and only 9 % has been recycled. If these trends continue, carbon emis-sions from plastic wastes would reach 15 % of global carbon budgets by 2050. An approach to reducing plastic waste is to use distributed recycling for additive manufacturing (DRAM) where virgin plastic products are replaced by locally manufactured recycled plastic products that have no transportation-related carbon emissions. Unfortunately, the design of most 3-D printers forces an increase in the machine cost to expand for recycling plastic at scale. Recently, a fused granular fabrication (FGF)/fused particle fabrication (FPF) large-scale prin-ter was demonstrated with a GigabotX extruder based on the open source cable driven Hangprinter concept. To further improve that system, here a lower-cost recyclebot direct waste plastic extruder is demonstrated and the full designs, assembly and operation are detailed. The <$1,700 machine's accuracy and printing performance are quantified, and the printed parts mechanical strength is within the range of other systems. Along with sup-port from the Hangprinter and DUET3 communities, open hardware developers have a rich ecosystem to modify in order to print directly from waste plastic for DRAM.(c) 2023 The Author(s).

Based on the model and the BLE specification for spur emission, a requirement for the PLL fractional spurs is derived. To meet the derived spectral mask by reducing the fractional spurs, a novel synthesizable two-step time to digital converter (TSTDC) that employs embedded TDC (EMBTDC) as coarse and Vernier delay-line TDC (DLTDC) as fine TDC is proposed. We also present a digital calibration scheme to compensate for the nonlinearity induced by the place-and-route (P&R) tool. The PLL is fabricated in 12-nm FinFET and demonstrated in a BLE-TX. The measured BLE transmissions satisfy the standard requirements thanks to the reduced fractional spurs. In a standalone PLL mode, the proposed TSTDC and calibration scheme reduced the fractional spurs by 14.3 dB compared to only using an EMBTDC in near integer N operation. The PLL supports a frequency range of 1.8-2.7 GHz and consumes 3.91 mW at 2.4006 GHz achieving figure of merit (FoM) of -220.7 dB in fractional-N mode with a 40 MHz reference, occupying an area of 0.063 mm(2). A highly automated design flow is used for the PLL to lower the barrier for new developers and reduce the porting cost.",,

The NRCP system consists of a PC controller equipped with MATLAB/Simulink software and an embedded target designed with open-source hardware, e.g., Raspberry Pi and STM32. Therefore, it benefits from the following advantages, such as simple structure, low cost, convenient deployment, and robust scalability. In order to verify the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed NRCP, a networked magnetic levitation control system (NMLCS) is developed on the basis of this NRCP system. Furthermore, a discrete-time equivalent-input-disturbance (DEID)-based model predictive control approach is proposed for NMLCS to deal with the common practical issues in NCSs, such as time delay and disturbance. Specifically, the time delay is modeled as delay-induced disturbance (DID), whose influence is effectively estimated and eliminated by the designed controller. Several experimental case studies are performed to verify the effectiveness of the NRCP, the DEID-based control algorithm, and the analytical method of DID.",,

An automated high-throughput protocol was developed demonstrating the synthesis of CdSe nanocrystals using sonochemistry and different combinations of sample conditions, including precursor and ligand compositions and concentrations. Cavitation caused by ultrasound fields causes local and transient increases in temperature and pressure sufficient to drive the decomposition of organometallic precursors to drive the chemical reaction leading to nanocrystal formation. A total of 625 unique sample conditions were prepared and analyzed in triplicate with an individual sample volume of as little as 0.5 mL, which drastically reduced chemical waste and experimental times. The rapid onset of cavitation and quick dissipation of energy result in fast nucleation with little nanocrystal growth leading to the formation of small nanocrystals or magic-size clusters (MSCs) depending on composition. Using the effective mass approximation, the calculated QD diameters obtained under all our experimental conditions ranged between 1.3 and 2.1 nm, which was also validated with small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS). Polydispersity, QD shape and optical properties largely varied depending on the concentration of ligands present in solution. Statistical analysis of the spectroscopic data corroborates the qualitative relationships observed from the optical characterization of the samples with the model-agnostic SHAP analysis. The complete workflow relies on relatively low-cost and open-source systems. Automation and the reduced volumes also allow for cost-efficient experimentation, increasing the accessibility of this MAP. The high-throughput capabilities of the automated sonication platform, the extensible nature of the Jubilee system, and the modular nature of the protocol, make the workflow adaptable to a variety of future studies, including other nanocrystal design spaces, emulsification processes, and nanoparticle re-dispersion or exfoliation. A sonochemical Materials Acceleration Platform was implemented to synthesize CdSe nanocrystals under 625 unique conditions (in triplicate) in less than 6 weeks.

This high price of entry makes such technology prohibitively expensive for many research groups. Such systems stand to benefit the emerging academic pharmaceutical field by providing the experience and availability of reliable and affordable solutions. To implement accessible flow chemistry at research facilities, the systems must be made affordable. In addition, space in research laboratories is usually limited and commercially available flow systems can be very bulky. Having a compact and individually adjustable system is thus beneficial, with 3D printing technology offering the solution. Our compact 3D-printed system meets the needs of many applications in flow chemistry research as well as educational requirements for universities.

Methods: Forty-eight cylindrical-shaped specimens (10 x 2 mm) were prepared with a nano-hybrid RBC (Clearfil Majesty ES-2) and randomly divided in four groups according to the experimental staining procedure: G1) static immersion in a staining solution (coffee) (44 +/- 1 degrees C); G2) staining cycling between coffee (44 +/- 1 degrees C) and distilled water (37 +/- 1 degrees C) with an experimental staining machine based on Arduino, an Open Source hardware development platform; G3) staining cycles as in G2 + brushing with a low abrasive toothpaste (Relative Dentin Abrasion RDA = 30) (Elmex Sensitive Professional); G4) staining cycles as in G3, with brushing performed with a very strong abrasive toothpaste (RDA = 90) (Lacult Active). Color parameters were recorded at the baseline (T0) after staining procedures (T1) and repolishing (T2) using a spectrophotometer. Color change ( increment E00) and translucency (TP, CR) were evaluated. Data were statistically analyzed (p < 0.05). Results: For increment E00 after staining, Group 1 showed the highest color change and Group 3 the lowest. All groups were significantly different (p < 0.001) except for Group 2 vs. Group 4; after repolishing, Group 1 was significantly higher than Group 3 (p < 0.001), Group 2 (p < 0.001), and Group 4 (p = 0.003); Group 2 was higher than Group 3 (p < 0.001). For TP variable, after staining procedures, Group 2 was significantly higher than all other groups (p < 0.001), and Group 1 was significantly higher than Group 3 (p < 0.001) and Group 4 (p = 0.007). After repolishing, Group 4 was significantly lower than Group 3 (p = 0.008) and Group 2 (p = 0.027). Repolishing procedure significantly reduced color parameters. Conclusions: The investigated staining procedure induced significant differences in color stability and translucency. The use of a very strong abrasive toothpaste (RDA = 90) induced higher color change than a low abrasive one (RDA = 30). Repolishing procedures are able to partially reduce color change induced by artificial staining procedures.",,

Threats to ecosystems can go undetected for years or decades as a result. Real-time data can help solve this issue but significant technical barriers exist. For example, automated camera traps are widely used for ecosystem monitoring but it is challenging to transmit images for real-time analysis where there is no reliable cellular or WiFi connectivity. We modified an off-the-shelf camera trap (Bushnell (TM)) and customised existing open-source hardware to create a 'smart' camera trap system. Images captured by the camera trap are instantly labelled by an artificial intelligence model and an 'alert' containing the image label and other metadata is then delivered to the end-user within minutes over the Iridium satellite network. We present results from testing in the Netherlands, Europe, and from a pilot test in a closed-canopy forest in Gabon, Central Africa. All reference materials required to build the system are provided in open-source repositories. Results show the system can operate for a minimum of 3 months without intervention when capturing a median of 17.23 images per day. The median time-difference between image capture and receiving an alert was 7.35 min, though some outliers showed delays of 5-days or more when the system was incorrectly positioned and unable to connect to the Iridium network. We anticipate significant developments in this field and hope that the solutions presented here, and the lessons learned, can be used to inform future advances.

Understanding inequality as a representation problem is valuable but does not necessarily unpack its mechanisms. Using an epistemic justice lens, I look at scientific instruments as sites of inequality by design in environmental studies. Even when in recent years we have seen an explosion of new scientific tools in the field, how these tools reproduce inequalities is underexplored. The open science hardware movement provides an opportunity for studying this question in practice. I present findings from qualitative research with two projects of the Gathering for Open Science Hardware (GOSH) community in Latin America during 2018-2022. These findings show how researchers use open science hardware to overcome structural inequalities in environmental research. Beyond their lower cost, researchers are using open hardware to enable new ideas and concepts to emerge through flexible and repairable designs. I describe four mechanisms that enable the creation of new epistemic resources: autonomy, flexibility, impact and resilience, and I identify significant limitations to this potential. In the context of ongoing policy discussions promoting wider adoption of low-cost environmental research tools, this work provides insights for seizing the transformative potential of openness towards more fair environmental science.",,

The combination of accessible hardware and high-performance deep learning (DL) tools for plant analysis is becoming widely recognised as a path forward for both plant science and applied precision agricultural purposes. Yet, a lack of collaboration in image analysis for plant science, despite the open-source origins of much of the technology, is hindering development. Here, we show how tools developed for specific attributes of phenotyping or weed recognition for precision weed control have substantial overlapping data structure, software/hardware requirements and outputs. An open-source approach to these tools facilitates interdisciplinary collaboration, avoiding unnecessary repetition and allowing research groups in both basic and applied sciences to capitalise on advancements and resolve respective bottlenecks. The approach mimics that of machine learning in its nascence. Three areas of collaboration are identified as critical for improving efficiency, (1) standardized, open-source, annotated dataset development with consistent metadata reporting; (2) establishment of accessible and reliable training and testing platforms for DL algorithms; and (3) sharing of all source code used in the research process. The complexity of imaging plants and cost of annotating image datasets means that collaboration from typically distinct fields will be necessary to capitalize on the benefits of DL for both applied and basic science purposes.",https://academic.oup.com/aobpla/advance-article-pdf/doi/10.1093/aobpla/plad010/49467881/plad010.pdf,

Fault rates increase in turn and become more concerning, particularly at the scale of High-Performance Computing (HPC) systems: on one hand, hardware fault protection is costly - more than 10% silicon area for floating-point units; on the other, HPC users expect correct application output after the anticipated time of computation, but workloads are seldom bit-reproducible and tolerances in output are allowed for. Benign hardware faults causing errors within these tolerances are therefore acceptable: however, with abstract reliability targets such as 'undetected failures per time,' current HPC system design does not allow for pursuing trade-offs between reliability and performance with respect to faults. To address the above, we propose a user-centric reliability benchmark to specify HPC system reliability targets, allowing for better performance optimizations in hardware design, while meeting HPC user expectations. Our open-source Hardware Design Fault Injection Toolkit (HDFIT) enables - for the first time - end-to-end hardware design reliability experiments: from netlist-level fault injection to application output error. In a proof of concept we present an HPC general matrix multiply (GEMM) reliability study, targeting a series of popular applications, and using HDFIT to benchmark an open-source GEMM accelerator.",,

In most of these instruments, sample injection is effected manually with low to moderate precision and requires skilled operators. Although few automated samplers have been previously developed, typically only one sample at a time can be injected. If a series of samples is to be analyzed, manual intervention is required. In the present work, we developed and constructed a fully automated, open source, CE autosampler, able to handle up to 14 different samples that can be used as a modular component of any in-house built CE instrument. Results: An inexpensive, 3D printed, open source, autosampler for CE was developed. The autosampler consists of two parts: an injection unit with carousel containing sample and electrolyte vials and a flushing unit, containing a miniature pressure/vacuum pump. The autosampler is operated by an Arduino Mega microcontroller and an Arduino code written in the laboratory. The injection sequence is entered through a keypad and LCD display by the user. The instrument can operate autonomously for extended periods of time. It was used for fully automated analysis and/or calibration of up to 14 samples with excellent injection repeatability reaching less than 2.7% RSD for peak areas. The sampler performance was tested with two independently built CE instruments, a CE system with contactless conductivity detection (C4D) and a CE system with laser induced fluorescence (LIF) detector.Significance and novelty: A novel, 3D printed, Arduino-based autosampler for CE was developed. The autosampler allows autonomous hydrodynamic injection of up to 14 different samples with fully programmable injection sequence, including capillary flushing and high voltage and data acquisition control. It provides the missing instrumental sampling setup for laboratory made CE instruments. It can be simply constructed based on the open -source blueprints in any laboratory and be a useful and time-saving add-on to any modular CE instrument.",,

The sensor is a first at a cost of less than USD 50, which is well suited to previously cost-prohibited high-resolution monitoring schemes. This use case is further supported by its out-of-water operation, which provides low-effort installations and longer maintenance-free intervals when compared with in-water sensors. The inclusion of both velocity and depth measurement capabilities allows the sensor to also be used as an all-in-one solution for flowrate measurement. We discuss the design of the sensor, which has been made freely available under open-hardware and open-source licenses. The design uses commonly available electronic components, and a 3D-printed casing makes the design easy to replicate and modify.

The question of using renewable energy sources is also essential for the sustainability of wireless sensor networks and the Industrial Internet of Things, especially in scenarios where there is a need to deploy an extensive number of sensor nodes and smart devices in industrial environments. Because of that, this paper targets the problem of monitoring the operations of solar-powered wireless sensor nodes applicable for a variety of Industrial IoT environments, considering their required locations in outdoor scenarios and the efficient solar power harvesting effects. This paper proposes a distributed wireless sensor network system architecture based on open-source hardware and open-source software technologies to achieve that. The proposed architecture is designed for acquiring solar radiation data and other ambient parameters (solar panel and ambient temperature, light intensity, etc.). These data are collected primarily to define estimation techniques using nonlinear regression for predicting solar panel voltage outputs that can be used to achieve energy-efficient operations of solar-powered sensor nodes in outdoor Industrial IoT systems. Additionally, data can be used to analyze and monitor the influence of multiple ambient data on the efficiency of solar panels and, thus, powering sensor nodes. The architecture proposal considers the variety of required data and the transmission and storage of harvested data for further processing. The proposed architecture is implemented in the small-scale variants for evaluation and testing. The platform is further evaluated with the prototype sensor node for collecting solar panel voltage generation data with open-source hardware and low-cost components for designing such data acquisition nodes. The sensor node is evaluated in different scenarios with solar and artificial light conditions for the feasibility of the proposed architecture and justification of its usage. As a result of this research, the platform and the method for implementing estimation techniques for sensor nodes in various sensor and IoT networks, which helps to achieve edge intelligence, is established.",,

Guidelines for the management of the elder with falls are comprised of multidimensional assessments, especially gait and balance.

This work presents the clinical validation of the G-STRIDE system, a 6-axis inertial measurement unit (IMU) with onboard processing algorithms, that allows the calculation of walking-related metrics correlated with clinical markers of fall risk. A cross-sectional case-control study was conducted with 163 participants (falls and non-falls groups). All volunteers were assessed with clinical scales and conducted a 15-min walking test at a self-selected pace while wearing the G-STRIDE. G-STRIDE is a low-cost solution to facilitate the transfer to society and clinical evaluations. It is open hardware and flexible and, thus, has the advantage of providing runtime data processing. Walking descriptors were derived from the device, and a correlation analysis was conducted between walking and clinical variables. G-STRIDE allowed measuring walking parameters in non-restricted walking conditions (e.g. hallway). Walking parameters statistically discriminate between falls and non-falls groups. We found good/excellent estimation accuracy (ICC = 0.885; p < 0.000 ) for walking speed, showing good/excellent correlation between gait speed and several clinical variables. G-STRIDE can calculate walking-related metrics that allow for discrimination between falls and non-falls groups, which correlates with clinical indicators of fall risk.

The traditional, design-limiting periodicity in material design is overcome by utilizing Wang tiles to achieve compatibility among building blocks. We illustrate our approach with the design and manufacturing of an L-shaped domain inspired by a scissor-like soft gripper, whose internal module distribution was optimized to achieve an extreme tilt of a tip of the gripper's jaw when the handle part was uniformly compressed. The geometry of individual modules was built on a 3 x 3 grid of elliptical holes with varying semi-axes ratios and alternating orientations. We optimized the distribution of the modules within the L-shaped domain using an enumeration approach combined with a factorial search strategy. To address the challenge of seamless interface connections in modular manufacturing, we produced the final designs by casting silicone rubber into modular molds automatically assembled by a robotic arm. The predicted performance was validated experimentally using a custom-built, open-hardware test rig, Thymos, supplemented with digital image correlation measurements.

This paper demonstrates, characterizes and evaluates an inexpensive and versatile system for the detection of fluorophores with two wavelengths using high power LEDs. The LEDs are arranged in two banks angled downward at a tray in a way that allows for bright and uniform illumination while preventing direct reflections into the camera. The emitted light is filtered through an exchangeable filter frame and can be detected using the camera of a smartphone or similar device. By using filters both in front of the LEDs and the camera, very low background and using sufficient exposure times, very high sensitivity can be achieved.

However, a common belief is that the greater economic cost and complexity of hybrid digital objects (i.e., digital objects with both hardware and software) precludes their development with open source methods traditionally used for software. We study a sophisticated OSH named White Rabbit initiated at CERN and developed through a vibrant and heterogenous open source community. Our findings show that the assumption that hardware and software require fundamentally distinctive development and production modes should be replaced with a more nuanced differentiation characterized by three main attributes describing an object's composition: embodiment, modularity, and granularity. Taken together, these three attributes determine how a hybrid object is developed throughout its evolution in an open source community. Our research offers several contributions. First, we provide a more nuanced view of the consequences of the material embodiment of hardware. Once considered a simple deterrent to open source development, we describe how economic cost is subordinate to more influential aspects of an object's physical layers: as the open source community modifies the object to accommodate the operating requirements of diverse physical instantiations, such modifications can be incorporated in the logical design covered by the open source license. Additionally, we show how embodiment, modularity, and granularity progress through the object's evolution and how this maturation subsequently affects development modes. We trace the implications of our findings for hybrids and digital object conceptualizations in IS research, open source development and, more broadly, normative implications for OSH in scientific and commercial computing.",,

There is anecdotal evidence that these opportunities are heavily geographically dependent, with some locations unable to acquire components to build open hardware at accessible prices because of trade restrictions, tariffs, taxes, or market availability. Supply chain disruptions during the COVID-19 pandemic exacerbated this and forced designers to pivot towards a la carte-style design frameworks for critical system components. To further develop this phenomenon, a case study of free and open-source solar photovoltaic (PV) racking systems is provided. Two similar open-source designs made from different materials are compared in terms of capital costs for their detailed bill of materials throughout ten locations in North, Central and South America. The differences in economic optimization showed that the costs of wood-based racks were superior in North America and in some South American countries, while metal was less costly in Central and South America.

Most of these training modules simplify the development environment, for example, by using LEGO bricks or playing cards. This oversimplification has been shown to result in limited transferability of learning to industrial practice. Furthermore, there is a lack of teaching modules that specifically address the challenges of applying Agile to physical products. In this paper, we present an open‐source educational game that realistically simulates a hardware development project to teach Agile principles. Over 2 days, participants design, manufacture, and test modifications for a physical wire bending machine within an authentic engineering and production setting. The training mimics the typical roles, processes, and tools of industrial engineering teams to reflect the challenges of Agile hardware development. The module was evaluated with 44 industry professionals regarding perceived learning and user reaction. A combination of quantitative and qualitative methods was used for the experimental evaluation. The results showed a positive learning effect as the participants' average agreement with Agile principles increased through the training. Concerning user reaction, respondents reported a high degree of relevance, interaction, and confidence, indicating that the realistic simulation of the hardware development appropriately balanced the degree of realism with simplicity. The study showcases the opportunities of properly aligning game components to provoke learning situations targeted by the instructors. It contributes to the extant literature by providing a design framework (product, process, setting, and instruction) and open‐source access to the tools used for implementation.",https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/cae.22616,

Materials and method A field survey is conducted to identify the requirements of users so as to choose specific features and design constraints for the WC. In this multipurpose self-propelled model, a temporarily detachable circular section is fitted in the seat position to access the water closet bowl. This hinged portion can be released by gravity before reaching above the closet basin. After the toilet usage, the circular lid can be brought back to the initial seating using a lever mechanism and a spring-loaded lock restrains its downward movement. Thereafter, it can be used as an ordinary WC for indoor applications. Moreover, a small wheel with 22 in diameter and removable hand-rests ensured the transferability between utilities. A CAD model is prepared and numerical simulation is performed to verify the structural stability of the design. Results The optimized model is fabricated using standard manufacturing practices and is delivered to different persons with disabilities to collect user feedback.

The growth rate of leaves at different growth stages determines the overall LAI, which is used by crop growth models (CGM) for simulating yield. Consequently, precise phenotyping of the leaves can help elucidate phenological processes relating to resource capturing. A stable system for acquiring images and a strong data processing backend play a vital role in reducing throughput time and increasing accuracy of calculations, compared to manual analysis. However, most available solutions are not dynamic, as they use color-based segmentation, which fails to capture leaves with varying shades and shapes. We have developed a system that uses a low-cost setup to acquire images and an automated pipeline to manage the data storage on the device and in the cloud. The system is powered by virtual machines that run multiple custom-trained deep learning models to segment out leaves, calculate leaf area (LA) for the whole set and at the individual leaf level, overlays important information on the images, and appends them on a compatible file used for CGMs with very high accuracy. The pipeline is dynamic and can be used for multiple crops. The use of open-source hardware, platforms, and algorithms makes this system affordable and reproducible.",,

The instrument is a 7-band spectrophotometer equipped with a microprocessor that allows one to acquire the reflectance spectrum of samples and compute up to 9 vegetation indices.

Additionally, open-source hardware and field-programable gate arrays (FPGAs) are gaining traction via newly developed tools, frameworks, and HDLs. This enables new methods of creating hardware and systems faster, more simply, and more efficiently. In this paper, the implementation of a system-on-chip (SoC) based on a 32-bit RISC-V processor with lightweight cryptographic accelerator cores in FPGA and an open-source integrating framework is presented. The system consists of a 32-bit VexRiscv processor, written in SpinalHDL, and lightweight cryptographic accelerator cores for the PRINCE block cipher, the PRESENT-80 block cipher, the ChaCha stream cipher, and the SHA3-512 hash function, written in Verilog HDL and optimized for low latency with fewer clock cycles. The primary aim of this work was to develop a customized SoC platform with a register-controlled bus suitable for integrating lightweight cryptographic cores to become compact embedded systems that require encryption functionalities. Additionally, custom firmware was developed to verify the functionality of the SoC with all integrated accelerator cores, and to evaluate the speed of cryptographic processing. The proposed system was successfully implemented in a Xilinx Nexys4 DDR FPGA development board. The resources of the system in the FPGA were low with 11,830 LUTs and 9552 FFs.

Currently, many emerging contaminants are difficult to measure with no field deployable sensors currently available. Hence, discrete grab samples are required for subsequent laboratory analysis. To capture the spatiotemporal variability in pollution pulses, autosamplers can be used, but commercial offerings are both expensive and have a large footprint. This can be problematic in urban environments where there is a high density of point source inputs and risk of vandalism or theft. Here, we present a small and robust low-cost autosampler that is ideally suited for deployment in urban environments. The design is based on ""off the shelf"" open-source hardware components and software and requires no prior engineering, electronics, or computer programming experience to build. The autosampler uses a small peristaltic pump to enable collection of 14 small volume samples (50 mL) and is housed in a small footprint camera case. To illustrate the technology, we present two use cases for rapid sampling of stormwater pulses of: 1) an urban river channel and 2) green roof runoff. When compared with a commercial autosampler, our device showed comparable results and enabled us to capture temporal dynamics in key water quality parameters (e.g., dissolved organic matter) following rain events in an urban stream. Water quality differences associated with differing green roof design/maintenance regimes (managed and unmanaged vegetation) were captured using the autosampler, highlighting how unmanaged vegetation has a greater potential for mitigating the rapid runoff and peaked pollutant inputs associated with impervious surfaces. These two case studies show that our portable autosampler provides capacity to improve understanding of the impact of urban design and infrastructure on water quality and can lead to the development of more effective mitigation solutions. Finally, we discuss opportunities for further technical refinement of our autosampler and applications to improve environmental monitoring. We propose a holistic monitoring approach to address some of the outstanding challenges in urban areas and enable monitoring to shift from discrete point sources towards characterization of catchment or network scale dynamics.",,

This approach enables the remote acquisition of information on Lagrangian transport and important ocean variables, similar to standard drifters. However, it offers potential benefits such as reduced hardware costs, minimal maintenance expenses, and significantly lower power consumption compared to systems relying on independent drifters with satellite communication. By combining low power consumption with an optimized, compact integrated marine photovoltaic system, the drifters achieve unlimited operational autonomy. With the introduction of these new characteristics, the Smart Drifter Cluster goes beyond its primary function of mesoscale monitoring of marine currents. It becomes readily applicable to numerous civil applications, including recovering individuals and materials at sea, addressing pollutant spills, and tracking the dispersion of marine litter. An additional advantage of this remote monitoring and sensing system is its open-source hardware and software architecture.

Development of aquatic germplasm repositories is impeded by a lack of standardization within laboratories and across the research community. Protocols for cryopreservation are often developed ad hoc and without close attention to variables, such as cell concentration, that strongly affect the success and reproducibility of cryopreservation. The wide dissemination and use of specialized tools and devices as open hardware can improve processing reliability and save costs. The goal of the present work was to develop and prototype a modular and open-technology approach to help to standardize the cell concentration of germplasm samples prior to cryopreservation. The specific objectives were to: 1) design and fabricate prototypes of the automated concentration measurement and adjustment system (CMAS), incorporating custom peristaltic pumps and optical evaluation modules, and 2) evaluate the performance of the CMAS with biological samples. Linear regression models were obtained for estimation of aquatic sperm concentration > 10 8 cells/mL and for algae concentration > (3 x 10 5 ) cells/mL. Algae were diluted with extender medium by an automated process, resulting in a dilution precision of +/- 12.6% and +/- 6.7% in two trials, attaining means of 89% and 71% of the target cell concentration.

The results of the analysis show that, in most cases, Arduino boards present hardware and software limitations and security vulnerabilities, probably due to their low-cost requirement design. Some examples are: an easy-to-override firmware, lack of power protection or nonencrypted board communications in the case of Arduino Yun. Also, Arduino does not check bad use of memory stack, so bad memory operations may end up easily on memory corruption and unexpected behavior. All these limitations and vulnerabilities may lead to security breaches on the deployed environment. Therefore, any security management policy must take these weaknesses into account.",,

Through this type of surgery, one can place needles among other tools within the structures of the brain. Therefore, injections can be given in order to deliver substances that cannot cross the blood-brain barrier. The two most important parameters of the microinjection to control are volume and speed. The volume should not be so large that it displaces the brain tissue and tears it. The injection speed must also be slow so that the liquid that comes out of the syringe can diffuse into the tissue without displacing it and damaging it. Thus, the objec-tives of the present work are: 1) To develop not a 3D printed prototype but an end-user device. 2) The device must be for animal research only. 3) It must have the same precision in volume and speed as commercial devices. 4) It must be adjustable for microsyringes from 0.5 ll to 1 ml. 5) It must be possible to place it directly on the stereotaxic surgery apparatus and to use it separately. 6) The price must be substantially lower than that of the commercial devices.& COPY; 2023 The Authors.

One area that requires improved supply chain resilience and that is of particular importance to electronic designers is the shortage of basic dual in-line package (DIP) electronic components commonly used for prototyping. This anecdotal observation was investigated as a case study of using additive manufacturing to enforce contact between premade, off-the-shelf conductors to allow for electrical continuity between two arbitrary points by examining data relating to the stock quantity of electronic components, extracted from Digi-Key Electronics. This study applies this concept using an open hardware approach for the design, testing, and use of a simple, parametric, 3-D printable invention that allows for small outline integrated circuit (SOIC) components to be used in DIP package circuits (i.e., breadboards, protoboards, etc.). The additive manufacture breakout board (AMBB) design was developed using two different open-source modelers, OpenSCAD and FreeCAD, to provide reliable and consistent electrical contact between the component and the rest of the circuit and was demonstrated with reusable 8-SOIC to DIP breakout adapters. The three-part design was optimized for manufacturing with RepRap-class fused filament 3-D printers, making the AMBB a prime candidate for use in distributed manufacturing models. The AMBB offers increased flexibility during circuit prototyping by allowing arbitrary connections between the component and prototyping interface as well as superior organization through the ability to color-code different component types. The cost of the AMBB is CAD $0.066/unit, which is a 94% saving compared to conventional PCB-based breakout boards. Use of the AMBB device can provide electronics designers with an increased selection of components for through-hole use by more than a factor of seven. Future development of AMBB devices to allow for low-cost conversion between arbitrary package types provides a path towards more accessible and inclusive electronics design as well as faster prototyping and technical innovation.",,

Aquatic environmental DNA (eDNA) has emerged as a promising approach to identify organisms in freshwater and marine environments. While the recovery of eDNA from water most commonly involves capture of biological debris on a filter matrix, practitioners are yet to converge on standardized approaches for filtration, particularly in the field. This lack of standardization has resulted in inconsistent handling of samples following collection, limiting interpretation of results across studies and burdening groups with inconvenient storage and transport logistics that may compromise eDNA integrity.Methods. A simple to assemble and low-cost ($350 USD) water filtration system is demonstrated that can be used in field and laboratory settings to reduce time between sample acquisition and eDNA filtration, maximizing eDNA sample recovery. Quantitative PCR is used to show the utility of the platform for laboratory and marine eDNA analysis.Results. The resulting eDNA collection system is easily transported in a rugged water-resistant case, operates for more than eight hours on a 12-volt lead-acid battery, and has an unobstructed filtration rate of 150.05 & PLUSMN; 7.01 mL/min and 151.70 & PLUSMN; 6.72 mL/min with 0.22 & mu;m and 0.45 & mu;m Sterivex filters, respectively. We show that immediate sample filtration increases eDNA recovery in the laboratory, and demonstrate collections in aquaria and marine environments. We anticipate that providing easy to obtain, open hardware designs for eDNA sample collection will increase standardization of aquatic eDNA collection methods and improve cross-study comparisons.",,

However, neural responses may vary due to prior experience, internal states, or stochastic factors, thus generating the need for methods that can assess neural function across many individuals at once. Whereas most recording techniques examine a single animal at a time, we describe the use of wide-field microscopy to scale up neuronal recordings to dozens of Caenorhabditis elegans or other sub-millimeter-scale organisms at once. Open-source hardware and software allow great flexibility in programming fully automated experiments that control the intensity and timing of various stimulus types, including chemical, optical, mechanical, thermal, and electromagnetic stimuli. In particular, microfluidic flow devices provide precise, repeatable, and quantitative control of chemosensory stimuli with sub-second time resolution. The NeuroTracker semi-automated data analysis pipeline then extracts individual and population-wide neural responses to uncover functional changes in neural excitability and dynamics. This paper presents examples of measuring neuronal adaptation, temporal inhibition, and stimulus crosstalk.

CubeSats as a sub-class of nanosatellites have become a game-changer in the industry of scientific research and exploration of the new space technologies. Their cost effectiveness, relative ease of manufacturing, and the predicted lifecycle are the main factors of success. Having such popularity in mind – many vendors, student teams and enthusiast started to build their platforms to offer reuse and faster buildup of such satellites, introducing so-called COTS/MOTS approach of the satellite’s construction. However, looking into statistics – only 2.5% of the launched satellites were able to full perform their mission, and almost 25% just failed. Partially, the key problems are in the area of using non-radiation hardened electronics as the CubeSat idea is to use commercial (or at utmost automotive) components. Authors of the article provide a holistic view on the existing hardware and software platforms that are currently available as COTS/MOTS solutions, as well as their capabilities. Part of the research was done in the area of the available software frameworks, as the modern software has rather high cyclomatic complexity and often it is exactly software components that make CubeSat mission at risk. Software related frameworks are compared via the use of newly introduced by the authors multi-factor ranking model (FMCSA). At the same time the article raises the cross-country problem of the creation and use of the Ukrainian platform for the CubeSats. Authors propose a solution for the creation of the part of the CubeSat platform as the starting point and it is an On-Board Computer (OBC). The idea is to design an OBC that can solve the big portion of the known issues of the CubeSat hardware and software with the major stress on the hardware issues related to the Single-Event Upset (SEU) and Single-Event Latch Up (SEL), without moving to the radiation tolerant semiconductors. Proposed in the article solution combines the selection of the modern central processor, that is industry recognized, availability of the software solutions for it, as well as the power-domains control principle that allows to minimize the potential harm of the SEU and SEL radiation-driven events.",http://rocketspace.dp.ua/index.php/rst/article/download/185/153,

To ensure that a private network satisfies its own requirements and guarantees coverage, it is important to accurately measure the radio performance at the accurate position to further optimize the network. Additionally, as carrier frequencies increase, cellular network-based positioning becomes increasingly important, as it enables more accurate positioning. For example, centimeter-level accuracy is expected in beyond 5G systems owing to the sub-THz band carrier frequency. To accurately compare and assess various cellular network-based positioning methods, positioning devices, which can move along the same trajectory more accurately than at the centimeter-level, are required. To this end, we implemented a three-dimensional (3D) positioning device developed from open-source hardware, which is generally used to implement computer numerical control (CNC) machines and 3D printers. The implemented 3D pointing device is cost-effective and portable and can be freely configurable and resized in one, two, and three dimensions owing to the use of open-source hardware. The received signal strength indicator (RSSI) employing the LoRa module can be obtained using the implemented device. Using a very low carrier frequency system, it is possible to accurately measure the RSSI variations due to multipath propagation. After demonstrating the reproducibility of the data, the effectiveness of the implemented device was confirmed by showing that the RSSI variation and fading correlation coefficient are close to the Rayleigh fading variation.",,

Due to their ease, capability and reliability compared to other conventional injectable medical devices, the market and manufacturing demand for autoinjector devices are increasing rapidly and expected to reach a market of $37.5 billion globally by 2025. Although autoinjectors can offset healthcare treatment costs through self-administered medication, they can be expensive for consumers, which limit their accessibility. This study describes the design and manufacture of a spring-driven and 3-D printed autoinjector to overcome this economic accessibility challenge. The digitally replicable device is released as open-source hardware to enable low-cost distributed manufacturing. The bill of materials and assembly instructions are detailed, and the effectiveness of the autoinjector is tested against the current standard (ISO 11608-1:2022) for needle-based injection systems. The safety and dosing accuracy was tested by measuring the weight of 100% ethyl alcohol expelled from six BD Insulin syringes with varying capacities or needle lengths. A one-way analysis assessed the variability between the dose delivery efficiency of 1mL, 0.5mL, and 0.3mL syringes. Testing indicated that the entire dose was delivered over 97.5% of the time for 1mL and 0.5mL syringes, but the autoinjector's loaded spring force and size exceeded structural limitations of 0.3mL or smaller syringes. Components can be manufactured in about twelve hours using an open-source desktop RepRap-class fused filament 3-D printer. The construction requires two compression springs and 3-D printed parts. The total material cost of CAD$6.83 is less than a tenth of comparable commercial autoinjectors, which makes this approach promising. The autoinjector, however, is a class two medical device and must be approved by regulators. Future work is needed to make distributed manufacturing of such medical devices feasible and reliable to support individuals burdened by healthcare costs.",,

Calibration of the tracker position and orientation is a fundamental task to correct systematic errors. This article explores the effect of metallic distortion on the open hardware Anser EMT system and describes a newly developed approach for volume calibration of the magnetic field model. The technique is also applied to effectively map the field in the presence of magnetic shields that can be used to reduce electromagnetic distortions passively. Unlike calibration techniques commonly found in literature, which aim to correct the tracking position error, our method can reconstruct an analytical magnetic field model starting from a reduced amount of scattered data. This way, a faster convergence of the solver algorithm is obtained, and EMT position and orientation errors are inherently corrected. The new modeling technique was applied to generate a new, undistorted magnetic field model for Anser EMT, to demonstrate the effectiveness of passive shielding, and to compensate for the distortion introduced by a commercial fluoroscopy C-arm. Furthermore, the concept of a real-time distortion compensation technique is expressed based on the modeling method presented in this article. For all the experiments, sub-millimeter errors were obtained after calibration, which may meet the needs of most endoscopic and surgical navigation tasks.",,

Acquiring such a policy on a real robot is a tedious and time-consuming task. This is more challenging in a multi-agent system where individual data may be required from each agent. While training in simulations is the common approach due to efficiency and low-cost, they rarely describe the real world. Consequently, policies trained in simulations and transferred to the real robot usually perform poorly. In this paper, we present a novel real-to-sim-to-real framework to bridge the reality gap for an agent in collective motion of a homogeneous multi-agent system. First, we propose a novel deep neural-network architecture termed Convolutional-Recurrent Network (CR-Net) to capture the complex state transition of an agent and simulate its motion. Once trained with data from one agent, we show that the CR-Net can accurately predict motion of all agents in the group. Second, we propose to invest a limited amount of real data from the agent in a generative model. Then, training the CR-Net with synthetic data sampled from the generative model is shown to be at least equivalent to real data. Hence, the proposed approach provides a sufficiently accurate model with significantly less real data. The generative model can also be disseminated along with open-source hardware for easier usage. We show experiments on ground and underwater vehicles in which multi-agent RL policies are trained in the simulation for collective motion and successfully transferred to the real-world.",,

Running multiple columns simultaneously saves time and improves procedural consistency. Though column chro-matography is widely used, to meet their laboratory needs many investigators must resort to designing and fabricating custom racks for holding their chromatography columns. We have created a robust column rack design, with collection vial holders, that is easily made, inexpensive to build, and may be easily adapted to fit experimental needs. The column holder can be made to hold various sizes of columns (and can be interchanged as neces-sary); the height of columns above collection vials can be precisely set; and the design is modular, so the rack and vial holders can be expanded to accommodate the desired num-bers of columns and the numbers and sizes of vials used to collect fractions eluted from each column. Importantly, the rack is made of inexpensive, readily-available materials and the fabrication is straightforward. Here we present details of the rack's features, a list of materials, and instructions for making it. We hope our design will help investigators who perform gravity-driven column chromatography.

This is especially true if we are to gain insights into one of the least studied aspects: the potential perturbations that neurotoxicants can have on cognitive behaviors. The paucity of experimental data is partly caused by a lack of low-cost technologies for the analysis of higher-level neurological functions (e.g., associative learning) in small aquatic organisms. Here, we present a proof-of-concept prototype that utilizes a new real-time animal tracking software for on-the-fly video analysis and closed-loop, external hardware communications to deliver stimuli based on specific behaviors in aquatic organisms, spanning three animal phyla: chordates (fish, frog), platyhelminthes (flatworm), and arthropods (crustacean). The system's open-source software features an intuitive graphical user interface and advanced adaptive threshold-based image segmentation for precise animal detection. We demonstrate the precision of animal tracking across multiple aquatic species with varying modes of locomotion. The presented technology interfaces easily with low-cost and open-source hardware such as the Arduino microcontroller family for closed-loop stimuli control. The new system has potential future applications in eco-neurotoxicology, where it could enable new opportunities for cognitive research in diverse small aquatic model organisms.",,

Its applications include perception, learning, memory, language, decision making and neural network mapping. Recently, interest has surged in extending EEG measurements to domestic environments. However, the high costs associated with traditional laboratory EEG systems have hindered accessibility for many individuals and researchers in education, research, and medicine. To tackle this, a mobile-EEG device named ""DreamMachine"" was developed. A more affordable alternative to both lab-based EEG systems and existing mobile-EEG devices. This system boasts 24 channels, 24-bit resolution, up to 6 h of battery life, portability, and a low price. Our open-source and open-hardware approach empowers cognitive neuroscience, especially in education, learning, and research, opening doors to more accessibility. This paper introduces the DreamMachine's design and compares it with the lab-based EEG system ""asalabTM"" in an eyes-open and eyes-closed experiment. The Alpha band exhibited higher power in the power spectrum during eyes-closed conditions, whereas the eyes-open condition showed increased power specifically within the Delta frequency range.

They are responsible for water and nutrient uptake and for interacting with biotic and abiotic factors in the soil. The root system architecture (RSA) and its plasticity are crucial for resource acquisition and consequently correlate with plant performance while being highly dependent on the surrounding environment, such as soil properties and therefore environmental conditions. Thus, especially for crop plants and regarding agricultural challenges, it is essential to perform molecular and phenotypic analyses of the root system under conditions as near as possible to nature (# asnearaspossibletonature). To prevent root illumination during experimental procedures, which would heavily affect root development, DarkRoot (D-Root) devices (DRDs) have been developed. In this article, we describe the construction and different applications of a sustainable, affordable, flexible, and easy to assemble open-hardware bench-top LEGO((R)) DRD, the DRD-BIBLOX (Brick Black Box). The DRD-BIBLOX consists of one or more 3D- printed rhizoboxes, which can be filled with soil while still providing root visibility. The rhizoboxes sit in a scaffold of secondhand LEGO((R)) bricks, which allows root development in the dark and non-invasive root tracking with an infrared (IR) camera and an IR light-emitting diode (LED) cluster. Proteomic analyses confirmed significant effects of root illumination on barley root and shoot proteomes. Additionally, we confirmed the significant effect of root illumination on barley root and shoot phenotypes. Our data therefore reinforces the importance of the application of field conditions in the lab and the value of our novel device, the DRD-BIBLOX.

However, there is currently a lack of instrumentation to monitor such experiments in real time, necessitating repeated transfers of the samples to stand-alone analytical instruments, thus limiting the types of experiments that could be performed. Here we address this gap with the development of the optoPlateReader (oPR), an open-source, solid-state, compact device that allows automated optogenetic stimulation and spectroscopy in each well of a 96-well plate. The oPR integrates an optoPlate illumination module with a module called the optoReader, an array of 96 photodiodes and LEDs that allows 96 parallel light measurements. The oPR was optimized for stimulation with blue light and for measurements of optical density and fluorescence. After calibration of all device components, we used the oPR to measure growth and to induce and measure fluorescent protein expression in E. coli. We further demonstrated how the optical read/write capabilities of the oPR permit computer-in-the-loop feedback control, where the current state of the sample can be used to adjust the optical stimulation parameters of the sample according to pre-defined feedback algorithms. The oPR will thus help realize an untapped potential for optogenetic experiments by enabling automated reading, writing, and feedback in microwell plates through open-source hardware that is accessible, customizable, and inexpensive. An open source, 96-well plate reader allows simultaneous optogenetic stimulation and absorbance/fluorescence measurements in each well.",,

In this paper, we introduce a videogame controller designed for use in the functional magnetic resonance imaging as well as magnetoencephalography. The controller is made exclusively of 3D-printed and commercially available parts. We evaluated the quality of our controller by comparing it to a non-MRI compatible controller that was kept outside the scanner. The comparison of response latencies showed reliable button press accuracies of adequate precision. Comparison of the subjects' motion during fMRI recordings of various tasks showed that the use of our controller did not increase the amount of motion produced compared to a regular MR compatible button press box. Motion levels during an ecological videogame task were of moderate amplitude. In addition, we found that the controller only had marginal effect on temporal SNR in fMRI, as well as on covariance between sensors in MEG, as expected due to the use of non-magnetic building materials. Finally, the reproducibility of the controller was demonstrated by having team members who were not involved in the design build a reproduction using only the documentation. This new videogame controller opens new avenues for ecological tasks in fMRI, including challenging videogames and more generally tasks with complex responses.

A gate, such as a door, can have a lock mechanism for securing the area from unauthorized access. Most commercial solutions for access control management offer pre-packaged software systems where customization of the authorization logic is either not allowed or subject to payment. Moreover, cross-platform development is a barrier for solution providers due to the high cost of development and maintenance that it implies. To overcome these limitations and further optimize the entire access control systems development process, we propose a model-driven approach that supports automatic code generation to enable communication between an IoT infrastructure and platforms for Facility Access Management. Specifically, the approach combines the benefits of Near-Field Communication (NFC) and Tinkerforge (i.e., an open-source hardware platform) with model-driven techniques. This allows the approach to exploit both behavioral and structural models for the modeling and the consequent code generation of part of the authorization mechanism, thus providing complete coverage of the code generated for the whole system. We implemented and evaluated our approach in a real-world case study within the premises of a fitness center with an IoT infrastructure consisting of several heterogeneous sensors by showing its practical applicability. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in supporting abstraction and automation concerning traditional code-centric development through code generation features. Consequently, our approach makes the whole development process less time-consuming and error-prone, thus reducing the system's time to market.",,

Despite the research progress, the industry still doubts its applicability, especially for the functional verification of complicated processor chips. Functional verification commonly employs a simulation-based method of co-simulating the design under test with a reference model and checking the consistency of their outcomes given the same input stimuli. We observe limited collaboration and information exchange through the design and verification processes, dramatically leading to inefficiencies when applying the conventional functional verification workflow to agile development. In this paper, we propose workflow integration with collaborative task delegation and dynamic information exchange as the design principles to effectively address the challenges on functional verification under the agile development model. Based on workflow integration, we enhance the functional verification workflows with a series of novel methodologies and toolchains. The diff-rule based agile verification methodology (DRAV) reduces the overhead of building reference models with runtime execution information from designs under test. We present the RISC-V implementation for DRAV, DiffTest, which adopts information probes to extract internal design behaviors for co-simulation and debugging. It further integrates two plugins, namely XFUZZ for effective test generation guided by design coverage metrics and LightSSS for efficient fault analysis triggered by co-simulation mismatches. We present the integrated workflows for agile hardware development and demonstrate their effectiveness in designing and verifying RISC-V processors with 33 functional bugs found in NutShell.

From computing devices, scientific instrumentation, and biological reagents, to remote sensing satellites, researchers rely on hardware to explore and understand the world. However, research equipment is typically based on closed source (i.e. proprietary) hardware, whose designs are legally restricted, preventing others from studying, building, or modifying them. These restrictions cause several problems such as: lack of reproducibility; duplication of effort; forced obsolescence; and higher costs. Crucially, the inefficiencies of closed source hardware reinforce global inequities. This is because the design and manufacturing of research equipment is often monopolised by producers in the Global North. Restricted access to hardware designs mean that only authorised dealers and technicians are allowed to sell or maintain equipment. These services are often unavailable to, or prohibitively expensive for, researchers belonging to historically marginalised communities outside of the Global North. Building on the success of open source software, open source hardware is defined as any physical artefact whose “design is made publicly available with explicit, legally binding freedoms for anyone to study, modify, distribute, make, and sell the design or hardware based on that design”. Open science hardware is an emerging field of practice which studies and applies the principles of open source hardware to research contexts. In 2021, it was formally recognised as a key component in the UNESCO Recommendation on Open Science. Open science hardware provides many benefits compared to its proprietary counterparts. This can include cost savings of up to 87% (Pearce, 2020) and proportional to how often it is replicated; quicker iteration of designs; and adaptation to local needs in underserved communities. Since the 2010s, open science hardware has been developed and used in diverse domains from environmental monitoring, and lab automation, to microscopy. In addition to academics, open science hardware is commonly built by citizen science communities and adapted for different purposes. Other practitioners of open science hardware include educators, social innovators, or artists. In this talk, we provide an overview of open science hardware and the problems it solves. We also provide successful examples of open science hardware projects that serve to not only do good science, but also address global inequities. The talk also presents the Gathering for Open Science Hardware, an international network working towards the adoption of open source hardware across research lifecycle.  ",http://journals.ed.ac.uk/eor/article/download/8112/11875,

For example, researcher-developed sensors, such as audio and video loggers, are being increasingly attached to wildlife tracking collars to provide insights into a range of topics from species interactions to physiology. However, such devices are often prohibitively power-intensive, relative to conventional wildlife collar sensors, and their retrieval without compromising long-term data collection and animal welfare remains a challenge. We present an open-source system (SensorDrop) for remotely detaching individual sensors from wildlife collars. SensorDrop facilitates the retrieval of power-intensive sensors while leaving non-resource-intensive sensors intact on animals. SensorDrop systems can be made using commercially available components and are a fraction of the cost of other timed drop-off devices that detach full wildlife tracking collars. From 2021 to 2022, eight SensorDrop units were successfully deployed on free-ranging African wild dog packs in the Okavango Delta as part of audio-accelerometer sensor bundles attached to wildlife collars. All SensorDrop units detached after 2-3 weeks and facilitated the collection of audio and accelerometer data while leaving wildlife GPS collars intact to continue collecting locational data (>1 year), critical for long-term conservation population monitoring in the region. SensorDrop offers a low-cost method to remotely detach and retrieve individual sensors from wildlife collars. By selectively detaching battery-depleted sensors, SensorDrop maximizes the amount of data collected per wildlife collar deployment and mitigates ethical concerns on animal rehandling. SensorDrop adds to the growing body of open-source animal-borne technologies being utilized by wildlife researchers to innovate and expand upon data collection practices and supports the continued ethical use of novel technologies within wildlife studies.",,

This raises costs and retards innovation. Open-source hardware tools exist for implementing these processes individually; however, they are not easily integrated with other designs. The Broadly Reconfigurable and Expandable Automation Device (BREAD) is a framework that provides many open-source devices which can be connected to create more complex data acquisition and control systems. This article explores the feasibility of using BREAD plug-and-play open hardware to quickly design and test monitoring and control electronics for an industrial materials processing prototype pyrolysis reactor. Generally, pilot-scale pyrolysis plants are expensive custom designed systems. The plug-and-play prototype approach was first tested by connecting it to the pyrolysis reactor and ensuring that it can measure temperature and actuate heaters and a stirring motor. Next, a single circuit board system was created and tested using the designs from the BREAD prototype to reduce the number of microcontrollers required. Both open-source control systems were capable of reliably running the pyrolysis reactor continuously, achieving equivalent performance to a state-of-the-art commercial controller with a ten-fold reduction in the overall cost of control. Open-source, plug-and-play hardware provides a reliable avenue for researchers to quickly develop data acquisition and control electronics for industrial-scale experiments.",,

This new architecture consists of human-computer interaction (HCI) client, a cloud server, and an edge controller. It is designed based on open-source hardware and software, with the advantages of low cost, high flexibility, and easy replication. It can offer a reference design for better and further research of CCSs. Then, a cloud-based maglev control system (CMCS) is developed, and a case study on tracking control with disturbance is performed. Furthermore, a dual-structural controller based on equivalent-input-disturbance (EID) and networked predictive control (NPC) approach is devised to enhance the disturbance rejection performance for CCSs with communication constraints. The system is divided into two subsystems, and the separation theorem is applied to simplify the design. A discrete-time EID (DEID) estimator is introduced for one subsystem to compensate for the time delay and the exogenous disturbance. For another subsystem, a time-event-driven strategy-based NPC method is devised to increase the dynamical performance of handling packet loss. Finally, experimental results verified the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed framework and the DEID-based dual-structural control algorithm.",,

Recently, human and rodent studies using virtual reality (VR) environments have shown VR to be an important tool for uncovering the neural mechanisms underlying spatial learning in the hippocampus and cortex, due to the extremely precise control over parameters such as spatial and contextual cues. Setting up virtual environments for rodent spatial behaviors can, however, be costly and require an extensive background in engineering and computer programming. Here, we present a simple yet powerful system based upon inexpensive, modular, open-source hardware and software that enables researchers to study spatial learning in head-restrained mice using a VR environment. This system uses coupled microcontrollers to measure locomotion and deliver behavioral stimuli while head-restrained mice run on a wheel in concert with a virtual linear track environment rendered by a graphical software package running on a single-board computer.

However, published results usually focus on the experiment, disregarding technical details of the scientific equipment. Lacking enough information about these custom devices prevents their accurate replication, hindering the experiment reproducibility, which is a fundamental requirement for Open Science. In the field of Geology, custom electromechanical devices with low-speed moving elements are required to analyze scaled-down models of the tectonic deformation processes. In these experiments, the earth crust is modeled with materials whose properties and setup are scrupulously specified to comply with the scale model theory and to have standard and reproducible procedures. Notwithstanding this rigorous characterization, we believe that the moving apparatus has received little attention, implicitly assuming an ideal behavior despite the difficulties of moving uniformly at such slow speeds, which could produce disparities with the natural model. In this paper we address this issue by presenting a device for scientific analogue modeling of contractional and extensional tectonics. We analyze the challenges and implications of moving at such low speeds, demonstrate its satisfactory performance and provide suggestions for improvement. In addition, the proposed apparatus is not only affordable and relatively easy to build, but also is an open-hardware project that can be replicated, improved or customized, even in other research fields.

The use of centrally-manufactured commercial tourniquets, however, is not always possible due to supply chain disruptions. The open-source hardware model has been applied to overcome these disruptions in humanitarian crises and several low-cost digitally manufacturable open-source tourniquets have been developed. With the low reliability of improvised tourniquets, it is important to ensure that distributed manufacturing of tourniquets is effective and safe. Tourniquets can be tested, but existing tourniquet testers are expensive, bulky, and complex to operate, which limits their accessibility to an even greater extent than tourniquets in extreme settings. This article fulfills a need by providing a small, transportable, open-source additive-manufactured tourniquet tester that enables inexpensive and accurate testing of tourniquets against known clinical parameters. The <$100 tourniquet tester is validated and tested for operating force of tourniquets in the field or in distributed manufacturing facilities. The tourniquet tester has a significant economic and operational advantage compared to proprietary counterparts available on the market. Once calibrated with a blood pressure monitor, the built-in LCD displays the measuring range of the tester as 0 to 200 N, which is enough to test the validation of all tourniquets.

To determine if a pattern has emerged of companies patenting clearly open-source innovations, this study presents three case studies from the three primary regions of open-source 3-D printing development (EU, U.S., and China) as well as three aspects of 3-D printing technology (AM materials, an open-source 3-D printer, and core open-source 3-D printing concepts used in most 3-D printers). The results of this review have shown that non-inventing entities, called patent parasites, are patenting open-source inventions already well-established in the open-source community and, in the most egregious cases, commercialized by one (or several) firm(s) at the time of the patent filing. Patent parasites are able to patent open-source innovations by using a different language, vague patent titles, and broad claims that encompass enormous swaths of widely diffused open-source innovation space.

These prototypes are developed by individual research groups and are often used for a single publication. Thus, a significant amount of time is devoted to creating proprietary hardware and software hindering the development of a common platform, and shifting away scarce time and efforts from the main research challenges. We address this problem by proposing an open-source actuation module, which can be used to build different types of continuum robots. It consists of a high-torque brushless electric motor, a high resolution optical encoder, and a low-gear-ratio transmission. For this article, we create three different types of continuum robots. In addition, we illustrate, for the first time, that continuum robots built with our actuation module can proprioceptively detect external forces. Consequently, our approach opens untapped and under-investigated research directions related to the dynamics and advanced control of continuum robots, where sensing the generalized flow and effort is mandatory. Besides that, we democratize continuum robots research by providing open-source software and hardware with our initiative called the Open Continuum Robotics Project, to increase the accessibility and reproducibility of advanced methods.",,

The emergence of open scientific hardware has fueled a new movement across biomedical research communities. With the increasing accessibility of consumer-level fabrication technologies, such as three-dimensional printers, open hardware devices can be custom designed, and design files distributed to community members for enhancing rigor, reproducibility, and standardization.

The complexity involved in researching and building soft robots often stems from the interconnectedness of design and control aspects, which are rarely addressed together as a unified problem. To address such complex interdependencies in soft robotics, the Sorotoki toolkit provides a comprehensive and modular programming environment composed of seven Object-Oriented classes. These classes are designed to work together to solve a wide range of soft robotic problems, offering versatility and flexibility for its users. We provide here a comprehensive overview of the Sorotoki software architecture to highlight its usage and applications. The details and interconnections of each module are thoroughly described, collectively explaining how to gradually introduce modeling complexity for various soft robotic scenarios. The effectiveness of Sorotoki is also demonstrated through a range of case studies, including novel problem scenarios and established works widely recognized in the soft robotics community. These case studies cover a broad range of research problems, including: inverse design of soft actuators, passive and active soft locomotion, object manipulation with soft grippers, meta-materials, model reduction, model-based control of soft robots, and online shape estimation.

The regression models developed by re-searchers to predict physicochemical attributes using spectra remain theoretical due to lack of mechanism to integrate the developed models back into proprietary devices. This poses challenge for commercial adaptation of this technology in commercial food quality supply chain. The present study addresses this research gap by presenting first of its kind innovative approach to classify tomatoes based on lycopene content using chemometrics-machine learning framework driven portable short-wave near infra-red (SWNIR) spectropho-tometer developed by integration of open-source hardware (AS7265x multispectral chipset having wavelength range 410-940 nanometre (nm), Arduino Uno microcontroller) and software (R platform), housed in ergo-nomically designed and 3-dimension printed cabinet ensuring noise-free spectra acquisition. The lycopene content was observed to have strong negative correlation with wavelengths (nm) 485, 560 and 585 at rho = - 0.65, - 0.70, - 0.70, whereas strong positive correlation with 760 nm at rho = +0.64. Similar associations were qual-itatively observed using principal component analysis. Atypical of literature, feature selection was performed based on analysis of variance and 14 wavelengths which exhibited statistically significant difference with respect to 15-days storage study (p <= 0.05) were selected for model development. Chemometrics-machine learning framework was used for development of optimised probabilistic and non-probabilistic models including logistic regression, Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), Random Forest (RF), Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) models using 10-fold cross validation subjected to 80-20% train-test split of the dataset.

Accuracy obtained from confusion matrix on test dataset was used as performance metric to compare different models. Logistic regression and RF showcased accuracy of 80%, LDA and SVM at 90% while ANN outperformed all models with accuracy of 95%.

A typical way to measure marine microplastic pollution involves imaging filtered seawater samples stained with a fluorescent dye to aid in the detection of microplastics. Although traditional fluorescence microscopy allows these particles to be manually counted and detected, this is a resource- and labour-intensive task. Here, we describe a novel, low-cost microscope for automated scanning and detection of microplastics in filtered seawater samples-the EnderScope. This microscope is based on the mechanics of a low-cost 3D printer (Creality Ender 3). The hotend of the printer is replaced with an optics module, allowing for the reliable and calibrated motion system of the 3D printer to be used for automated scanning over a large area (>20 x 20 cm). The EnderScope is capable of both reflected light and fluorescence imaging. In both configurations, we aimed to make the design as simple and cost-effective as possible, for example, by using low-cost LEDs for illumination and lighting gels as emission filters. We believe this tool is a cost-effective solution for microplastic measurement. This article is part of the Theo Murphy meeting issue 'Open, reproducible hardware for microscopy'.",,

These devices can be used to explore a wide range of scientific topics, from biology and chemistry to physics and engineering. In this study, we designed and built a multifunction fluorescent open source in vivo/in vitro imaging system (openIVIS) system that integrates a Raspberry Pi with commercial cameras and LEDs with 3D printed structures combined with an acrylic housing. Our openIVIS provides three excitation wavelengths of 460 nm, 520 nm, and 630 nm integrated with Python control software to enable fluorescent measurements across the full visible light spectrum. To demonstrate the potential applications of our system, we tested its performance against a diverse set of experiments including laboratory assays (measuring fluorescent dyes, using optical nanosensors, and DNA gel electrophoresis) to potentially fieldable applications (plant and mineral imaging). We also tested the potential use for a high school biology environment by imaging small animals and tracking their development over the course of ten days. Our system demonstrated its ability to measure a wide dynamic range fluorescent response from millimolar to picomolar concentrations in the same sample while measuring responses across visible wavelengths. These results demonstrate the power and flexibility of open-source hardware and software and how it can be integrated with customizable manufacturing to create low-cost scientific instruments with a wide range of applications.

A lack of affordable and adaptable tools in this area limits research progress and harmonized quality assurance. Purpose: To develop and test a suite of open‐source hardware and software tools for the measurement, characterization, reporting, and correction of geometric distortion in MRI. Methods: An open‐source python library was developed, comprising modules for parametric phantom design, data processing, spherical harmonics, distortion correction, and interactive reporting. The code was used to design and manufacture a distortion phantom consisting of 618 oil filled markers covering a sphere of radius 150 mm. This phantom was imaged on a CT scanner and a novel split‐bore 1.0 T MRI magnet. The CT images provide distortion‐free dataset. These data were used to test all modules of the open‐source software. Results: All markers were successfully extracted from all images. The distorted MRI markers were mapped to undistorted CT data using an iterative search approach. Spherical harmonics reconstructed the fitted gradient data to 1.0 ± 0.6% of the input data. High resolution data were reconstructed via spherical harmonics and used to generate an interactive report. Finally, distortion correction on an independent data set reduced distortion inside the DSV from 5.5 ± 3.1 to 1.6 ± 0.8 mm. Conclusion: Open‐source hardware and software for the measurement, characterization, reporting, and correction of geometric distortion in MRI have been developed. The utility of these tools has been demonstrated via their application on a novel 1.0 T split bore magnet.",https://aapm.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/mp.17342,

Οι συσκευές ανοιχτού κώδικα και υλικού χρησιμοποιούνται σε μεγάλο αριθμό εφαρμογών σε τομείς υγείας, εκπαίδευσης, γεωπονίας, αθλημάτων, βιολογίας, έρευνας και άλλων. Η παρούσα διατριβή εστιάζει στους τομείς της γεωπονίας και έρευνας. Το Κεφάλαιο 1 παρουσιάζει μία σύντομη εισαγωγή για τους παράγοντες που έχουν συνεισφέρει στην διάδοση των συσκευών ανοιχτού κώδικα και υλικού. Επιπλέον παραθέτει ορισμούς για τον ανοιχτό κώδικα και το υλικό όπως και την περιγραφή των εφαρμογών τους στη γεωργία ακριβείας, έξυπνη γεωργία και έρευνα.

Παρουσιάζονται παραδείγματα δημοσιεύσεων που αφορούν τη συγκεκριμένη φιλοσοφία όπως και τα πλεονεκτήματα χρήσης τους ενώ αναγνωρίζεται η ανάγκη ανάπτυξης πλαισίου για την αξιολόγηση των λειτουργιών και της αξιοπιστίας των μετρήσεων των συγκεκριμένων συσκευών. Συγκεκριμένα, ορίζεται η έννοια των ερευνών συμφωνίας και ομοιότητας και η συνεισφορά τους στην αξιολόγηση και στον θετικό ή αρνητικό προσδιορισμό της χρήσης των δύο συσκευών εναλλακτικά χωρίς να επηρεάζει κάποιο αποτέλεσμα. Το Κεφάλαιο 2 περιγράφει τις μεθοδολογίες που χρησιμοποιήθηκαν για την αξιολόγηση της συμφωνίας και ομοιότητας μεταξύ συσκευών ανοιχτού κώδικα και των αντίστοιχων εμπορικών. Συγκεκριμένα, παρέχει μία εκτεταμένη συζήτηση για τη χρήση διαφορετικών μοντέλων ανάλογα με τα δεδομένα που παράγονται από συσκευές υπό διερεύνηση και την αξιολόγηση δεικτών και γραφημάτων που ερμηνεύονται εύκολα ακόμα και από άτομα χωρίς ιδιαίτερη εμπειρία στη στατιστική. Επιπλέον, σε περίπτωση που το συμπέρασμα της έρευνας καταλήγει σε μη αποδεκτή συμφωνία, πιθανές πηγές ασυμφωνίας μπορούν να εντοπιστούν και μέθοδοι διόρθωσης της συμφωνίας μπορούν να εφαρμοστούν. Ακόμα, αναφέρονται τα πλεονεκτήματα και μειονεκτήματα κάθε προσέγγισης για την αξιολόγηση της συμφωνίας και ομοιότητας. Περαιτέρω παρουσιάζεται ο πειραματικός σχεδιασμός και η στατιστική ανάλυση που ακολουθείται ανάλογα με τη φύση της έρευνας καθώς και τα βήματα για τον έγκυρο σχεδιασμό της. Επιπλέον παρουσιάζονται λανθασμένες ή ελλείπεις μέθοδοι αξιολόγηση της συμφωνίας και ομοιότητας μεταξύ δύο συσκευών. Τέλος, αναφέρονται συνοπτικά οι μεθοδολογίες όπως το υλικό και το λογισμικό που χρησιμοποιήθηκε για το σχεδιασμό των συσκευών για την ολοκλήρωση της διατριβής. Στο Κεφάλαιο 3 παρουσιάζεται ο σχεδιασμός και η ανάπτυξη ενός ασύρματου μετεωρολογικού σταθμού ανοιχτού κώδικα και υλικού που μετρά τη θερμοκρασία και υγρασία του περιβάλλοντος. Αρχικά, αξιολογείται η λειτουργία του σταθμού παρακολουθώντας τις μετρήσεις μέσω ασύρματης τεχνολογίας Wi-Fi για επτά μέρες. Έπειτα, σχεδιάζεται πείραμα αξιολόγησης συμφωνίας και ομοιότητας του σταθμού με αντίστοιχο εμπορικό με αισθητήρα Thygro και τα αντίστοιχα περιφερειακά από την εταιρεία Symmetron. Αναφέρεται ο πειραματικός σχεδιασμός καθώς και η χρήση μοντέλων μεικτών επιδράσεων μαζί με τη συνεισφορά τους στη σύγκριση των δύο συσκευών. Για το πείραμα κατασκευάστηκαν τριάντα συσκευές ανοιχτού κώδικα και υλικού και χρησιμοποιήθηκαν τρείς αντίστοιχοι εμπορικοί σταθμοί. Για τον λόγο αυτό δημιουργήθηκαν τρείς ομάδες. Κάθε ομάδα περιέχει 10 σταθμούς ανοιχτού κώδικα και υλικού και μία εμπορική. Κάθε πειραματική μονάδα παράγει ένα σύμπλεγμα μετρήσεων σε συνάρτηση του χρόνου. Το πείραμα τερματίστηκε μετά από επτά μέρες συνεχόμενων μετρήσεων. Καθώς οι μετρήσεις ανά πειραματική μονάδα ήταν πάνω από 220 για κάποιες μέρες (αφού υπήρχαν απώλειες δεδομένων λόγω κακής σύνδεσης στο διαδίκτυο) οι μετρήσεις συγχωνεύτηκαν σε χρονικές ζώνες, με τη μέθοδο που χρησιμοποιεί το Εθνικό Αστεροσκοπείο Αθήνας. Μόνο δύο από τις τρείς μεθοδολογίες συμφωνίας και ομοιότητας υλοποιήθηκαν με επιτυχία και εκτιμήθηκε ένας δείκτης συμφωνίας. Η συμφωνία μεταξύ των συσκευών θεωρήθηκε ανεπαρκής και ως πιθανή πηγή ασυμφωνίας θεωρήθηκε η ακρίβεια των αισθητήρων. Περεταίρω έρευνα μπορεί να υλοποιηθεί για να συμπεριληφθούν όλα τα σημεία των μετρήσεων όπως και επιπλέον παράγοντες που πιθανόν να επηρεάζουν τη συμφωνία, όπως η υγρασία του αέρα ή η τοποθεσία κάθε σταθμού. Τέλος, εναλλακτικές μορφές ασύρματης επικοινωνίας όπως η LoRa μπορούν να προστεθούν στο σταθμό όπως και επιπλέον αισθητήρες. Τα πλεονεκτήματα χρήσης της νέας συσκευής στηρίζονται στο χαμηλό κόστος παραγωγής του όπως και στην εύκολη μορφοποίηση και προσθήκη επιπλέον αισθητήρων. Στο Κεφάλαιο 4 παρουσιάζεται ο σχεδιασμός και η κατασκευή ενός ασύρματου καταγραφέα LoRa ανοιχτού κώδικα και υλικού για τη χρήση σε πειράματα ενυδρειοπονίας σε σάκους υποστρώματος περλίτη. Συγκεκριμένα, η νέα συσκευή είναι συμβατή με αισθητήρες περιεκτικότητας νερού, με πρωτόκολλο επικοινωνίας RS-485. Επιπλέον, ο αισθητήρας που χρησιμοποιήθηκε για το συγκεκριμένο πείραμα μετρά τη θερμοκρασία του σάκου υποστρώματος, την ηλεκτρική αγωγιμότητα καθώς και το pH. Μετά τον έλεγχο καλής λειτουργίας του καταγραφέα, σχεδιάστηκε το πείραμα αξιολόγησης συμφωνίας και ομοιότητας της νέας συσκευής με αντίστοιχη εμπορική. Συγκεκριμένα η εμπορική συσκευή που χρησιμοποιήθηκε για το πείραμα είναι η Handheld Meter (HH150) and SM150 Soil Moisture Sensor. Το μέγεθος δείγματος ήταν 100 σάκοι υποστρώματος περλίτη. Επιπλέον, για την ανάλυση χρησιμοποιήθηκε μοντέλο μέτρησης-σφαλμάτων για την εκτίμηση της διαφοράς στις μετρήσεις σε σχέση με τον καλύτερο γραμμικό αμερόληπτο παράγοντα πρόβλεψης της πραγματικής τιμής της μέτρησης που παράχθηκαν από την εμπορική συσκευή. Τα αποτελέσματα ανέφεραν σημαντική απόκλιση από την εκτίμηση της πραγματικής τιμής των μετρήσεων παραθέτοντας το σταθερό και αναλογικό σφάλμα. Η συμφωνία των δύο οργάνων θεωρήθηκε ικανοποιητική για συγκεκριμένα διαστήματα μετρήσεων. Τα πλεονεκτήματα χρήσης της νέας συσκευής συγκριτικά με της εμπορικής είναι το χαμηλό κόστος παραγωγής και η ευκολία μορφοποίησης της ανάλογα με τις ανάγκες των πειραμάτων. Ο σάκος υποστρώματος περλίτη έχει αρκετή παραλλακτικότητα ως προς την περιεκτικότητα του σε νερό. Επομένως η χρήση πολλαπλών αισθητήρων σε διαφορετικά σημεία του σάκου είναι θεμελιώδης και αποτελεί βασική απαίτηση ως εισροή πληροφορίας σε αλγόριθμους πρόβλεψης περιεκτικότητας νερού στο σάκο. Στο Κεφάλαιο 5 παρουσιάζεται ο σχεδιασμός και η κατασκευή καταγραφέα ανοιχτού κώδικα και υλικού που μετρά pH διαλυμάτων για τη χρήση σε πειράματα Δενδροκομίας. Για τη βαθμονόμηση της συσκευής χρησιμοποιήθηκαν ρυθμιστικά διαλύματα pH τιμών 4,01 και 7,01. Έπειτα αξιολογήθηκε η καλή λειτουργία της συσκευής μετρώντας το pH καρπών εσπεριδοειδών. Στη συσκευή προστέθηκε αδιάβροχος αισθητήρας θερμοκρασίας για την εξισορρόπηση της τιμής pH. Επιπλέον, σχεδιάστηκε μελέτη αξιολόγησης της συμφωνίας και ομοιότητας της νέας συσκευής με αντίστοιχη εμπορική. Συγκεκριμένα, η εμπορική συσκευή που επιλέχθηκε είναι η Hanna HI9024 Waterproof pHMeter. Για την ανάλυση χρησιμοποιήθηκαν μοντέλα μεικτών επιδράσεων και παράχθηκαν δείκτες και χρήσιμα γραφήματα υλοποιώντας παραπάνω από μία μεθοδολογίες. Έπειτα, αναφέρθηκαν τα πλεονεκτήματα και τα μειονεκτήματα κάθε μεθοδολογίας. Τα αποτελέσματα έδειξαν μη αποδεκτή συμφωνία μεταξύ των δύο οργάνων. Η ανάλυση ομοιότητας ανέφερε σταθερή απόκλιση -0.2215 μονάδων pH. Μετά τη χρήση μεθόδων αναβαθμονόμησης η συμφωνία θεωρείται άριστη. Η συσκευή είναι φορητή και μπορεί να χρησιμοποιηθεί για “επι τόπου” μετρήσεις στον αγρό ή στο θερμοκήπιο. Τα πλεονεκτήματα χρήσης της συσκευής είναι το χαμηλό κόστος παραγωγής, περίπου 4 φορές μικρότερο συγκριτικά με τη Hanna HI9024. Περαιτέρω έρευνα μπορεί να υλοποιηθεί για τη χρήση της συσκευής για τη μέτρηση pH εδάφους ή θρεπτικών υποστρωμάτων. Τέλος, επιπλέον αισθητήρες μπορούν να τοποθετηθούν εύκολα στη συσκευή για την ταυτόχρονη άντληση περισσότερων πληροφοριών για τα χαρακτηριστικά του δείγματος. Στο Κεφάλαιο 6 περιγράφεται η κατασκευή συσκευής ανοιχτού κώδικα και υλικού για τις ανάγκες πειραμάτων που αφορούν τη μύγα της Μεσογείου (Ceratitis Capitata). Η συσκευή καταγράφει τη θερμοκρασία στην επιφάνεια και τον πυρήνα καρπών όπως και την εξωτερική θερμοκρασία. Επιπλέον, αξιολογήθηκε η λειτουργία της στο εργαστήριο αλλά και στον αγρό. Για τα πειράματα στον αγρό η συσκευή τοποθετήθηκε σε συγκεκριμένα σημεία σε ποικιλία δέντρων. Το σχήμα αλλά και το μέγεθος της συσκευής καθιστά ιδανική την τοποθέτηση του σε οποιοδήποτε σημείο του δέντρου επιθυμεί ο ερευνητής. Η συσκευή είναι φορητή και λειτουργεί με μπαταρία. Η αυτονομία της μπορεί να φτάσει στις 7 έως 30 μέρες ανάλογα με το χρονικό διάστημα καταγραφής. Έπειτα σχεδιάστηκε μελέτη συμφωνίας και ομοιότητας για τη σύγκριση της θερμοκρασίας του πυρήνα και της επιφάνειας του καρπού καθώς ο στόχος του πειράματος ήταν η ποσοτικοποίηση της απόκλισης των θερμοκρασιών των δύο σημείων σε διαφορετικές συνθήκες. Για την ανάλυση χρησιμοποιήθηκαν μοντέλα μέτρησης-σφαλμάτων. Τα αποτελέσματα αναφέρουν σταθερή απόκλιση 0,331℃ καθώς και αναλογική απόκλιση 0,982.

From a tribological point of view, these are often linked to the reduction of wear and friction. When testing new materials, coating systems or lubricants, the underlying mechanisms and physical relationships are investigated by the deployment of simplified model tests. Advanced commercial test rigs allow high -resolution measurement of important friction and wear parameters, but also entail a considerable cost and thus a certain entry barrier to deal further with tribological aspects. In many research projects, therefore, self -developed test rigs are used, which at the same time, however, makes comparability and reproducibility with other systems considerably more difficult. For this reason, we have developed a pin -on -disc tribometer based on the open hardware approach, which can be completely additively manufactured by fused filament fabrication. In addition to presenting the customizable measurement system, we investigated the measurement capability using 50 repeated measurements on two different tribological test systems. The reproducibility of the measured values was 0.4 % and 1.1 % for friction and 0.6 % and 1.0 % for wear and was thus considerably lower than the standard deviation in the tests on a single tribometer, which was up to 7.7 % and 16.1 % for friction and wear, respectively. So, the presented tribometer can be used, for example, to perform high throughput tests and thus to detect systematic correlations, e.g., in combination with machine learning approaches. Another area of application is training and education of students and professionals.",,

However, the fabrication of DIBs is currently hindered by time-consuming processes and specialized equipment. These fabrication limitations prevent the scale-up of DIB assays, making it difficult to generate the large data sets required to achieve statistically significant conclusions in single-molecule biological assays where heterogeneous behaviour is often observed. This research describes an open-source solution, dubbed “DIB-BOT,” constructed by coupling a nanoinjector with an entry-level 3D printer. We present DIB-BOT as a platform to achieve rapid, reproducible, and reliable fabrication of large numbers of DIBs, addressing the limitations of manual methods. Leveraging commercially available off-the-shelf components, DIB-BOT exhibits high spatial reproducibility, minimal user input, and the ability to scale experiments rapidly. Here we demonstrate the utility of the system by integrating pairwise droplet assembly with a fluorescence plate-reader to execute a biologically relevant assay. When compared with manual DIB fabrication, the DIB-BOT had a tenfold reduction in droplet volume error, a threefold reduction in positional error, and 100% droplet yield. Overall, this method has potential to reduce entry barriers to the use of DIB methods, broadening the applications of DIB research, and generating higher quality data sets.",https://syndication.highwire.org/content/doi/10.1101/2024.01.26.577347,

The PTFE enclosure directly minimizes the overall system expenses, and the implementation of threaded brass inserts allows for facile attachments to the vacuum enclosure without damaging the thermoplastic housing. Front and rear ion funnels maximize ion transmission and help mitigate the effects of radial ion diffusion. A custom planar ion shuttle transports ions from the exit of the rear ion funnel into the ion optics of an ion trap mass analyzer. The planar ion shuttle can couple the IM system to any contemporary Thermo Scientific ion trap mass analyzer. Signal stability and ion intensity remain unchanging following the implementation of the planar ion shuttle when compared to the original stacked ring ion guide. The constructed IM system showed resolving powers up to 85 for various small molecules and proteins using the Fourier transform from a similar to 1 m drift tube. Recorded mobilities derived from first principles agree with published literature results with an average error of 1.1% and an average error toward literature values using single field calibration of <1.3%.",,

However, applying such stimuli simultaneously is difficult in practice. We aimed to design, build, test, and open-source describe a simple device that subjects a conventional mouse cage to independent cycles of physiologically relevant environmental variables. The device is based on a box enclosing the rodent cage to modify the light, feeding, and temperature environments. The device provides temperature-controlled air conditioning (heating or cooling) by a Peltier module and includes programmable feeding and illumination. All functions are set by a user-friendly front panel for independent cycle programming. Bench testing with a model simulating the CO2 production of mice in the cage showed: a) suitable air renewal (by measuring actual ambient CO2), b) controlled realistic illumination at the mouse enclosure (measured by a photometer), c) stable temperature control, and d) correct cycling of light, feeding, and temperature. The cost of all the supplies (retail purchased by e-commerce) was <300 US$. Detailed technical information is open-source provided, allowing for any user to reliably reproduce or modify the device. This approach can considerably facilitate circadian research since using one of the described low-cost devices for any mouse group with a given light-food-temperature paradigm allows for all the experiments to be performed simultaneously, thereby requiring no changes in the light/temperature of a general-use laboratory. 1 Introduction",,

The proposed parametric open-source designs are analyzed through finite element method (FEM) simulations and economic analysis is performed to compare to conventional PV frame at both the module and system levels.

In swarm robotics, groups of robots collaborate using local interactions and collectively solve tasks beyond an individual robot's capabilities. Individual robots must have onboard processing, communication, and sensing capabilities to autonomously react to their neighbors and immediate environment. Most research involving UAVs in swarm robotics presents only simulation results, while key landmark studies with real UAV swarms have used UAV platforms that were custom-built for the respective study. One important reason for this is that no commercial UAV platform comes pre-equipped with the ability to identify and track the positions and poses of nearby drones using only onboard sensors and computation, and in research platforms, the relevant sensing technologies are currently under development. Our aim is to provide a platform that allows swarm robotics researchers to test their algorithms on real UAVs, without having to develop their own custom-built UAVs or to wait until more advanced sensing technology is ready off-the-shelf.

To address this, we introduce OpenCell, an economical, open-source, 3-in-1 laboratory device that combines the functionalities of a bead homogenizer, a microcentrifuge, and a vortex mixer. OpenCell utilizes modular attachments that magnetically connect to a central rotating brushless motor. This motor couples to an epicyclic gearing mechanism, enabling efficient bead homogenization, vortex mixing, and centrifugation within one compact unit. OpenCell's design incorporates multiple redundant safety features, ensuring both the device's and operator's safety. Additional features such as RPM measurement, programmable timers, battery operation, and optional speed control make OpenCell a reliable and reproducible laboratory instrument. In our study, OpenCell successfully isolated DNA from Spinacia oleracea (spinach), with an average yield of 2.3 mu g and an A260/A280 ratio of 1.77, demonstrating its effectiveness for downstream applications such as Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) amplification. With its compact size (20 cm x 28 cm x 6.7 cm) and lightweight design (0.8 kg), comparable to the size and weight of a laptop, OpenCell is portable, making it an attractive component of a 'lab-in-a-backpack' for resource-constrained environments in low-and-middle-income countries and synthetic biology in remote field stations. Leveraging the accessibility of 3D printing and off-the-shelf components, OpenCell can be manufactured and assembled at a low unit cost of less than $50, providing an affordable alternative to expensive laboratory equipment costing over $4000. OpenCell aims to overcome the barriers to entry in synthetic biology research and contribute to the growing collection of frugal and open hardware.",,

Such devices in combination with dedicated frontend electronics, external sensors and modems can offer low cost alternatives for student projects and independently operating small scale instrumentation. The capabilities of sensor-to-sensor communication can be extended to data taking and signal analysis at decent rates. Low-cost approaches to environmental monitoring will be critical for developing the evidence base needed to better understand the climate system, specifically in our case for understanding the water cycle. Off-the-shelf-components-based, internet-connected devices are easy to monitor and maintain, low risk and capable of extensive deployment to address the challenge of geographical variability and can address user- and site-specific demands. We present our project of a data logger platform ""nCollector"" based on an Arduino DUE, including data storage on SD cards, serial data transmission via USB, RS485, SDI-12, telemetry via GSM (4G), Nb-IoT and LoRa including its power supply and a minimal user interface. For outdoor instrumentation we specifically designed a solution with a low power demand of 0.2 W in order to realize 24/7 operation under harsh conditions with medium sized PV panels and batteries. With our presentation we want to provide a model case for other researchers to take inspiration from, share our experience with building and deploying over 100 systems all over Europe and help engaging the community to enhance their own instrumentation and data taking.&#160;",,

Unfortunately, these algorithms are proprietary, and academia has no means of directly contributing to these results. In fact, nothing at the same stage of development exists in academia. Despite the extensive research in ECG signal processing, from signal conditioning to expert systems, a cohesive single application for clinical use is not ready yet. This is due to a serious lack of coordination in the academic efforts, which involve not only algorithms for signal processing, but also the signal acquisition equipment itself. For instance, the different sampling rates and the different noise levels frequently found in the available signal databases can cause severe incompatibility problems when the integration of different algorithms is desired. Therefore, this work aims to solve this incompatibility problem by providing the academic community with a diagnostic-grade electrocardiograph. The intention is to create a new standardized ECG signals database in order to address the automatic interpretation problem and create an electrocardiography system that can fully assist clinical practitioners, as the proprietary systems do. Achieving this objective is expected through an open and coordinated collaboration platform for which a webpage has already been created.",,

Among the various techniques available, photoplethysmography stands out as particularly promising for assessing vital signs such as heart rate, respiratory rate, oxygen saturation, and blood pressure. Despite the efficacy of this method, many commercially available wearables, bearing Conformité Européenne marks and the approval of the Food and Drug Administration, are often integrated within proprietary, closed data ecosystems and are very expensive. In an effort to democratize access to affordable wearable devices, our research endeavored to develop an open-source photoplethysmographic sensor utilizing off-the-shelf hardware and open-source software components. The primary aim of this investigation was to ascertain whether the combination of off-the-shelf hardware components and open-source software yielded vital-sign measurements (specifically heart rate and respiratory rate) comparable to those obtained from more expensive, commercially endorsed medical devices. Conducted as a prospective, single-center study, the research involved the assessment of fifteen participants for three minutes in four distinct positions, supine, seated, standing, and walking in place. The sensor consisted of four PulseSensors measuring photoplethysmographic signals with green light in reflection mode. Subsequent signal processing utilized various open-source Python packages. The heart rate assessment involved the comparison of three distinct methodologies, while the respiratory rate analysis entailed the evaluation of fifteen different algorithmic combinations. For one-minute average heart rates’ determination, the Neurokit process pipeline achieved the best results in a seated position with a Spearman’s coefficient of 0.9 and a mean difference of 0.59 BPM. For the respiratory rate, the combined utilization of Neurokit and Charlton algorithms yielded the most favorable outcomes with a Spearman’s coefficient of 0.82 and a mean difference of 1.90 BrPM. This research found that off-the-shelf components are able to produce comparable results for heart and respiratory rates to those of commercial and approved medical wearables.",https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/24/12/3766/pdf,

Seaweed presents a promising option but requires investigation into the viability of unconventionally sourced ropes for harvesting. In this regard, a low-cost reliable method to test the tensile strength of rope is needed to validate alternative materials for use in harvesting seaweed. Commercial rope testing jigs alone range in price from several thousand to tens of thousands of dollars, so there is interest in developing a lower-cost alternative. Addressing these needs, this article reports on an open-source design for tensile strength rope testing hardware. The hardware design focuses on using readily available parts that can be both sourced from a hardware store and manufactured with simple tools to provide the greatest geographic accessibility. The jig design, which can be fabricated for CAD 20, is two to three orders of magnitude less expensive than commercially available solutions. The jig was built and tested using a case study example investigating denim materials (of 1 5/8”, 3 1/4”, 4 7/8”, 6 1/2”, and 8 1/8” widths) as a potential alternative rope material for seaweed farming. Denim demonstrated strengths of up to 1.65 kN for the widest sample, and the jig demonstrated sufficient strength and stiffness for operations at forces below 4 kN. The results are discussed and areas for future improvements are outlined to adapt the device to other circumstances and increase the strength of materials that can be tested.",https://www.mdpi.com/2813-6640/2/1/2/pdf,
