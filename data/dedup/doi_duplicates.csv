The basic idea is to leverage the existing lighting infrastructure and apply trilateration to localize any devices with light sensing capability (e.g., a smartphone), using LED lamps as anchors. Through the design of Epsilon, we identify and tackle several technique challenges. In particular, we establish and experimentally verify the optical channel model for localization. We adopt BFSK and channel hopping to enable reliable location beaconing from multiple, uncoordinated light sources over the shared optical medium. We handle realistic situations towards robust localization, for example, we exploit user involvement to resolve the ambiguity in case of insufficient LED anchors. We have implemented the Epsilon system and evaluated it with a small scale hardware testbed as well as moderate-size simulations. Experimental results confirmed the effectiveness of Epsilon: the 90th percentile accuracies are 0.4m, 0.7m and 0.8m for three typical office environments. Even in the extreme situation with a single light, the 90th percentile accuracy is 1.1m. We believe that visible light based localization is promising to significantly improve the positioning accuracy, despite few open problems in practice.",,,epsilon: a visible light based positioning system,

We introduce two new Fast Fourier Transform convolution implementations: one based on NVIDIA's cuFFT library, and another based on a Facebook authored FFT implementation, fbfft, that provides significant speedups over cuFFT (over 1.5x) for whole CNNs. Both of these convolution implementations are available in open source, and are faster than NVIDIA's cuDNN implementation for many common convolutional layers (up to 23.5x for some synthetic kernel configurations). We discuss different performance regimes of convolutions, comparing areas where straightforward time domain convolutions outperform Fourier frequency domain convolutions. Details on algorithmic applications of NVIDIA GPU hardware specifics in the implementation of fbfft are also provided.",,,fast convolutional nets with fbfft: a gpu performance evaluation,

Much of the previous work in this area has demonstrated the potential for significant energy and performance improvements, but these works largely consist of ad hoc techniques that are applied to a small number of similar applications. Mainstream adoption of approximate computing requires a deeper understanding of the inherent application resilience and the codesign hardware to go with the software. This dictates tools and methods that can help programmers reason about the scope and behavior of approximations in applications. To this end, this paper discusses an open source toolkit, called iACT (Intel’s Approximate Computing Toolkit) to analyze and study the scope of approximations in applications. Our toolkit consists of a compiler, runtime and a simulated hardware test bed. We discuss the design of this toolkit and present examples of how to use this toolkit in this paper. As an example on how to use this toolkit, we include two different applications and analyze the scope of approximate computing in these.",,,iact: a software-hardware framework for understanding the scope of approximate computing,

These interactions are challenging to replicate due to dynamic inputs in real-world environments that cause various interactions of hardware components and control software within the network. In particular, automotive networks are challenging for security research and training because although the protocols of the automotive networks are standardized (e.g., CAN, LIN), the implementation details by each automotive manufacturer are not standardized and are generally not publicly available. In this paper, we present OCTANE, which reduces the barrier of entry into the security research and training of automotive networks by providing a software package and a hardware framework for the reverse engineering and testing of automotive networks. OCTANE provides a platform for security research and training by replicating the interactions between the hardware components and control software of the systems so that the user can focus on the security aspects of the automotive network instead of the tool configuration and setup. In addition, OCTANE includes security focused features, such as the ability to replay and fuzz test different automotive network protocols.

Therefore, existing saliency prediction datasets are order-of-magnitudes smaller than typical datasets for other vision recognition tasks. The small size of these datasets limits the potential for training data intensive algorithms, and causes overfitting in benchmark evaluation. To address this deficiency, this paper introduces a webcam-based gaze tracking system that supports large-scale, crowdsourced eye tracking deployed on Amazon Mechanical Turk (AMTurk). By a combination of careful algorithm and gaming protocol design, our system obtains eye tracking data for saliency prediction comparable to data gathered in a traditional lab setting, with relatively lower cost and less effort on the part of the researchers. Using this tool, we build a saliency dataset for a large number of natural images. We will open-source our tool and provide a web server where researchers can upload their images to get eye tracking results from AMTurk.",,,turkergaze: crowdsourcing saliency with webcam based eye tracking,

Plant Computer Vision (PlantCV) was developed as open-source, hardware platform-independent software for quantitative image analysis. In a 4-week experiment, wild Setaria viridis and domesticated Setaria italica had fundamentally different temporal responses to water availability. While both lines produced similar levels of biomass under limited water conditions, Setaria viridis maintained the same water-use efficiency under water replete conditions, while Setaria italica shifted to less efficient growth. Overall, the Bellwether Phenotyping Platform and PlantCV software detected significant effects of genotype and environment on height, biomass, water-use efficiency, color, plant architecture, and tissue water status traits.

However, printed parts are typically plastic and often perform poorly compared to traditionally machined mechanisms. We have overcome many of the limitations of 3D printed mechanisms by exploiting the compliance of the plastic to produce a monolithic 3D printed flexure translation stage, capable of sub-micron-scale motion over a range of 8 × 8 × 4 mm. This requires minimal post-print clean-up and can be automated with readily available stepper motors. The resulting plastic composite structure is very stiff and exhibits remarkably low drift, moving less than 20 μm over the course of a week, without temperature stabilisation. This enables us to construct a miniature microscope with excellent mechanical stability, perfect for time-lapse measurements in situ in an incubator or fume hood. The ease of manufacture lends itself to use in containment facilities where disposability is advantageous and to experiments requiring many microscopes in parallel. High performance mechanisms based on printed flexures need not be limited to microscopy, and we anticipate their use in other devices both within the laboratory and beyond.",,,a one-piece 3d printed flexure translation stage for open-source microscopy.,10.1063/1.4941068

They will also form the starting point for further progress beyond the current generation of mobile cellular networks to chalk a path towards fifth generation mobile networks. Several new approaches and technologies are being considered as potential elements making up such a future mobile network, including cloudification of radio network, radio network programability and APIs following SDN principles, native support of machinetype communication, and massive MIMO. Research on these technologies requires realistic and flexible experimentation platforms that offer a wide range of experimentation modes from real-world experimentation to controlled and scalable evaluations while at the same time retaining backward compatibility with current generation systems. In this work, we present OpenAirInterface (OAI) as a suitably flexible platform towards open LTE ecosystem and playground. We will demonstrate an example of the use of OAI to deploy a low-cost open LTE network using commodity hardware with standard LTE-compatible devices. We will further show the feasibility of using OpenAirInterface to implement some features of 5G, such as cloud-RAN centralized processing, massive MIMO, and alternative waveforms for low-latency communications.",,,openairinterface: open-source software radio solutions for 5g,

X4-MaG is a small, low-cost open quadrotor of only 307-grammes which offers two levels of controllers providing a manual mode and an automatic mode thanks to powerful Linux-based controller embedded onboard. The experiments presented here show the reliability of the open hardware and software embedded onboard the quadrotor. To estimate the robot s attitude, a quaternion-based complementary filter requiring very few computational resources was developed and implemented on an 8-bit Arduino board. It was also established that the stabilization feedback system based on quaternions tracks the attitude setpoints with precision up to twice greater than a classical cascaded PI controller. The controllers and estimators were designed in the Matlab/Simulink environment and directly implemented onboard the tiny Linux-based autopilot board using a custom made toolbox (RT-MaG toolbox). The autopilot was tested in the brand-new Marseilles Flying Arena with various 3-D flight trajectories and found to be highly accurate with errors of only 0.7cm in hover and less than 3.2cm at 1.2m.s(-1). The X4-MaG quadrotor was able to reach speeds greater than 2m.s(-1) and reject attitude disturbances of 20' within 0.8s.",,,x4-mag: a low-cost open-source micro-quadrotor and its linux-based controller,10.1260/1756-8293.7.2.89

Although forking in open source software does not require the permission of the original authors, the new version, nevertheless, competes for the attention of the same developers that have worked on the original version. The motivations developers have for performing forks are many, but in general they have received little attention. In this paper, we present the results of a study of forks performed in SourceForge (http://sourceforge.net/) and list the developers’ motivations for their actions. The main motivation, seen in close to half of the cases of forking, was content modification; either adding content to the original program or focusing the content to the needs of a specific segment of users. In a quarter of the cases the motivation was technical modification; either porting the program to new hardware or software, or improving the original.",,,"understanding code forking in open source software: an examination of code forking, its effect on open source software, and how it is viewed and practiced by developers",

The system consists of a reliable platform with a dual-core processor (implemented using a FPGA) architecture designed as open-hardware, running two isolated real-time operating systems which are connected through a safe core-to-core communication channel that executes the safety-critical applications. Moreover, the safety-critical system is connected to an external processor, an ARM9, which is used as an external sensing system. The ARM9 runs the non-safety-critical applications and allows the system to insert modifications updating without affecting the safety capabilities of the safetycritical part. This platform is described providing evidences of the isolation between safety-critical (SC) and non-safety-critical (NSC) applications, as well as describing an updating methodology for non-safety-critical applications. This system is validated using a complete and reliable application for safe emergency stop applications for industrial machinery.",,,safe motor controller in a mixed-critical environment with runtime updating capabilities,

In this work, we propose a Structured Sparsity Learning (SSL) method to regularize the structures (i.e., filters, channels, filter shapes, and layer depth) of DNNs. SSL can: (1) learn a compact structure from a bigger DNN to reduce computation cost; (2) obtain a hardware-friendly structured sparsity of DNN to efficiently accelerate the DNNs evaluation. Experimental results show that SSL achieves on average 5.1x and 3.1x speedups of convolutional layer computation of AlexNet against CPU and GPU, respectively, with off-the-shelf libraries. These speedups are about twice speedups of non-structured sparsity; (3) regularize the DNN structure to improve classification accuracy. The results show that for CIFAR-10, regularization on layer depth can reduce 20 layers of a Deep Residual Network (ResNet) to 18 layers while improve the accuracy from 91.25% to 92.60%, which is still slightly higher than that of original ResNet with 32 layers. For AlexNet, structure regularization by SSL also reduces the error by around ~1%. Open source code is in this https URL",,,learning structured sparsity in deep neural networks,

Open-source software packages for Machine Learning and inexpensive commodity hardware have reduced the barrier of entry for exploring novel approaches at scale. It is possible to train models over millions of examples within a few days. Although large-scale datasets exist for image understanding, such as ImageNet, there are no comparable size video classification datasets.  In this paper, we introduce YouTube-8M, the largest multi-label video classification dataset, composed of ~8 million videos (500K hours of video), annotated with a vocabulary of 4800 visual entities. To get the videos and their labels, we used a YouTube video annotation system, which labels videos with their main topics. While the labels are machine-generated, they have high-precision and are derived from a variety of human-based signals including metadata and query click signals. We filtered the video labels (Knowledge Graph entities) using both automated and manual curation strategies, including asking human raters if the labels are visually recognizable. Then, we decoded each video at one-frame-per-second, and used a Deep CNN pre-trained on ImageNet to extract the hidden representation immediately prior to the classification layer. Finally, we compressed the frame features and make both the features and video-level labels available for download.  We trained various (modest) classification models on the dataset, evaluated them using popular evaluation metrics, and report them as baselines. Despite the size of the dataset, some of our models train to convergence in less than a day on a single machine using TensorFlow. We plan to release code for training a TensorFlow model and for computing metrics.",,,youtube-8m: a large-scale video classification benchmark,

Gene rally, each quadcopter implementation required different sensors which are needed to attach and integrate into quadcopter system. However, the most critical part in almost cases is preparing the quad copter flight performance and capability to be suit ed in any outdoor applications. Because of that reason , this paper has proposed an implementation of Open-Source Project (OSPs) platform as autonomous Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) quadcopter development that can be fitted for any outdoor applications or even in research experimental purposes. We started out with an explanation about the genera l approach that has been used in the development of a quadcopter testbed, and then followed with detail explanations in the OSP platform approach. The OSP platform is the most popular approach. The main reason is because of their flexibility in both hardware and software. The basic quadcopter configuration for autonomous flight also presented and applied. This paper also provided several outdoor experiments results in uncontrolled environment that have been executed using our developed testbed to evaluate their performance, such as attitude and altitude stabilization, interference and vibration effect, and trajectory mapping generation. Finally, throughout this project, we realized that the OPSs quadcopter platform has offered almost complete frameworks in the development of quadcopter for any outdoor applications or even as a research testbed system.",,,open-source project (osps) platform for outdoor quadcopter,

Digital manufacturing technologies have only recently become widespread and the return on investment (ROI) was not clear, so funding for open hardware development was historically sparse. This paper clarifies a method for determining an ROI for FOSH scientific hardware development. By using open source hardware design that can be manufactured digitally the relatively minor development costs result in enormous ROIs for the scientific community. A case study is presented of an syringe pump released under open-licenses, which results in ROIs for funders ranging from 100s to 1,000s of percent after only a few months. It is clear that policies encouraging free and open source scientific hardware development should be made by organizations interested in maximizing return on public investments for science.",,,return on investment for open source hardware development,

In cloud computing and other systems, many users and applications could benefit from SGX. Unfortunately, current applications will not work out-of-the-box on SGX. Although previous work has shown that a library OS can execute unmodified applications on SGX, a belief has developed that a library OS will be ruinous for performance and TCB size, making application code modification an implicit prerequisite to adopting SGX.    This paper demonstrates that these concerns are exaggerated, and that a fully-featured library OS can rapidly deploy unmodified applications on SGX with overheads comparable to applications modified to use ""shim"" layers. We present a port of Graphene to SGX, as well as a number of improvements to make the security benefits of SGX more usable, such as integrity support for dynamically-loaded libraries, and secure multiprocess support. Graphene-SGX supports a wide range of unmodified applications, including Apache, GCC, and the R interpreter. The performance overheads of Graphene-SGX range from matching a Linux process to less than 2× in most single-process cases; these overheads are largely attributable to current SGX hardware or missed opportunities to optimize Graphene internals, and are not necessarily fundamental to leaving the application unmodified. Graphene-SGX is open-source and has been used concurrently by other groups for SGX research.",,,graphene-sgx: a practical library os for unmodified applications on sgx,

The design exploration was performed through synthesis, place and route using the foundry-provided standard-cell library and the memory compiler in the TSMC 28 nm HPM process (high performance mobile). BOOM is an open-source processor that implements the RV64G RISC-V Instruction Set Architecture (ISA). Like most contemporary high-performance cores, BOOM is superscalar (able to execute multiple instructions per cycle) and out-oforder (able to execute instructions as their dependencies are resolved and not restricted to their program order). BOOM is implemented as a parameterizable generator written using the Chisel hardware construction language [2] that can used to generate synthesizable implementations targeting both FPGAs and ASICs. BOOMv2 is an update in which the design effort has been informed by analysis of synthesized, placed and routed data provided by a contemporary industrial tool flow. We also had access to standard singleand dual-ported memory compilers provided by the foundry, allowing us to explore design trade-offs using different SRAM memories and comparing against synthesized flip-flop arrays. The main distinguishing features of BOOMv2 include an updated 3-stage front-end design with a bigger set-associative Branch Target Buffer (BTB); a pipelined register rename stage; split floating point and integer register files; a dedicated floating point pipeline; separate issue windows for floating point, integer, and memory micro-operations; and separate stages for issue-select and register read. Managing the complexity of the register file was the largest obstacle to improving BOOM’s clock frequency. We spent considerable effort on placing-and-routing a semi-custom 9port register file to explore the potential improvements over a fully synthesized design, in conjunction with microarchitectural techniques to reduce the size and port count of the register file. BOOMv2 has a 37 fanout-of-four (FO4) inverter delay after synthesis and 50 FO4 after place-and-route, a 24% reduction from BOOMv1’s 65 FO4 after place-and-route. Unfortunately, instruction per cycle (IPC) performance drops up to 20%, mostly due to the extra latency between load instructions and dependent instructions. However, the new BOOMv2 physical design paves the way for IPC recovery later. BOOMv1-2f3i int/idiv/fdiv",,,boom v 2 an open-source out-of-order risc-v core,

Yet their use has been limited primarily to applications developed by the device vendors. Recent standardization of TEE interfaces by GlobalPlatform (GP) promises to partially address this problem by enabling GP-compliant trusted applications to run on TEEs from different vendors. Nevertheless ordinary developers wishing to develop trusted applications face significant challenges. Access to hardware TEE interfaces are difficult to obtain without support from vendors. Tools and software needed to develop and debug trusted applications may be expensive or non-existent. Open-TEE conforms to GP specifications. It allows developers to develop and debug trusted applications with the same tools they use for developing software in general. Once a trusted application is fully debugged, it can be compiled for any actual hardware TEE. Through performance measurements and a user study we demonstrate that Open-TEE is efficient and easy to use. We have made OpenTEE freely available as open source",,,trusted execution environment,

Fluorescence measurement is typically achieved by utilizing a blue or red monochromatic excitation light source. However, algal photosynthetic pigments can differ in their absorption spectra, potentially leading to excitation wavelength dependent measurements of maximal and light acclimated PSII photosynthetic quantum yield (Fv/Fm or Fq'/Fm') and functional absorption cross section (sigma(PSII) or sigma(PSII)). Here we utilized an open source hardware development platform to construct a multispectral excitation fluorometer to assess spectrally dependent differences in photochemistry within four different Symbiodinium species (two of each ITS2-type A4 and B1). Multivariate analysis of light acclimated photochemical signatures showed separation between most alga types. These spectrally dependent differences in light acclimated PSII efficiency and PSII functional absorption cross section likely reflect changes in light harvesting compounds, their connectivity to the PSII reaction centers and the balance between photochemical and non-photochemical fluorescence quenching. Additionally, acclimation to low (20 iLmol photons M-2 s(-1)) and high (200 mu mol photons m(-2) s(-1)) light conditions was examined in two of these symbionts types (ITS-2 type A4 and B1) As expected, chlorophyll a cell(-1) decreased under high light acclimation in both symbionts. However, only A4 saw a subsequent reduction in absorbance whereas cellular volume decreased in the B1 (S. minutum) symbiont. In response to high light acclimation, Fv/Fm was significantly lower at all excitation wavelengths for the B1 symbiont where as efficiencies remained the same for A4. However, high-light acclimated Fq'/Fm' levels decreased in both symbionts, but only when measured using the 615 or 625 nm excitation wavelengths. Non-photochemical quenching within the antennae bed was downregulated under high light acclimation in the A4 symbiont, but only when measured using the 505 and 530 nm excitation wavelengths. Such changes in Fq'/Fm' and antennae bed quenching highlight the benefits of spectrally resolved photochemical measurements. Additionally, the utilization of Arduino and Bitscope hardware exemplifies the potential of open source development platforms for construction of highly customizable instrumentation for photosynthetic research.",,,use of open source hardware and software platforms to quantify spectrally dependent differences in photochemical efficiency and functional absorption cross section within the dinoflagellate <i>symbiodinium</i> spp.,10.3389/fmars.2017.00365

Achieving high performance on each new topology remains challenging, as each requires some level of manual effort. This issue is compounded by the proliferation of frameworks and hardware platforms. The current approach, which we call""direct optimization"", requires deep changes within each framework to improve the training performance for each hardware backend (CPUs, GPUs, FPGAs, ASICs) and requires $\mathcal{O}(fp)$ effort; where $f$ is the number of frameworks and $p$ is the number of platforms. While optimized kernels for deep-learning primitives are provided via libraries like Intel Math Kernel Library for Deep Neural Networks (MKL-DNN), there are several compiler-inspired ways in which performance can be further optimized. Building on our experience creating neon (a fast deep learning library on GPUs), we developed Intel nGraph, a soon to be open-sourced C++ library to simplify the realization of optimized deep learning performance across frameworks and hardware platforms. Initially-supported frameworks include TensorFlow, MXNet, and Intel neon framework. Initial backends are Intel Architecture CPUs (CPU), the Intel(R) Nervana Neural Network Processor(R) (NNP), and NVIDIA GPUs. Currently supported compiler optimizations include efficient memory management and data layout abstraction. In this paper, we describe our overall architecture and its core components. In the future, we envision extending nGraph API support to a wider range of frameworks, hardware (including FPGAs and ASICs), and compiler optimizations (training versus inference optimizations, multi-node and multi-device scaling via efficient sub-graph partitioning, and HW-specific compounding of operations).",,,"intel ngraph: an intermediate representation, compiler, and executor for deep learning",

Uniform quantization using integer multiply-add has been thoroughly investigated, which requires learning many quantization parameters, fine-tuning training or other prerequisites. Little effort is made to improve floating point relative to this baseline; it remains energy inefficient, and word size reduction yields drastic loss in needed dynamic range. We improve floating point to be more energy efficient than equivalent bit width integer hardware on a 28 nm ASIC process while retaining accuracy in 8 bits with a novel hybrid log multiply/linear add, Kulisch accumulation and tapered encodings from Gustafson's posit format. With no network retraining, and drop-in replacement of all math and float32 parameters via round-to-nearest-even only, this open-sourced 8-bit log float is within 0.9% top-1 and 0.2% top-5 accuracy of the original float32 ResNet-50 CNN model on ImageNet. Unlike int8 quantization, it is still a general purpose floating point arithmetic, interpretable out-of-the-box. Our 8/38-bit log float multiply-add is synthesized and power profiled at 28 nm at 0.96x the power and 1.12x the area of 8/32-bit integer multiply-add. In 16 bits, our log float multiply-add is 0.59x the power and 0.68x the area of IEEE 754 float16 fused multiply-add, maintaining the same signficand precision and dynamic range, proving useful for training ASICs as well.",,,rethinking floating point for deep learning,

Current techniques for security testing of embedded software rely either on source code or on binaries. Detecting vulnerabilities by testing binary code is harder, because source code semantics are lost. Unfortunately, in embedded systems, high-level source code (C/C++) is often mixed with hand-written assembly, which cannot be directly handled by current source-based tools.    In this paper we introduce Inception, a framework to perform security testing of complete real-world embedded firmware. Inception introduces novel techniques for symbolic execution in embedded systems. In particular, Inception Translator generates and merges LLVM bitcode from high-level source code, hand-written assembly, binary libraries, and part of the processor hardware behavior. This design reduces differences with real execution as well as the manual effort. The source code semantics are preserved, improving the effectiveness of security checks. Inception Symbolic Virtual Machine, based on KLEE, performs symbolic execution, using several strategies to handle different levels of memory abstractions, interaction with peripherals, and interrupts. Finally, the Inception Debugger is a high-performance JTAG debugger which performs redirection of memory accesses to the real hardware.    We first validate our implementation using 53000 tests comparing Inception's execution to concrete execution on an Arm Cortex-M3 chip. We then show Inception's advantages on a benchmark made of 1624 synthetic vulnerable programs, four real-world open source and industrial applications, and 19 demos. We discovered eight crashes and two previously unknown vulnerabilities, demonstrating the effectiveness of Inception as a tool to assist embedded device firmware testing.",,,inception: system-wide security testing of real-world embedded systems software,

Advances in open hardware platforms and offtheshelf photoplethysmogram (PPG) sensors allow the nonintrusive collection of heart rate data at very low cost. However, the signal is not trivial to analyse, since the morphology of PPG waveforms differs from electrocardiogram (ECG) waveforms and shows different noise patterns. PPG is often preferable because it can be collected less intrusively. However, few validated open source available algorithms exist that handle PPG data well, as most of these algorithms are specifically designed for ECG data. We have developed a novel algorithm specifically for PPG data collected in noisy fieldor simulatorbased settings. The main aim of this paper is to present the validation of a novel algorithm on a PPG dataset collected in a recent driving simulator experiment. The dataset was manually annotated, and performance of the algorithm compared to two other popular open source available algorithms. We show that the algorithm performs well and displays superior performance on the PPG dataset.

The two-level ISA is based on (1) a task-ISA that explicitly orchestrates concurrent compute and memory tasks and (2) a microcode-ISA which implements a wide variety of operators with single-cycle tensor-tensor operations. Next, we propose a runtime system equipped with a JIT compiler for flexible code-generation and heterogeneous execution that enables effective use of the VTA architecture.

This manual translation step is time-consuming and requires expertise that limit the applicability of FPGAs in this important domain. In this paper, we present an open-source tool-flow that maps numerical computation models written in Tensorflow to synthesizable hardware. Unlike other tools, which are often constrained by a small number of inflexible templates, our flow uses Google's XLA compiler which emits LLVM code directly from a Tensorflow specification.

While semantic segmentation algorithms enable 3D image analysis and quantification in many applications, the design of respective specialised solutions is non-trivial and highly dependent on dataset properties and hardware conditions. We propose nnU-Net, a deep learning framework that condenses the current domain knowledge and autonomously takes the key decisions required to transfer a basic architecture to different datasets and segmentation tasks. Without manual tuning, nnU-Net surpasses most specialised deep learning pipelines in 19 public international competitions and sets a new state of the art in the majority of the 49 tasks. The results demonstrate a vast hidden potential in the systematic adaptation of deep learning methods to different datasets. We make nnU-Net publicly available as an open-source tool that can effectively be used out-of-the-box, rendering state of the art segmentation accessible to non-experts and catalyzing scientific progress as a framework for automated method design.",,,automated design of deep learning methods for biomedical image segmentation,

Our method scales to complex, realistic architectures and is hardware-aware through the use of accelerator-specific, profile-based cost models.

Typical ML models are built by specialists and require specialized hardware/software as well as ML experience to validate. This makes it challenging for non-technical collaborators and endpoint users (e.g. physicians) to easily provide feedback on model development and to gain trust in ML. The accessibility challenge also makes collaboration more difficult and limits the ML researcher's exposure to realistic data and scenarios that occur in the wild. To improve accessibility and facilitate collaboration, we developed an open-source Python package, Gradio, which allows researchers to rapidly generate a visual interface for their ML models. Gradio makes accessing any ML model as easy as sharing a URL. Our development of Gradio is informed by interviews with a number of machine learning researchers who participate in interdisciplinary collaborations. Their feedback identified that Gradio should support a variety of interfaces and frameworks, allow for easy sharing of the interface, allow for input manipulation and interactive inference by the domain expert, as well as allow embedding the interface in iPython notebooks. We developed these features and carried out a case study to understand Gradio's usefulness and usability in the setting of a machine learning collaboration between a researcher and a cardiologist.",,,gradio: hassle-free sharing and testing of ml models in the wild,

Recently, device manufacturers are adding neural processing units into high-end phones for on-device inference, but these account for only a small fraction of hand-held devices.

CCF provides a simple programming model of a highly-available data store and a universally-verifiable log that implements a ledger abstraction. CCF leverages trust in a consortium of governing members and in a network of replicated hardware-protected execution environments to achieve high throughput, low latency, strong integrity and strong confidentiality for application data and code executing on the ledger. CCF embeds consensus protocols with Byzantine and crash faulttolerant configurations. All configurations support strong service integrity based on the ledger contents. Even if some replicas are corrupt or their keys are compromised, they can be blamed based on their signed evidence of malicious activity recorded in the ledger. CCF supports transparent, programmable governance where the power of the consortium members is tunable and their activity is similarly recorded in the ledger for full auditability. We are developing an open-source implementation of CCF based on SGX-enabled Azure Confidential Compute, built on top of the Open Enclave SDK.

Extending visual Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) with other modalities such as an inertial measurement unit (IMU) can boost robustness and accuracy. However, for a tight sensor fusion, accurate time synchronization of the sensors is often crucial. Changing exposure times, internal sensor filtering, multiple clock sources and unpredictable delays from operation system scheduling and data transfer can make sensor synchronization challenging. In this paper, we present VersaVIS, an Open Versatile Multi-Camera Visual-Inertial Sensor Suite aimed to be an efficient research platform for easy deployment, integration and extension for many mobile robotic applications. VersaVIS provides a complete, open-source hardware, firmware and software bundle to perform time synchronization of multiple cameras with an IMU featuring exposure compensation, host clock translation and independent and stereo camera triggering. The sensor suite supports a wide range of cameras and IMUs to match the requirements of the application. The synchronization accuracy of the framework is evaluated on multiple experiments achieving timing accuracy of less than 1 ms. Furthermore, the applicability and versatility of the sensor suite is demonstrated in multiple applications including visual-inertial SLAM, multi-camera applications, multi-modal mapping, reconstruction and object based mapping.",,,versavis—an open versatile multi-camera visual-inertial sensor suite,10.3390/s20051439

But we must overcome major challenges before we can benefit from this opportunity. Embedded processors are severely resource constrained. Their nearest mobile counterparts exhibit at least a 100---1,000x difference in compute capability, memory availability, and power consumption. As a result, the machine-learning (ML) models and associated ML inference framework must not only execute efficiently but also operate in a few kilobytes of memory. Also, the embedded devices' ecosystem is heavily fragmented. To maximize efficiency, system vendors often omit many features that commonly appear in mainstream systems, including dynamic memory allocation and virtual memory, that allow for cross-platform interoperability. The hardware comes in many flavors (e.g., instruction-set architecture and FPU support, or lack thereof). We introduce TensorFlow Lite Micro (TF Micro), an open-source ML inference framework for running deep-learning models on embedded systems. TF Micro tackles the efficiency requirements imposed by embedded-system resource constraints and the fragmentation challenges that make cross-platform interoperability nearly impossible. The framework adopts a unique interpreter-based approach that provides flexibility while overcoming these challenges. This paper explains the design decisions behind TF Micro and describes its implementation details. Also, we present an evaluation to demonstrate its low resource requirement and minimal run-time performance overhead.",,,tensorflow lite micro: embedded machine learning on tinyml systems,

The most significant performance gains are enabled by optimizations to BOOM’s execution path and a redesign of the instruction fetch unit with a new hardware implementation of the state-of-the-art TAGE branch predictor algorithm. Additionally, Sonic BOOM provides the first open implementation of a load-store unit that can provide multiple loads per cycle. With these optimizations and new features, Sonic BOOM can achieve 2x higher IPC on SPEC CPU benchmarks compared to any prior open-source out-of-order core.

Yet, state-of-the-art systems do not offer strong security or struggle with frequent domain crossings and oftentimes intrusive kernel modiﬁcations. We propose Donky, an efﬁcient hardware-software co-design for strong in-process isolation based on dynamic memory protection domains. The two components of our design are a secure software framework and a non-intrusive hardware extension. We facilitate domain switches entirely in userspace, thus minimizing switching overhead as well as kernel complexity. We show the versatility of Donky in three realistic use cases, secure V8 sandboxing, software vaults, and untrusted third-party libraries. We provide an open-source implementation on a RISC-V Ariane CPU and an Intel-MPK-based emulation mode for x86. We evaluate the security and performance of our implementation for RISC-V synthesized on an FPGA. We also evaluate the performance on x86 and show why our new design is more secure than Intel MPK. Donky does not impede the runtime of in-domain computation. Cross-domain switches are 16–116x faster than regular process context switches. Fully protecting the mbedTLS cryptographic operations has a 4 % overhead.",,,donky: domain keys - efficient in-process isolation for risc-v and x86,

We address this problem by proposing an open-source robotic platform which can safely operate without human supervision. The hardware is inexpensive (about \SI{5000}[\$]{}) yet highly dynamic, robust, and capable of complex interaction with external objects. The software operates at 1-kilohertz and performs safety checks to prevent the hardware from breaking. The easy-to-use front-end (in C++ and Python) is suitable for real-time control as well as deep reinforcement learning. In addition, the software framework is largely robot-agnostic and can hence be used independently of the hardware proposed herein.

Early and accurate diagnosis of Covid-19 is crucial in reducing the spread of the disease and its accompanied mortality. Currently, detection by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) is the gold standard of outpatient and inpatient detection of Covid-19. RT-PCR is a rapid method, however, its accuracy in detection is only ~70-75%. Another approved strategy is computed tomography (CT) imaging. CT imaging has a much higher sensitivity of ~80-98%, but similar accuracy of 70%. To enhance the accuracy of CT imaging detection, we developed an open-source set of algorithms called CovidCTNet that successfully differentiates Covid-19 from community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) and other lung diseases. CovidCTNet increases the accuracy of CT imaging detection to 90% compared to radiologists (70%). The model is designed to work with heterogeneous and small sample sizes independent of the CT imaging hardware. In order to facilitate the detection of Covid-19 globally and assist radiologists and physicians in the screening process, we are releasing all algorithms and parametric details in an open-source format.

The pressure accuracy, stability, and resolution are 0.09%, 0.02%, and 0.02% of the full span, respectively. The settling time to reach 2 bar from zero and stabilize is less than 2 s. Material for building a four-channel mu Pump (approx. $3000 USD) or an eight-channel mu Pump (approx. $5000 USD) is approximately a quarter, or a third of the cost of buying a high-end commercial system, respectively. The design rationale is presented, together with documented design details and software, so that the system may be replicated or customized to particular applications. mu Pump can be used for two-phase droplet microfluidics, single-phase microfluidics, gaseous flow microfluidics and any other applications requiring precise fluid handling. mu Pump provides researchers, students, and startups with a cost-effective solution for precise fluid control.

However, the use of laboratory automation in academic laboratories is limited due to high acquisition costs and the inability to customize off-the-shelf hardware. To address these challenges, we present an Open Source Hardware concept, referred to as OpenWorkstation, to build an assembly line-inspired platform consisting of ready-to-use and customizable modules. In contrast to current standalone solutions, the OpenWorkstation concept enables the combination of single hardware modules - each with a specific set of functionalities - to a modular workstation to provide a fully automated setup. The base setup consists of a pipetting and transport module and is designed to execute basic protocol steps for in vitro research applications, including pipetting operations for liquids and viscous substances and transportation of cell culture vessels between the modules. We demonstrate the successful application of this concept within a case study by the development of a storage module to facilitate high-throughput studies and a photo-crosslinker module to initiate photo-induced polymerization of hydrogel solutions. We present a Systems Engineering framework for customized module development, guidance for the design and assembly of the presented modules, and operational instructions on the usage of the workstation. By combining capabilities from various open source instrumentations into a modular technology platform, the OpenWorkstation concept will facilitate efficient and reliable experimentation for in vitro research. Ultimately, this concept will allow academic groups to improve replicability and reproducibility in cell culture process operations towards more economical and innovative research in the future.

Extending visual Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) with other modalities such as an inertial measurement unit (IMU) can boost robustness and accuracy. However, for a tight sensor fusion, accurate time synchronization of the sensors is often crucial. Changing exposure times, internal sensor filtering, multiple clock sources and unpredictable delays from operation system scheduling and data transfer can make sensor synchronization challenging. In this paper, we present VersaVIS, an Open Versatile Multi-Camera Visual-Inertial Sensor Suite aimed to be an efficient research platform for easy deployment, integration and extension for many mobile robotic applications. VersaVIS provides a complete, open-source hardware, firmware and software bundle to perform time synchronization of multiple cameras with an IMU featuring exposure compensation, host clock translation and independent and stereo camera triggering. The sensor suite supports a wide range of cameras and IMUs to match the requirements of the application. The synchronization accuracy of the framework is evaluated on multiple experiments achieving timing accuracy of less than 1 ms. Furthermore, the applicability and versatility of the sensor suite is demonstrated in multiple applications including visual-inertial SLAM, multi-camera applications, multi-modal mapping, reconstruction and object based mapping.",,,versavis-an open versatile multi-camera visual-inertial sensor suite,10.3390/s20051439

Microarchitectural covert channels exploit changes in execution timing resulting from competing access to limited hardware resources. We use the recent experimental support for time protection, aimed at preventing covert channels, in the seL4 microkernel and evaluate the efficacy of the mechanisms against five known channels on Ariane, an open-source 64-bit application-class RISC-V core. We confirm that without hardware support, these defences are expensive and incomplete. We show that the addition of a single-instruction extension to the RISC-V ISA, that flushes microarchitectural state, can enable the OS to close all five evaluated covert channels with low increase in context switch costs and negligible hardware overhead. We conclude that such a mechanism is essential for security.",,,prevention of microarchitectural covert channels on an open-source 64-bit risc-v core,

Today, developments in NdFeb magnets have caused these magnets to become essential elements in many technology fields. NdFeB magnets are widely used in the engines of hybrid electric vehicles due to the maximum energy product (BHmax). In addition, usage of NdFeB in applications such as magnetic resonance imaging, electric motors, various generators and in large-scale or small-scale wind energy generators have increased significantly. In this study, before the production of NdFeB magnets, a virtual laboratory platform which can be used in research and development studies and production is realized.The developed virtual platform is designed and run as a desktop application. In future studies, web based applications will be developed by using open source hardware.In the study, mathematical functions were obtained from data related to B-r(permanent magnetism), H-c(magnetic coercivity), BHmax, and Curie temperature obtained in researches on different NdFeB alloys in real laboratory.The virtual laboratory platform was prepared with the obtained functions. The laboratory system can be used in industry for multi-purpose. In addition, it also allows for use for educational purposes.

Many (Abadi et al., 2016; Chen et al., 2015; Jia et al., 2014; Paszke et al., 2017) offer a dataflow DAG abstraction for specifying NN workloads and provide optimization support for inference as well as training with automatic differentiation. These frameworks significantly reduce development cycles for deep learning algorithms and thus facilitate innovations in deep learning. However, a majority of these frameworks (Chen et al., 2015; Jia et al., 2014; Paszke et al., 2017) adopt a library-based approach that maps the NN operations to hardware through existing high-performance libraries, such as cuDNN (Chetlur et al., 2014) for GPUs, and GEMMLOWP (Jacob et al., 2017) and NNPACK (Dukhan, 2016) for CPUs. These libraries currently do not support low-precision inference (INT4), and since they are not open source we could not add that functionality. As such, for our analysis we adopted to use TVM (Chen et al., 2018), which provides a general graph and a tensor expression intermediate representation (IR) to support automatic code transformation and generation. TVM also equips a QNN dialect (Jain et al., 2020) to compile the quantization-specific operators of a quantized model. We choose TVM as our deployment framework for several reasons including: (i) its extensive support in the frontend high-level frameworks and the backend hardware platforms; and (ii) its decoupled IR abstraction that separates the algorithm specifications and the scheduling decisions. Augmenting TVM with our mixed-precision quantization support allows this optimization to be used by NNs written in different frameworks as well as for various target hardware platforms. In addition, the decoupled IR design in TVM allows the mixed-precision quantization optimization to be applied without affecting the specification of algorithms.",,,hawq-v3: dyadic neural network quantization,

In this work, we address a less well understood and studied question: how does our choice of tooling introduce randomness to deep neural network training. We conduct large scale experiments across different types of hardware, accelerators, state of art networks, and open-source datasets, to characterize how tooling choices contribute to the level of non-determinism in a system, the impact of said non-determinism, and the cost of eliminating different sources of noise. Our findings are surprising, and suggest that the impact of non-determinism in nuanced. While top-line metrics such as top-1 accuracy are not noticeably impacted, model performance on certain parts of the data distribution is far more sensitive to the introduction of randomness. Our results suggest that deterministic tooling is critical for AI safety. However, we also find that the cost of ensuring determinism varies dramatically between neural network architectures and hardware types, e.g., with overhead up to $746\%$, $241\%$, and $196\%$ on a spectrum of widely used GPU accelerator architectures, relative to non-deterministic training.

The novel aspect of the nanoPU is the design of a fast path between the network and applications—bypassing the cache and memory hierarchy, and placing arriving messages directly into the CPU register ﬁle. This fast path contains programmable hardware support for low latency transport and congestion control as well as hardware support for efﬁcient load balancing of RPCs to cores. A hardware-accelerated thread scheduler makes sub-nanosecond decisions, leading to high CPU utilization and low tail response time for RPCs. We built an FPGA prototype of the nanoPU fast path by modifying an open-source RISC-V CPU, and evaluated its performance using cycle-accurate simulations on AWS FPGAs. The wire-to-wire RPC response time through the nanoPU is just 69ns, an order of magnitude quicker than the best-of-breed, low latency, commercial NICs. We demonstrate that the hardware thread scheduler is able to lower RPC tail response time by about 5 × while enabling the system to sustain 20% higher load, relative to traditional thread scheduling techniques. We implement and evaluate a suite of applications, including MICA, Raft and Set Algebra for document retrieval; and we demonstrate that the nanoPU can be used as a high performance, programmable alternative for one-sided RDMA operations.",,,the nanopu: a nanosecond network stack for datacenters,

However, the traditional MEC architecture relies on specialized hardware and its bespoke software functions are closely integrated with the hardware, hence it is too rigid for supporting the rapidly evolving scenarios in the face of the demanding requirements of 6G. As a remedy, we conceive the compelling concept of open-source cellular networking and intrinsically amalgamate it with MEC, which is defined by open-source software running on general-purpose hardware platforms. Specifically, an open-source MEC (OS-MEC) scheme is presented relying on a pair of core principles: the decoupling of the MEC functions and resources from each other with the aid of network function virtualization (NFV); as well as the reconfiguration of the disaggregated MEC functions and resources into customized edge instances. This philosophy allows operators to adaptively customize their users' networks. Then, we develop improved networking functions for OS-MEC decoupling and discuss both its key components as well as the process of OS-MEC reconfiguration.

Students can implement the packet processing pipeline themselves, without prior knowledge of circuit design. However, when choosing a P4 programmable target for use in the classroom, instructors face a lack of options. On the one hand, software solutions, such as the behavioral model (BMv2) switch, are overly simplified and offer low performance. On the other hand, existing hardware solutions are closed source and expensive. In this paper, we present P4Pi, a new, low-cost, open-source hardware platform intended for networking education. P4Pi allows students to design and deploy P4-based network devices using the Raspberry Pi board, which has a price tag of less than many academic textbooks. We describe the high-level design of the P4Pi platform, offer some suggestions for how P4Pi could be used in the classroom, and present some additional use-cases for applications and functionality that could be developed using P4Pi.",,,p4pi: p4 on raspberry pi for networking education,

It is usually measured using expensive laboratory equipment. This method, which gives information about the material, is also used quite a lot in medical applications. However, laboratory equipment used in this measurement is often costly. Low-cost laboratory equipment for data acquisition with open-source hardware and software is a lifesaver for the low-budget research projects. Although there are many data acquisition hardware and software in the market, most of them are complex and expensive. They contain many extra features other than some specific ones required for transmission rate measurement. In this study, X-ray transmission rate measurement of some chemical compounds was carried out using a low-cost laboratory counter and data acquisition software. The results are shown by experiments and are consistent with the catalogue values of the materials and chemical compounds used. Thus, in this paper a method is proposed for both measuring the thickness of the material with known linear attenuation coefficient and measuring the linear attenuation coefficient for a material with known thickness.",,,x-ray transmission-rate-measuring by using low-cost laboratory counter,

Recent attacks on processors have shown the fatal consequences of uncovering and exploiting hardware vulnerabilities. Fuzzing has emerged as a promising technique for detecting software vulnerabilities. Recently, a few hardware fuzzing techniques have been proposed. However, they suffer from several limitations, including non-applicability to commonly used Hardware Description Languages (HDLs) like Verilog and VHDL, the need for significant human intervention, and inability to capture many intrinsic hardware behaviors, such as signal transitions and floating wires. In this paper, we present the design and implementation of a novel hardware fuzzer, TheHuzz, that overcomes the aforementioned limitations and significantly improves the state of the art. We analyze the intrinsic behaviors of hardware designs in HDLs and then measure the coverage metrics that model such behaviors. TheHuzz generates assembly-level instructions to increase the desired coverage values, thereby finding many hardware bugs that are exploitable from software. We evaluate TheHuzz on four popular open-source processors and achieve 1.98x and 3.33x the speed compared to the industry-standard random regression approach and the state-of-the-art hardware fuzzer, DiffuzRTL, respectively. Using TheHuzz, we detected 11 bugs in these processors, including 8 new vulnerabilities, and we demonstrate exploits using the detected bugs. We also show that TheHuzz overcomes the limitations of formal verification tools from the semiconductor industry by comparing its findings to those discovered by the Cadence JasperGold tool.",,,thehuzz: instruction fuzzing of processors using golden-reference models for finding software-exploitable vulnerabilities,

They are seen as a key to advancements in such fields. A robotic is being used to assure precision and reliability. Some bigger companies like amazon use robotics to achieve stability and speed up their productions. In real-life, robots are mostly used in environments that contain uncertainties events. Additionally, interruptions occur there. Determining several performance quantities such as the execution time, throughput, power dissipation and energy under severe circumstances is crucial in the fields where robotics are used. This paper uses the developed framework earlier on a robotic manipulator to estimate average power dissipation, also known as power consumption, and average energy. Subsequently, a comparison analysis is conducted using several free tools such as Power Gadget, HW Monitor, Sidebar Diagnostics and Open Hardware Monitor. Those free tools are chosen since they are available with no extra hidden charges, and they are easy to download and use. The aim of that analysis is to find the differences between the average estimated value using mathematical equations and the actual ones from those tools. The analysis is performed on a machine running on a Windows based system. The results that obtained indicate that the estimated/predicted values of the dissipated power and energy are close to the actual values. Likewise, the error between those figures varies between 6% to 11%. This variation happens because the used machine is affected by its specifications, especially the number of cores of its CPU and the clock frequency.",,,evaluation of power dissipation and energy in a robotic system,

Since 2004, Snail Aid has been working on Disarmadillo, a dramatic shift in paradigm: an open source hardware platform for humanitarian demining. Developed mainly thanks to volunteers' work across more than 15 years, the machine is now going to get a push thanks to the project Disarmadillo+, in collaboration between Snail Aid - Technology for Development and the Italian Institute of Technology. The new version of the machine will be improved in terms of manoeuvrability, modularity, versatility, without compromising its characteristic features. The re-design will take into account the need of keeping the cost low and the technology appropriate to the context where it will work. The ability of the machine to serve two different purposes will also be preserved: the machine will keep on being easily convertible to its original agricultural nature, being developed around a commercial off-the-shelf powertiller. The paper presents the machine and the research work foreseen within the new project.",,,"disarmadillo: an open source, sustainable, robotic platform for humanitarian demining",

This manuscript concerns designing a wireless sensor network system that facilitates open-source hardware platforms, ZigBee and Raspberry Pi. The embedded system architecture combines the gateway node of the wireless sensor network, database server, and web server in one single-board computer (SBC) hardware platform. The design reduces power consumption and cost by developing better scalability and lesser sensors units to improve sending and receiving data. The use of Raspberry Pi in the design enhances flexibility and reduces the cost. Further, using the Python code in programming minimizes the codes of the components and avoids errors. The choice of the Raspbian operating system for Raspberries has resulted in higher quality, better stability, and a smoother scalable operating system. Raspberry Pi acts as a base station for the ZigBee protocol. Additionally, data can be transferred remotely at the base station via the website. The advantage of using python in the programming makes the work on the Raspberry easier and faster, and the language learning becomes easier than before. The other advantage of this technique is to allow sending the data to any Raspberry by clicking special buttons on the GUI, capability to work with both multicast-and unicast-based communication schemes, and to work as router and end tag(E52) to enable sending the real-time data to the nearest router. Analytically, the new design provides a maximum transmit power of 20 dBm12 compared to 18 dBs and increase the output power increases by a little more than 2 dB.",,,designing an embedded wireless sensor network platform using single board computer application,

Combined, the IoT provided the means and methodologies, while the Arduino offered an easy-to-use, easy-to-program system which led to an ascending trend for both. After more than ten years of successful collaboration between IoT and Arduino systems, several new competitors launched development boards created especially for IoT. The most popular are Raspberry Pi Pico, ESP8266, STM32, etc. This paper applied a multicriterial analysis (MCA) to rank the performances of the development mentioned above boards in the IoT context.

Purpose: To develop and test a suite of open‐source hardware and software tools for the measurement, characterization, reporting, and correction of geometric distortion in MRI. Methods: An open‐source python library was developed, comprising modules for parametric phantom design, data processing, spherical harmonics, distortion correction, and interactive reporting. The code was used to design and manufacture a distortion phantom consisting of 618 oil filled markers covering a sphere of radius 150 mm. This phantom was imaged on a CT scanner and a novel split‐bore 1.0 T MRI magnet. The CT images provide distortion‐free dataset. These data were used to test all modules of the open‐source software. Results: All markers were successfully extracted from all images. The distorted MRI markers were mapped to undistorted CT data using an iterative search approach. Spherical harmonics reconstructed the fitted gradient data to 1.0 ± 0.6% of the input data. High resolution data were reconstructed via spherical harmonics and used to generate an interactive report. Finally, distortion correction on an independent data set reduced distortion inside the DSV from 5.5 ± 3.1 to 1.6 ± 0.8 mm.

In the presented work, we have proposed a simple system for microscopy utilising open-source platform Arduino. Testing this system showed that it had sufficient sensitivity to determine the physical processes occurring in a cryopreserved sample such as intra- and extracellular water crystallisation and salt eutectic. Utilising this system, we investigated the mechanisms of cryoprotection and cryodamage of testis interstitial cells (ICs) in cryoprotective media, which included cryoprotective agents such as dimethyl sulphoxide (Me2SO), as well as foetal bovine serum or polymers (dextran, hydroxyethyl starch and polyethylene glycol). It was shown that a serum-/xeno-free medium that included 0.7 M Me2SO and 100 mg/mL dextran was able to reduce intracellular water crystallisation in cells, change the structure of extracellular ice, and reduce salt eutectic and recrystallisation. All these effects correlated with better IC survival after cryopreservation in the medium. This medium is potentially less toxic as it has lower concentrations of Me2SO compared to serum-containing media developed for cryopreservation of testicular cells. This would pave a way for the creation of nontoxic serum-free compositions that does not require removal before use of cryopreserved living cells for laboratory practice or in clinics. Research in the field of cryobiology involves many technics linked with the assessment of cell recovery after cooling/warming as well as quantification, identification and description of physical processes occurring in and out of the cells. These processes can affect the overall outcome of cryopreservation. Thus, the investigation of the mechanisms of cryoprotection and cryodamage is of high importance. In this work, we have developed a system for cryomicroscopy utilising open-source platform for prototyping electronic devices and systems Arduino. The platform includes hardware and software designed to develop various projects. It also supports a programming language. The language was used to create a code to control cooling rate of the sample undergoing microscopy. The system was able to visualise the structure of the forming ice crystals, recrystallisation, salt eutectic crystallisation/melting and intracellular phase transitions. It can be utilised in combination with other approaches and techniques. The system helped us to solve specific tasks of cryobiological experimentation connected with the establishment of mechanisms of cryoprotection and cryodamage of testis interstitial cells (ICs). The microscopy data allowed us to compare different media developed for cryopreservation of testicular cells. The serum-containing cryoprotective medium (1.4 M Me2SO and 10% foetal bowine serum) was able to suppress darkening of cell, known as 'flashing' associated with intracellular phase transitions by moderately dehydrating cells, and salt eutectic transitions during cooling/warming. However, the media contains relatively high Me2SO concentration and may be toxic. Additionally, the use of serum in the media can result in transferring infection when cryopreserved cells are used in medicine or veterinary, or lead to instability of the composition of serum-containing media from batch to batch. In the course of the research, we have shown that using the serum-/xeno-free medium supplemented with 0.7 M Me2SO and 100 mg/mL Dex (0.7 Me2SO+Dex) can also reduce cell 'flashing'. The medium influenced the size and shape of extracellular ice crystals in a way that can potentially reduce the risk of mechanical cell damage. This medium promoted amorphous solidification in the space between the extracellular ice crystals, thus, lowering the salt eutectic transitions and recrystallisation that could otherwise cause additional cell damage. Therefore, application of the developed system for cryomicroscopy, which allowed real-time visualisation of cryobiological processes, made it possible to draw a conclusion about cryoprotecitive properties of medium for ICs. 0.7 Me2SO+Dex can be the basis for the creation of commercial serum-free media with a defined composition that does not require removal before use.",,,open-source hardware- and software-based cryomicroscopy system for investigation of phase transitions in cryobiological research,10.1111/jmi.13253

The second is an automatic layer -by -layer hybridization enabled by the software ""SuperSlicer"". This method requires no machining knowledge but only allows contouring operations. Results of experiments show that the spindle presented in this work is capable of successfully carrying out a hybrid process that significantly improves the surface roughness parameters, with an improvement factor of 10 for most parameters. An uniformization of surface roughness parameters was also observed in the construction direction and in the deposition/machining direction. The layer -by -layer hybridization yields the better results in terms of surface roughness.

The traditional view is that there is a choice between virtualization with strong security and high overhead, and container technologies with weaker security and minimal overhead. This tradeoff is unacceptable to public infrastructure providers, who need both strong security and minimal overhead. To meet this need, we developed Fire-cracker, a new open source Virtual Machine Monitor (VMM) specialized for serverless workloads, but generally useful for containers, functions and other compute workloads within a reasonable set of constraints.

Research on open source software has focused mainly on the motivations of open source programmers and the organization of open source projects Some researchers portray open source as an extension of the earlier open systems movement (West and Dedrick, 2001). While there has been some research on open-systems software adoption by corporate MIS organizations (Chau and Tam, 1997), the issue of open source adoption has received little attention. We use a series of interviews with MIS managers to develop a grounded theory of open source platform adoption. We then place our findings within the contexts of diffusion of innovation and economics of standards theories. INTRODUCTION For technology users, standards adoption decisions have important consequences. Adopting a winning standard enables users to benefit from a sustained stream of producer investment in the technology and access to a large supply of complementary assets. For instance, users of Microsoft Windows benefit from R&D in computer hardware and software on the Windows platform, as well as access to the immense library of Windows applications.

This paper presents a general-purpose open-source crypto coprocessor capable of securely performing crypto operations such as key management, certificate creation and handling, and email encryption, decryption, and signing, at a cost one to two orders of magnitude below that of commercial equivalents while providing generally equivalent performance and a higher level of functionality. The paper examines various issues involved in designing the coprocessor, and explores options for hardware acceleration of crypto operations for extended performance above and beyond that offered by the basic coprocessor’s COTS hardware.",,,proceedings of the 9th usenix security symposium,
