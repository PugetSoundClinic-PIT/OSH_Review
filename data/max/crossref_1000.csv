As a company dedicated to quality, Lucas is constantly re‐evaluating its practices to determine opportunities for improvement. In doing so, Lucas has taken great leaps in its technological approach, most recently by its conversion from McDonnell Douglas hardware to the IBM RS6000 with the help of Kewill‐Trifid's IBS manufacturing and business software. The change to Open Systems was the calculated result of extensive research and testing, but the resulting degree of success was unprecedented. The company plays an integral role in the aviation and defence industries in Great Britain and around the world. As the Engineering and Heating Systems Division of Lucas Aerospace Ltd., Lucas Luton's function is twofold: manufacturing aircraft transparencies for cockpits and cabins for civil and military aircraft, for example the Tornado canopy and A320 pilot cabin windows; and producing de‐icing systems for aircraft — an application that stops ice forming on aircraft engine intakes, wings and also on helicopter blades. Lucas also currently possesses the contract to develop screens for the European Fighter Aircraft, and it provides anti‐icing systems for the Concorde, the EH 101 helicopter for Westland Helicopters, and the V22 tilt rotor helicopter in the United States. As recent recipients of both a British Quality Award and a National Training Award, Lucas clearly shows that its commitment to its people — their training, development and job satisfaction — is equal in importance to their production of an excellent quality product.","https://www.emerald.com/insight/content/doi/10.1108/eb037237/full/html",""

These gains in performance have come at a cost of increase in computational complexity and memory bandwidth. Recent studies have explored the fixed-point implementation of DNN algorithms such as AlexNet and VGG on Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) to facilitate the potential of deployment on embedded system. However, there are still lacking research on DNN object detection algorithms on FPGA. Consequently, we propose the implementation of Tiny-Yolo-v2 on Cyclone V PCIe FPGA board using the High-Level Synthesis Tool: Intel FPGA Software Development Kit (SDK) for OpenCL. In this work, a systematic approach is proposed to convert the floating point Tiny-Yolo-v2 algorithms into 8-bit fixed-point. Our experiments show that the 8-bit fixed-point Tiny-Yolo-v2 have significantly reduce the hardware consumption with only 0.3% loss in accuracy. Finally, our implementation achieves peak performance of 31.34 Giga Operation per Second (GOPS) and comparable performance density of 0.28GOPs/DSP to prior works under 120MHz working frequency.","https://www.ijrte.org/wp-content/uploads/papers/v8i2S6/B11500782S619.pdf",""

It combines: (i) custom printed circuit boards (PCBs) with RFM69 frequency shift keying (FSK) radio frequency (RF) transceivers for wireless sensors, control nodes, and USB gateway, (ii) a Raspberry Pi 3B with custom firmware acting as either a centralized or distributed backhaul, and (iii) a custom dockerized application for the backend called Brood that serves as the director software managing message brokering via Message Queuing Telemetry Transport (MQTT) protocol using VerneMQ, database storage using InfluxDB, and data visualization using Grafana. The platform is built around the idea of a private, secure, and open technology for the built environment. Among its many applications, the platform allows occupants to investigate anomalies in energy usage, environmental quality, and thermal performance via a comprehensive dashboard with rich querying capabilities. It also includes multiple frontends to view and analyze building activity data, which can be used directly in building controls or to provide recommendations on how to increase operational efficiency or improve operating conditions. Here, we demonstrate three distinct applications of the Elemental platform, including: (1) deployment in a research lab for long-term data collection and automated analysis, (2) use as a full-home energy and environmental monitoring solution, and (3) fault and anomaly detection and diagnostics of individual building systems at the zone-level. Through these applications we demonstrate that the platform allows easy and virtually unlimited datalogging, monitoring, and analysis of real-time sensor data with low setup costs. Low-power sensor nodes placed in abundance in a building can also provide precise and immediate fault-detection, allowing for tuning equipment for more efficient operation and faster maintenance during the lifetime of the building.","https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/19/18/4017/pdf",""

In several countries, governments have begun to recognize the importance of OSS and have started to adopt explicit policies on OSS (Cook & Horobin, 2006). Open Source Software holds several compelling benefits for businesses. Information on wide-ranging use and examples of OSS in organizations are scattered and sometimes skewed to a few OSS.

We propose a novel software architecture based on open-software hardware platforms which allows programmers to create data streams from input channels and easily implement filters and frequency analysis objects. The performances of the different classes given in the size of memory allocated and execution time (number of clock cycles) were analyzed in the low-cost platform Arduino Genuino. In addition, 11 people took part in an experiment in which they had to implement several exercises and complete a usability test. Sampling rates under 250 Hz (typical for many biomedical applications) makes it feasible to implement filters, sliding windows and Fourier analysis, operating in real time. Participants rated software usability at 70.2 out of 100 and the ease of use when implementing several signal processing applications was rated at just over 4.4 out of 5. Participants showed their intention of using this software because it was percieved as useful and very easy to use. The performances of the library showed that it may be appropriate for implementing small biomedical real-time applications or for human movement monitoring, even in a simple open-source hardware device like Arduino Genuino. The general perception about this library is that it is easy to use and intuitive.","https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/18/4/1033/pdf",""

Methods ― in this experiment wound irrigation with antiseptic, oxidizing antiseptic and osmotically active agents with subsequent exposure and drainage was performed using the novel device. Efficacy of the proposed hardware-software system was evaluated by comparing it with standard wound dressings by planimetry and wound biopsy results. Results ― according to study results the novel device reduces the time of wound healing by 26.1%, while the time to wound proliferation is 1.7 times shorter when compared with standard wound dressings. Conclusion ― the proposed method stimulates wound repair and limits purulent inflammation in infected wounds. Using the novel method of superficial wound management helps to prevent the development of re-infection and suppuration.","",""

However, the fabrication of DIBs is currently hindered by time-consuming processes and specialized equipment. These fabrication limitations prevent the scale-up of DIB assays, making it difficult to generate the large data sets required to achieve statistically significant conclusions in single-molecule biological assays where heterogeneous behaviour is often observed. This research describes an open-source solution, dubbed “DIB-BOT,” constructed by coupling a nanoinjector with an entry-level 3D printer. We present DIB-BOT as a platform to achieve rapid, reproducible, and reliable fabrication of large numbers of DIBs, addressing the limitations of manual methods. Leveraging commercially available off-the-shelf components, DIB-BOT exhibits high spatial reproducibility, minimal user input, and the ability to scale experiments rapidly. Here we demonstrate the utility of the system by integrating pairwise droplet assembly with a fluorescence plate-reader to execute a biologically relevant assay. When compared with manual DIB fabrication, the DIB-BOT had a tenfold reduction in droplet volume error, a threefold reduction in positional error, and 100% droplet yield. Overall, this method has potential to reduce entry barriers to the use of DIB methods, broadening the applications of DIB research, and generating higher quality data sets.","https://syndication.highwire.org/content/doi/10.1101/2024.01.26.577347",""

These include expansions from software into general culture through ‘Free Culture’ movements and, more recently, expansions from software into hardware and design. This article provides a critical perspective on the democratic potential of these broader ‘open’ contribution structures by examining how open source contributions to both software and hardware increase the opportunities for democratic participation in production, governance and knowledge exchange. By analysing attempts to ‘open source’ the sharing of hardware designs, it also notes the limitations of this democratization. The insights developed in the article nuance the relationship between open source cultures and commercial and market structures, identifying how the generative opportunities created by certain aspects of open source contribution structures increase the potential for democratizing production of communication tools, but also how incongruities across different open-source cultures and communities of practice limit the democratic potential of these processes.","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/0163443712449497",""

A 34-year-old man presented with pain and swelling of the left leg, where he had previously sustained an open tibia fracture 1 year prior. After the initial injury, he underwent four corrective surgeries (including bone graft and internal-fixation) and was asymptomatic for 6 months before these new symptoms developed. MRI revealed a 6.5 × 5.1 × 2.7 cm abscess and tibial osteomyelitis. Surgical staff performed an aggressive incision and drainage (I&D) with saucerization of the tibia, to treat what seemed to be a routine hardware infection. Five days later, tissue cultures grew Brucella melitensis. Upon further questioning, the patient described butchering a wild boar 10 days prior to symptom onset. Methods: The CDC provides guidance on serological testing and post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) for persons exposed to Brucella in the laboratory setting. Upon identification of this patient’s Brucella isolates, infection control staff identified all laboratory workers that met CDC criteria for “high risk” exposure, as well as other healthcare workers (HCW) exposed to aerosolized infectious material (including those workers in the operating room during pulse lavage of the abscess). Results: Staff identified 34 HCW with presumed high-risk exposure, including 19 laboratory personnel, 13 operating room personnel, and two patient care technicians. Baseline serology was obtained on all 34 HCW, and PEP with rifampin and doxycycline was prescribed for each. Nine of the exposed employees changed PEP therapy due to intolerance, and follow-up serology was obtained on 32 of the 34 healthcare workers, with zero seroconversions found. Conclusion: Brucellosis is a rare disease in clinical practice, so a high index of suspicion is necessary to enact appropriate precautions before widespread exposures. When exposure is identified after the fact, efficient protocols should be in place to identify all susceptible individuals. Due to the low infectious dose of Brucella melitensis, CDC guidance should be expanded to include aerosolizing procedures outside of the laboratory.

This paper presents our user-friendly and open-source web-based digital design tool, SHDL, which is used to describe and simulate hardware components and translate them into a standard language. SHDL is a teaching language and tool for digital design, which aims to improve the teaching and learning experience in digital systems design courses. The use and evaluation of the proposed online teaching model for the Digital Electronic Systems Design (DESD) course, using the SHDL tool for e-learning during the COVID-19 phase, is presented. Using the SHDL language and web tool, we have created many examples of digital circuits that prepare students to explore their own designs. The example components can also be used as digital system modules, leading to better modularity of the final project. The use of SHDL in the DESD course has shown that the proposed language leads to fewer syntax, simulation and synthesis errors in the designed circuits. The evaluation results show that at the end of the laboratory exercises, there was no longer a difference in knowledge between the students without prior VHDL experience and the other students. The results encourage us to continue using SHDL, and to complement the traditional DESD teaching methods with e-learning.","https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9292/12/2/425/pdf",""

In this paper we analyze the performances of open source firmware OpenWrt 21.x compared with a server-side operating system (Debian 11 x64) and Mikrotik 7.x, also virtualized, and different types of clients (Windows 10/11, iOS 15, Android 11, OpenWrt 21.x, Debian 11 x64 and Mikrotik 7.x), observing the performance of the network according to the current implementation of the various protocols and algorithms of VPN tunnel examined on what are the most recent HW and SW for deployment in outdoor locations with poor network connectivity. Specifically, operating systems provide different performance metric values for various combinations of configuration variables. The first pursued goal is to find the algorithms to guarantee a data transmission/encryption ratio as efficiently as possible. The second goal is to research the algorithms capable of guaranteeing the widest spectrum of compatibility with the current infrastructures that support VPN technology, to obtain a connection system secure for geographically scattered IoT networks spread over difficult-to-manage areas such as suburban or rural environments. The third goal is to be able to use open firmware on constrained routers that provide compatibility with different VPN protocols.","https://www.mdpi.com/1999-5903/14/9/264/pdf",""

Previous work in neuromorphic engineering mostly considered application-specific designs which is a strong limitation for researchers to develop novel applications and emulate the true behaviour of neuro-inspired systems. Hence to enable the fully parallel brain-like computations, this paper proposes a methodology where a spiking neuron model was emulated in software and electronic circuits were then implemented and characterized. The proposed approach offers a unique perspective whereby experimental measurements taken from a fabricated device allowing empirical models to be developed. This technique acts as a bridge between the theoretical and practical aspects of neuro-inspired devices. It is shown through software simulations and empirical modelling that the proposed technique is capable of replicating neural dynamics and post-synaptic potentials. Retrospectively, the proposed framework offers a first step towards open-source neuro-inspired hardware for a range of applications such as healthcare, applied machine learning and the internet of things (IoT).","https://ijres.iaescore.com/index.php/IJRES/article/viewFile/20470/pdf",""

Over a period of 11 years, the Centre has embarked on an initiative of upgrading and expanding the current network with combinations of broadband and/or strong motion sensors, high dynamic range digitizers and networking equipment to link each station to centralized observatories via high speed digital data transmission medium. To realize such an upgrade and expansion, the Centre has developed a seismic data acquisition system prototype built using open-source hardware and software tools. The prototype is intended to be low-cost using off the shelf hardware components and open-source seismic related software handling data acquisition and data processing in two separate modules. The prototype uses a three-channel accelerometer sensor and can process data into standard MiniSEED format for easy data archiving and seismic data analysis. A global position module provides network time protocol time synchronization within 1 millisecond for accurate timestamping of data. Data can be stored locally on the prototype in twenty-minute data files or securely transferred to a central location via internet with the use of virtual private network capabilities. The prototype is modular in design allowing for components to be replaced easily and the system software can be updated remotely thus reducing maintenance cost.","",""

However, UWB researchers are currently limited by the small amount of feasible open source hardware that is publicly available. We developed a new open source hardware platform, Wi-PoS, for precise UWB localization based on Decawave’s DW1000 UWB transceiver with several unique features: support of both long-range sub-GHz and 2.4 GHz back-end communication between nodes, flexible interfacing with external UWB antennas, and an easy implementation of the MAC layer with the Time-Annotated Instruction Set Computer (TAISC) framework. Both hardware and software are open source and all parameters of the UWB ranging can be adjusted, calibrated, and analyzed. This paper explains the main specifications of the hardware platform, illustrates design decisions, and evaluates the performance of the board in terms of range, accuracy, and energy consumption. The accuracy of the ranging system was below 10 cm in an indoor lab environment at distances up to 5 m, and accuracy smaller than 5 cm was obtained at 50 and 75 m in an outdoor environment. A theoretical model was derived for predicting the path loss and the influence of the most important ground reflection. At the same time, the average energy consumption of the hardware was very low with only 81 mA for a tag node and 63 mA for the active anchor nodes, permitting the system to run for several days on a mobile battery pack and allowing easy and fast deployment on sites without an accessible power supply or backbone network. The UWB hardware platform demonstrated flexibility, easy installation, and low power consumption.","https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/19/7/1548/pdf",""

A lack of affordable and adaptable tools in this area limits research progress and harmonized quality assurance. Purpose: To develop and test a suite of open‐source hardware and software tools for the measurement, characterization, reporting, and correction of geometric distortion in MRI. Methods: An open‐source python library was developed, comprising modules for parametric phantom design, data processing, spherical harmonics, distortion correction, and interactive reporting. The code was used to design and manufacture a distortion phantom consisting of 618 oil filled markers covering a sphere of radius 150 mm. This phantom was imaged on a CT scanner and a novel split‐bore 1.0 T MRI magnet. The CT images provide distortion‐free dataset. These data were used to test all modules of the open‐source software. Results: All markers were successfully extracted from all images. The distorted MRI markers were mapped to undistorted CT data using an iterative search approach. Spherical harmonics reconstructed the fitted gradient data to 1.0 ± 0.6% of the input data. High resolution data were reconstructed via spherical harmonics and used to generate an interactive report. Finally, distortion correction on an independent data set reduced distortion inside the DSV from 5.5 ± 3.1 to 1.6 ± 0.8 mm. Conclusion: Open‐source hardware and software for the measurement, characterization, reporting, and correction of geometric distortion in MRI have been developed. The utility of these tools has been demonstrated via their application on a novel 1.0 T split bore magnet.","https://aapm.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/mp.17342",""

Determining the optimal set of software and hardware components to evolve that (1) incorporate cutting-edge technology and (2) satisfy DRE system resource constraints, such as memory, power, and CPU usage is an NP-Hard problem. This article provides four contributions to evolving legacy DRE system configurations. First, we present the Software Evolution Analysis with Resources (SEAR) technique for converting legacy DRE system configurations, external resource availabilities, and candidate replacement components into multiple-choice multidimension knapsack problems (MMKP). Second, we present a formal methodology for assessing the validity of evolved system configurations. Third, we apply heuristic approximation algorithms to determine low-cost, high value evolution paths in polynomial time. Finally, we analyze results of experiments that apply these techniques to determine which technique is most effective for given system parameters. Our results show that constraint solvers can only evolve small system configurations, whereas approximation techniques are needed to evolve larger system configurations.","http://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.2478/s13537-011-0006-0.pdf",""

It includes at least prohibition of cartels — agreements between undertakings and concerted practices — of abuse of dominant position or ‘monopolization’, and merger control. These areas of antitrust differ considerably. Cartels require the coordinated effort of more than one undertaking, whereas abuse of dominant position is in principle a practice committed by a single undertaking. Enforcement of cartel and abuse of dominant position rules mostly apply ex post facto, when the illegal practices have displayed some of their effects. Conversely, merger control happens before a merger between two undertakings has become effective, requiring notification of certain deals before they are consummated, therefore it is mostly ex ante and it requires a notable amount of forward-looking evaluation by the antitrust authorities.","https://academic.oup.com/book/chapter-pdf/54406751/oso-9780198862345-chapter-17.pdf",""

Thus, this document describes the summarized research process for the development of an Internet of Things (IoT) system, which has been designed to promote an intelligent lighting service in an academic environment. The IoT system orchestrates a series of sensors, monitoring systems and controlled actions, all based on the principle of making the system functions and consumption records available in real-time, via web services. The devices used are ""Things"" with improved functionality, becoming ""Smart Things"" within the IoT paradigm. Methodologically, an experimental process was followed, linking the development of electronic tools, the construction of services, and the development of interfaces for a pleasant user experience. Research contributes to two essential areas: intelligent buildings, through the intelligent adaptation of an environment; and sustainability and eco-innovation, since the system provides appropriate information for environmental education, in terms of real-time energy consumption, that impacts directly on the fair-use culture of a service expensive for the environment.","https://revistas.uptc.edu.co/index.php/ingenieria/article/download/11060/9385",""

It was developed by the disordered materials group in the British spallation neutron source (ISIS) in 1980s, and aims to construct the most-probable atomic structures of disordered materials in the field of chemical physics. It has been extensively used during the past decades, and has generated reliable results. However, it implements a shared-memory architecture with open multi-processing (OpenMP). With the extensive construction of supercomputer clusters and the widespread use of graphics processing unit (GPU) acceleration technology, it is now possible to rebuild the EPSR with these techniques in the effort to improve its calculation speed. In this study, an open source framework NeuDATool is proposed. It is programmed in the object-oriented language C++, can be paralleled across nodes within a computer cluster, and supports GPU acceleration. The performance of NeuDATool has been tested with water and amorphous silica neutron scattering data. The test shows that the software can reconstruct the correct microstructure of the samples, and the calculation speed with GPU acceleration can increase by more than 400 times, compared with CPU serial algorithm at a simulation box that has about 100 thousand atoms. NeuDATool provides another choice to implement simulation in the (neutron) diffraction community, especially for experts who are familiar with C++ programming and want to define specific algorithms for their analysis.","https://pubs.aip.org/cps/cjcp/article-pdf/33/6/727/18112678/727_1_1674-0068_cjcp2005077.pdf",""

Those parameters are assessed objectively with commercial instrumentation such as computer‐assisted sperm analysis systems (CASA) and hemocytometer. In CASA systems, sperm motility is assessed in the horizontal plane imposed by the stage of the microscope. Thus, there is lack of measurement of the vertical velocity of sperm. The female reproductive tract is a tridimensional space which the sperm traverse to reach the ovum, and there is a need for instruments measuring parameters more relevant to this real‐world situation. In this report we describe the design, construction and use of an open‐source hardware (OSH) device for evaluation of the vertical velocity of sperm, called UPSPERM. This device was also used to measure sperm concentration, and agreement with hemocytometer was evaluated. Bland–Altman analysis shows good agreement between these two methods of sperm counting. As a first application of UPSPERM, we evaluated the changes in boar sperm motility at distinct pH values between 7.0 and 8.0. The UPSPERM results showed that the vertical velocity of sperm was highest at pH 7.6 and 7.8. We propose that our UPSPERM offers a reliable and affordable option for obtaining measurements of vertical velocity and sperm concentration.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/cyto.a.24343",""

They report the most popular approaches including software structure measures, process measures, and maturity assessment models. The way researchers have built their samples has also contributed to the mixed results with different project properties being considered and ignored. Because FLOSS projects evolve with each release, their quality does too, and it must be measured using metrics that take into account their communities’ commitment to quality rather than just the structure of the resulting code. Challenges exist in defining what constitutes a defect or bug, and the role of modularity in affecting FLOSS quality. The authors suggest three considerations for future research on FLOSS quality models: (1) defect resolution rate, (2) kind of software product, and (3) modularity—both technical and organizational.","https://www.igi-global.com/viewtitle.aspx?TitleId=74669",""

Besides a digital infrastructure, this framework also needs a legal infrastructure in order to ensure compliance with the Fab City principles. In this regard, the law presents two conflicting approaches: exclusivity through Intellectual Property Rights (IPRs) or sharing of information based on the credo of the open-source movement. Both of these approaches might be necessary to enable the Fab City concept to flourish. This article will address this seeming dichotomy. We will further examine the relevance of IPRs and their respective features to the Fab City framework and address licensing challenges that may emerge from their use.","https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/978-3-658-44114-2_10",""

Most of these training modules simplify the development environment, for example, by using LEGO bricks or playing cards. This oversimplification has been shown to result in limited transferability of learning to industrial practice. Furthermore, there is a lack of teaching modules that specifically address the challenges of applying Agile to physical products. In this paper, we present an open‐source educational game that realistically simulates a hardware development project to teach Agile principles. Over 2 days, participants design, manufacture, and test modifications for a physical wire bending machine within an authentic engineering and production setting. The training mimics the typical roles, processes, and tools of industrial engineering teams to reflect the challenges of Agile hardware development. The module was evaluated with 44 industry professionals regarding perceived learning and user reaction. A combination of quantitative and qualitative methods was used for the experimental evaluation. The results showed a positive learning effect as the participants' average agreement with Agile principles increased through the training. Concerning user reaction, respondents reported a high degree of relevance, interaction, and confidence, indicating that the realistic simulation of the hardware development appropriately balanced the degree of realism with simplicity. The study showcases the opportunities of properly aligning game components to provoke learning situations targeted by the instructors. It contributes to the extant literature by providing a design framework (product, process, setting, and instruction) and open‐source access to the tools used for implementation.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/cae.22616",""

Working in a federated environment where DPPs can be exported and authenticated even when they cross different contexts, we also examine how cryptography is used to ensure the integrity of DPPs by relying on authenticity rather than authorization.","https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/978-3-658-44114-2_8",""

On the other, maker projects and activities (Arduino tinkering, building 3D printers,  setting up a DIYbio lab infrastructure)  remain niche, exploratory and private, even when they are part of the informal, transnational networks (Vertesi et al. 2011; Kaiying & Lindtner 2016), which I call ""geek diplomacy"" (Kera 2015).  Without clearly stating any local or transnational agenda, the DIY makers productively and creatively negotiate the various dichotomies between individualism and collectivism, local and global interests, nationalism and cosmopolitanism. They connect politics and design through ""liminal,"" meaning individual and exploratory, experiences of prototyping and tinkering which differ greatly from the knowledge and skills acquisitions or prototyping common in the industrial or academic context. To explain this liminality in the maker culture, I extended Gabriella Coleman's (2012) pioneering work on the paradoxes of hacker (and open source software) movement. The decentralized and transnational networks of makers and hackers are examples of (technological) communitas and liminality (Turner 1969), which negotiate various conflicting goals and agenda behind making, technology and globalization.  The maker culture can serve isolationist and cosmopolitan agendas at the same time, even embrace the open source rhetoric while remaining partially patented, pirated and hybrid. It mobilizes the Global South hopes of low cost technologies while performing the Silicon Valley clichés and using migrant slave labor in China, but also African conflict minerals. Rather than empowering some idealized notion of the subject, community or even nation, it demarcates the limits and conditions of our understanding of governance and its relation to production, making, and design.Keywords: Maker Culture; Open Source Hardware; Politics and Design; Global South.","http://revista.ibict.br/liinc/article/viewFile/3875/3202",""

The underlying objective of the proposed scheme is to make the meter based on the “Do It Yourself” methodology which requires considerably fewer funds. Also, it is conceivable by keeping easy to understand interface, information legitimacy, precision of measured information and convenience for the conclusive client.

The use of novel open-source sensors, defined as hardware whose design is made publicly available, lowers the cost dramatically compared to commercial solutions and allows implementing higher spatiotemporal resolution sensor grids that are imperative for modeling and mechanistic understandings. Here, I will present the basic concepts, advantages, and challenges of using open-source, low-cost, do-it-yourself hardware for soil gas monitoring (mainly O2, CO2, CH4, and N2O), including examples in which this type of sensors was utilized to solve soil-related research questions. For example, the development of a low-cost wireless underground sensor network for O2/CO2 monitoring under waterlogged conditions using the relatively new low-power long-range (LoRa) communication protocol. Another example is a portable, low-cost incubation chamber for quantifying soil microbial activity using in-situ sensors for measuring O2, CO2, CH4, and air temperature at high temporal resolution (<1 min). In all the presented studies, only readily buyable hardware is used, and complete technical guides on design, assembly and installation are provided. By doing so, the adoption and cost barriers can be reduced, allowing easier reproducibility and opening the technology for new applications in soil gas monitoring studies.","",""

Hardware and software build instructions are provided to convert the donor vehicle into a low-cost and fully autonomous platform. The open platform consists of (a) hardware components: CAD designs, bill of materials, and build instructions; (b) Arduino, ROS and Gazebo control and simulation software files which provide standard ROS interfaces and simulation of the vehicle; and (c) higher-level ROS software implementations and configurations of standard robot autonomous planning and control, including the move_base interface with Timed-Elastic-Band planner which enacts commands to drive the vehicle from a current to a desired pose around obstacles. The vehicle is large enough to transport a human passenger or similar load at speeds up to 15 km/h, for example for use as a last-mile autonomous taxi service or to transport delivery containers similarly around a city center. It is small and safe enough to be parked in a standard research lab and be used for realistic human-vehicle interaction studies. System build cost from new components is around USD7,000 in total in 2022. OpenPodcar thus provides a good balance between real world utility, safety, cost and research convenience.","https://ojs.lib.uwo.ca/index.php/openhardware/article/download/17859/13492",""

We demonstrate that the MOF can be produced at atmospheric pressure, an improvement over previous reports, but also with a reduction in reaction time of 93%. This improvement in reaction time was predicted after a single experiment using the monitoring kit showing how efficiencies in the lab can be gained with very little experimental and monetary overhead while minimising the resources used.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-73780-z.pdf",""

The sensor, based on instantaneous measurements, functions as a position server for dual-axis solar trackers in photovoltaic plants. The proposed device has been developed with free software and hardware, which makes it a pioneering solution because it is open and accessible as well as capable of being improved by the scientific community, thereby contributing to the rapid advancement of technology. In addition, the device includes an algorithm developed ex professo that makes it possible to predetermine the regions of the celestial sphere for which, according to the geometric characteristics of the PV plant, there would be shading between the panels. In this way, solar trackers do not have to locate the Sun’s position at all times according to astronomical models, while taking into account factors such as shadows or cloudiness that also affect levels of incident irradiance on solar collectors. Therefore, with this device, it is possible to provide photovoltaic plants with dual-axis solar tracking with a low-cost device that helps to optimise the trajectory of the trackers and, consequently, their radiative capture and energy production.","https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/21/3/726/pdf",""

The combination of accessible hardware and high-performance deep learning (DL) tools for plant analysis is becoming widely recognised as a path forward for both plant science and applied precision agricultural purposes. Yet, a lack of collaboration in image analysis for plant science, despite the open-source origins of much of the technology, is hindering development. Here, we show how tools developed for specific attributes of phenotyping or weed recognition for precision weed control have substantial overlapping data structure, software/hardware requirements and outputs. An open-source approach to these tools facilitates interdisciplinary collaboration, avoiding unnecessary repetition and allowing research groups in both basic and applied sciences to capitalise on advancements and resolve respective bottlenecks. The approach mimics that of machine learning in its nascence. Three areas of collaboration are identified as critical for improving efficiency, (1) standardized, open-source, annotated dataset development with consistent metadata reporting; (2) establishment of accessible and reliable training and testing platforms for DL algorithms; and (3) sharing of all source code used in the research process. The complexity of imaging plants and cost of annotating image datasets means that collaboration from typically distinct fields will be necessary to capitalize on the benefits of DL for both applied and basic science purposes.","https://academic.oup.com/aobpla/advance-article-pdf/doi/10.1093/aobpla/plad010/49467881/plad010.pdf",""

Among the various techniques available, photoplethysmography stands out as particularly promising for assessing vital signs such as heart rate, respiratory rate, oxygen saturation, and blood pressure. Despite the efficacy of this method, many commercially available wearables, bearing Conformité Européenne marks and the approval of the Food and Drug Administration, are often integrated within proprietary, closed data ecosystems and are very expensive. In an effort to democratize access to affordable wearable devices, our research endeavored to develop an open-source photoplethysmographic sensor utilizing off-the-shelf hardware and open-source software components. The primary aim of this investigation was to ascertain whether the combination of off-the-shelf hardware components and open-source software yielded vital-sign measurements (specifically heart rate and respiratory rate) comparable to those obtained from more expensive, commercially endorsed medical devices. Conducted as a prospective, single-center study, the research involved the assessment of fifteen participants for three minutes in four distinct positions, supine, seated, standing, and walking in place. The sensor consisted of four PulseSensors measuring photoplethysmographic signals with green light in reflection mode. Subsequent signal processing utilized various open-source Python packages. The heart rate assessment involved the comparison of three distinct methodologies, while the respiratory rate analysis entailed the evaluation of fifteen different algorithmic combinations. For one-minute average heart rates’ determination, the Neurokit process pipeline achieved the best results in a seated position with a Spearman’s coefficient of 0.9 and a mean difference of 0.59 BPM. For the respiratory rate, the combined utilization of Neurokit and Charlton algorithms yielded the most favorable outcomes with a Spearman’s coefficient of 0.82 and a mean difference of 1.90 BrPM. This research found that off-the-shelf components are able to produce comparable results for heart and respiratory rates to those of commercial and approved medical wearables.","https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/24/12/3766/pdf",""

Direct geo-referencing system uses the technology of remote sensing to quickly grasp images, GPS tracks, and camera position. These data allows the construction of large volumes of images with geographic coordinates. So that users can be measured directly on the images. In order to properly calculate positioning, all the sensor signals must be synchronized. Traditional aerial photography use Position and Orientation System (POS) to integrate image, coordinates and camera position. However, it is very expensive. And users could not use the result immediately because the position information does not embed into image. To considerations of economy and efficiency, this study aims to develop a direct geo-referencing system based on open source software and hardware platform. After using Arduino microcontroller board to integrate the signals, we then can calculate positioning with open source software OpenCV. In the end, we use open source panorama browser, panini, and integrate all these to open source GIS software, Quantum GIS.

Usually this is achieved by SCADA systems. But SCADA systems are technically complex and expensive. They are often not affordable for small water utilities. Their systems are operated with a very low level of automatization and monitoring causing inefficient operation, water loss or even interruption of service. The Internet of Things concept is very promising to realize a cost-effective tool for monitoring and control of water systems. The potential of this approach is investigated in the research project IoT.H2O funded in the WaterJPI call IC4WATER. In the paper, the concept of the IoT system for monitoring and control of water supply systems is explained. Special gateways and IoT devices have been developed which communicate with the IoT platform by the LoRaWAN network protocol or WiFi. It is shown how a pump test rig can be controlled with these devices. Also, results of field installations in a water distribution system in Germany are presented. Moreover, it is shown how data from existing SCADA systems and results from network simulations with EPANET can be included in the IoT system and how the data can be processed and evaluated by the IoT platform. By combining the data of different systems, the developed IoT system provides the user a cost-effective tool for monitoring and control of a water system.","http://ocs.editorial.upv.es/index.php/WDSA-CCWI/WDSA-CCWI2022/paper/viewFile/14788/8437",""

Our aim is to help decision makers assess the benefits and challenges associated with creating or joining such ecosystems. We use a case study approach on six major collaborative ecosystems that enable the development of complex, high cost infrastructures and platforms. We characterize their strategy, governance, and their degree of intellectual property (IP) openness. We offer a three-dimensional framework that helps managers characterize such ecosystems. Although all the ecosystems studied aim at scaling up innovative solutions, their strategy, governance and IP openness vary. An upstream strategy aimed at replacing supplier proprietary design with open substitutes requires a democratic governance and an intellectual property policy that maximize the attractiveness of the ecosystem. A downstream strategy aimed at carving a space in new markets requires an autocratic governance and an intellectual property policy that combine attractiveness and value capture opportunities.","https://journalsojs3.fe.up.pt/index.php/jim/article/download/2183-0606_009-002_0003/536",""

LiDAR is usually deployed through manned or unmanned aerial vehicles. As typical payloads are high, an aircraft with LiDAR needs to be significant in size. Therefore, LiDAR is currently only done by specialized companies with expensive equipment, and cannot be deployed by local service providers in low income countries, despite the plethora of use cases for its data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A promising avenue to replace LiDAR is photogrammetry. It can be applied with much lighter and more affordable aircrafts and its use to provide extensive terrain datasets is steadily increasing. The scalable open-source software OpenDroneMap allows for extending datasets to very large amounts. Photogrammetry however, cannot penetrate vegetation, and (as is the case with LiDAR) does not resolve ground terrain in obscured areas such as dense urban areas with narrow alleys.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That is why we are developing OpenDroneMap360, a free and open-source DIY hardware-software camera-ball platform for collection of high quality photos with any carrier you can think of.

Historically, open source software’s clear economic advantages over proprietary software caused a gain in market share, despite previous bias towards proprietary software. To achieve its full potential both requires a level playing field and a sufficiently large user base. Governments have a clear role to play in the creation of a level playing field. The public sector meanwhile can choose to be pro-active in its support for open source software, or merely to be neutral so that there are, at least, no barriers to the procurement of open source, or, to demonstrate a bias towards particular proprietary solutions. Whatever the policy, there are both obligations and limits on what a public authority can do as part of the procurement process: for public procurement sits within a framework of international and local laws.","https://academic.oup.com/book/chapter-pdf/54406764/oso-9780198862345-chapter-21.pdf",""

Modern and legacy communication protocols are handled for seamless data exchange with a programmable logic controller and a programmable load. The development of the system is expounded, and experimental results are reported to prove the suitability and validity of the proposal. In particular, I-V curve tracing of a monocrystalline PV generator under real operating conditions is successfully conducted.","https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/21/22/7650/pdf",""

In the last years the functionality and type of UAV-systems increased fast, but unfortunately these systems are hardly available for researchers in some cases. A simple and low-cost solution was developed to build an autonomous aerial surveying airplane, which can fulfil the necessities (aerial photographs with very-high resolution) of other departments at the university and very useful and practical for teaching photogrammetry.. The base was a commercial, remote controlled model airplane and an open-source GPS/IMU system (MatrixPilot) was adapted to achieve the semi-automatic or automatic stabilization and navigation of the model airplane along predefined trajectory. The firmware is completely open-source and easily available on the website of the project. The first used camera system was a low-budget, low-quality video camera, which could provide only 1.2 megapixel photographs or low resolution video depending on the light conditions and the desired spatial resolution. A field measurement test was carried out with the described system: the aerial surveying of an undiscovered archaeological site, signed by a crop-mark in mountain Pilis (Hungary).","https://isprs-archives.copernicus.org/articles/XXXVIII-1-C22/155/2011/isprsarchives-XXXVIII-1-C22-155-2011.pdf",""

One of the most fundamental questions relating to these phenomena is why developers contribute their private resources to these public goods. While this question has been discussed, theorized, and empirically investigated in the context of OSS, there has been no research so far in the context of OSH. Can we really assume the motivations behind the development of the OSH to be the same as those behind OSS? Based on the self‐determination theory (SDT), we provide original insights into the motivations behind contributions to OSH development. We collected data from the most common and active 3D printing communities, which are the main loci of OSH development. We thus have a unique cross‐sectional data set with participants from over 30 different countries using all kinds of different OSH platforms. Our analysis reveals several important findings: firstly, the motivations are in some aspects very similar to those in open source software notwithstanding different possibilities, hurdles, and incentives regarding the OSS and OSH. Above all, enjoyment‐based intrinsic motivation is a major factor affecting contribution levels. Secondly, among internalized extrinsic motivations, expected private benefits through improving own skills stands out. Thirdly, different factors of internalized extrinsic motivations can have different moderating effects on the effect of enjoyment‐based intrinsic motivation. Given the imminent changes in business models throughout manufacturing industries in order to adapt to the challenge that OSH will increasingly pose, our findings have important implications not only for OSH communities and 3D development platforms, but also for businesses that want and probably soon have to engage in open innovation.","https://api.wiley.com/onlinelibrary/tdm/v1/articles/10.1111%2Fradm.12348",""

In this paper, we investigate KM practices and needs in Open Source Hardware (OSH) communities. The aim is to provide insights into the KM issues and challenges facing these communities. Our analysis is based on interviews carried out with the participants of 22 projects. Interview transcriptions were coded and tagged with concepts extracted from the literature. Text mining was used to uncover the main concepts embedded in the corpus. From this analysis, knowledge sharing emerged as one of the top-rated concepts. Codification and personalization also proved to be important KM approaches, both requiring support in the OSH design process. Using a dendrogram, we highlighted the benefits and challenges of codification together with some interesting concept associations. High contributor turnover, little or no standardization and weak project structuring are still key challenges for OSH communities when it comes to ensuring awareness, making decisions and sharing knowledge.","https://www.cambridge.org/core/services/aop-cambridge-core/content/view/S2053470120000189",""

However, open source (hardware) design implies a tremendous change in both design practices and philosophy because it is partly related to the movements of creative commons and the sharing economy. From this perspective one could think that participation is crucial in the success of open source design projects. In this paper, we analyse 9 case studies in the light of 3 hypotheses. If many studies highlight the potential of the crowd as a resource for design tasks, our study shows that for open source design communities the participation is not massive. In this study, we used an activity-based approach to build our model. As open source design processes are fairly unstructured and based on voluntary participation, it is impossible to adopt a classical task-based model. With the help of this model, we were able evaluate the overall size of the active community, the participation rate with regards to the activities. This study paves the way to deeper and extensive studies on how to support communities engaged in open source design of hardware products.","https://www.cambridge.org/core/services/aop-cambridge-core/content/view/S2220434219002373",""

These partnerships generally use a proprietary standard research agreement (PSRA), which for historical reasons contains significant IP monopoly language and restrictions for both the company and the university. Such standard research agreements thus create an artificial barrier to innovation as both companies using a libre model and universities they wish to collaborate with must invest significantly to restructure the contracts. To solve this problem, this article provides a new Sponsored Libre Research Agreement (SLRA). The differences between the agreements are detailed. The advantages of using an SLRA are provided for any type of company and include: (1) minimizing research investments on reporting requirements; (2) reducing delays related to confidentiality and publication embargos; and (3) reducing both transaction and legal costs as well as research time losses associated with IP. Moving to libre agreements both speeds up and reduces costs for setting up collaborative research. Under the SLRA, university researchers can spend more time innovating for the same investment.","https://www.mdpi.com/2411-5134/3/3/44/pdf",""

The greatest added value an open hardware repository brings to the user-developer community is validation and vetting of the designs. A business model was proposed that uses revenue from the vetting process to fund validation studies and sustainable operations of the open hardware repository itself. As the return on investment of laterally-scaled open hardware that can leverage distributed manufacturing has the potential for creating enormous value, maintaining repositories for this hardware enables vast wealth generation for everyone.

GOSH is here described embedded in the context of the wider open hardware movement and analyzed in terms of framings that inform it, spaces opened up for action and strategies developed to open them.

In these narratives, citizen participation in design and intellectual property management based on open source principles are the promise of more sustainable production models. In this context, openness in product design and development has been the object of growing interest and experimentation from academia, businesses and grassroots communities. As a result, numerous concepts emerged that attempt to grasp the essence of this phenomenon, unfortunately leading to overlapping, conflicting or speculative depictions. In this article, we share the understanding we gained throughout 6 years of research on Open Design and Open Source Hardware and attempt to make the difference between myths and facts. We depict an enthusiastic but realistic picture of Open Design and Open Source Hardware practices as we could observe them and deliver a structured framework to situate concepts and their differences. From this, we share seven observations leading to seven corresponding research questions and establish a research agenda to stimulate further investigations into this socially relevant and potentially ground-breaking phenomenon.","https://www.cambridge.org/core/services/aop-cambridge-core/content/view/S2053470121000147",""

These principles support the development of products in transparent processes allowing the participation of any interested person. While increasing numbers of products have been released as OSH, little is known on the prevalence of participative development practices in this emerging field. It remains unclear to which extent the transparent and participatory processes known from software reached hardware product development. To fill this gap, this paper applies repository mining techniques to investigate the transparency and workload distribution of 105 OSH product development projects. The results highlight a certain heterogeneity of practices filling a continuum between public and private development settings. They reveal different organizational patterns with different levels of centralization and distribution. Nonetheless, they clearly indicate the expansion of the open source development model from software into the realms of physical products and provide the first large-scale empirical evidence of this recent evolution. Therewith, this article gives body to an emerging phenomenon and contributes to give it a place in the scientific debate. It delivers categories to delineate practices, techniques to investigate them in further detail as well as a large dataset of exemplary OSH projects. The discussion of first results signposts avenues for a stream of research aiming at understanding stakeholder interactions at work in new product innovation practices in order to enable institutions and industry in providing appropriate responses.","https://www.cambridge.org/core/services/aop-cambridge-core/content/view/S205347011800015X",""

This has been found to be 10 times less cost than the general‐purpose computing equipment available on the market, with a substantial reduction in shockwave data processing time and effort. The setup has been tested with the different diaphragms producing shockwaves of different Mach numbers. The experimental results are compared with the theoretical values obtained using normal shock relations and are found to be consistent with admissible error limits. This validates the design and construction of the device for scientific experiments.","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/eng2.12353",""

The advantage of this method is its cost-effectiveness and ability to construct a microscope system using commercially available optical components and open-source software.

Methods:: By definition, open source hardware is “hardware whose design is made publicly available so that anyone can study, modify, distribute, make, and sell the design or hardware based on that design”. Arduino microcontroller boards and the evolution in 3d printing technologies are among the most successful open hardware examples. These examples showed that both collaboration and competition are factors facilitating and accelerating innovations. They also help universalizing research by decreasing costs and enabling higher‐level manufacturing. Participation in open source projects in academia has also shown to have multiple advantages. The project gets massively peer reviewed through its online publication, and the comments generally lead to improvement of the design and better performance. It also increases the visibility of the work, therefore increasing the chance for citations and funding. Results:: The development in‐house of a motorized detector positioning device that can be mounted to a water tank will be open‐sourced and presented as an example of open source project that could be useful to others in the Medical Physics field, whether it is for research or clinical work. The common aspects to share when open‐sourcing a project will be discussed. A device for regulating the temperature inside a water phantom will also be presented and open‐sourced to the community. Finally, the development of a project‐sharing web platform specially designed for the Medical Physics community will be discussed. Conclusion:: The open source hardware movement is gaining in popularity and the Medical Physics field could benefit from a similar collaborative open‐framework. It would definitely help driving and accelerating innovations in the field as well as decreasing some of the associated costs.","https://api.wiley.com/onlinelibrary/tdm/v1/articles/10.1118%2F1.4923957",""

To date, there is no strategic and actionable framework using the commons theory for analyzing how these hardware initiatives develop economically effective and sustainable business models. Based on an analysis of the business models of 27 community-based and community-oriented OSH initiatives studied over a 3-year period, this chapter presents such a framework. The five-stages spiral framework offers to guide companies and startups involved in OSH to interact with their surrounding innovation ecosystems progressively, enrich their value propositions and grow in impact.","https://www.igi-global.com/viewtitle.aspx?TitleId=326639",""

However, a common belief is that the greater economic cost and complexity of hybrid digital objects (i.e., digital objects with both hardware and software) precludes their development with open source methods traditionally used for software. We study a sophisticated OSH named White Rabbit initiated at CERN and developed through a vibrant and heterogenous open source community. Our findings show that the assumption that hardware and software require fundamentally distinctive development and production modes should be replaced with a more nuanced differentiation characterized by three main attributes describing an object’s composition: embodiment, modularity, and granularity. Taken together, these three attributes determine how a hybrid object is developed throughout its evolution in an open source community. Our research offers several contributions. First, we provide a more nuanced view of the consequences of the material embodiment of hardware. Once considered a simple deterrent to open source development, we describe how economic cost is subordinate to more influential aspects of an object’s physical layers: as the open source community modifies the object to accommodate the operating requirements of diverse physical instantiations, such modifications can be incorporated in the logical design covered by the open source license. Additionally, we show how embodiment, modularity, and granularity progress through the object’s evolution and how this maturation subsequently affects development modes. We trace the implications of our findings for hybrids and digital object conceptualizations in IS research, open source development and, more broadly, normative implications for OSH in scientific and commercial computing.","",""

Die rechtlichen Fragen, die sich in diesem Zusammenhang stellen, sind durchaus komplex und neuartig. Das liegt zum einen an der Natur der Wertschöpfungskette von OSH, bei der auf verschiedenen Stufen (Designentwurf, Herstellung, Verbreitung) unterschiedliche Personen(gruppen) beteiligt sind. Zum anderen wird OSH häufig aus altruistischen Zwecken und von Laien entworfen, hergestellt und verbreitet, für die ein einheitlicher Sorgfaltsmaßstab nur schwer zu bilden ist. In diesem Beitrag wird überblicksartig auf die potenzielle Haftung der Designer eines OSH-Bauplanes eingegangen. Dabei werden einige der wichtigsten rechtlichen Fragestellungen identifiziert und Perspektiven für die weitere Forschung aufgezeigt.","https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/978-3-658-44114-2_11",""

Drawing from ethnographic and archival research of collaborative and competitive dynamics around “Open Hardware” at CERN, I examine how “open” scientific tools and infrastructures are designed, disputed, and implemented following Free and Open Source development models. In questioning “openness” both at the level of technical objects and their technical collectives, I examine the usage of Open Hardware for validating and assessing research results as well as rendering scientific projects more permeable to new modes of participation in the making of the“technoscience by other means.” --- Paper submitted for the ""Colloque annuel de l’IFRIS 2018,"" Université Paris VI, France.</p>","",""

Hardware security tokens effectively prevent most password-related security issues and improve security indisputably. However, we would like to highlight that there are new threats from attackers with physical access which need to be discussed. Supply chain adversaries may manipulate devices on a large scale and install backdoors before they even reach end users. In evil maid scenarios, specific devices may even be attacked while already in use. Hence, we thoroughly investigate the security and trustworthiness of seven commercially available open source security tokens, including devices from the two market leaders: SoloKeys and Nitrokey. Unfortunately, we identify and practically verify significant vulnerabilities in all seven examined tokens. Some of them are based on severe, previously undiscovered, vulnerabilities of two major microcontrollers which are used at a large scale in various products. Our findings clearly emphasize the significant threat from supply chain and evil maid scenarios since the attacks are practical and only require moderate attacker efforts. Fortunately, we are able to describe software-based countermeasures as effective improvements to retrofit the examined devices. To improve the security and trustworthiness of future security tokens, we also derive important general design recommendations.","https://tches.iacr.org/index.php/TCHES/article/download/8972/8550",""

A steadily growing number of companies develop open-source hardware (OSH) products based on the existing body of free technological knowledge today, with many of them manufactured in their own vicinity which in turn improves resource productivity and social benefits. Fab labs/makerspaces as openly accessible facilities with local communities of makers have the potential to act as catalysts to mature and disseminate OSH development collaboratively. In the Horizon 2020 project OPENNEXT, 17 case studies were implemented in four clusters where makerspaces worked together with small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) for a limited time to provide new pathways for OSH co-creation and sharing. Various consumer goods industries, such as electronics, furniture, and mobility amongst others, were in focus. Different roles within the development process emerged from this SME-makerspace-cooperation for OSH that will need to be upscaled and elaborated by makerspaces.","https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/978-3-658-44114-2_17",""

Here, the use of open source software in blockchain requires an understanding of blockchain technology and the broader category of ‘Distributed Ledger Technology’ (‘DLT’). Furthermore, blockchain is divided into three layers: protocol layer, network layer, and data layer. This chapter focuses on the protocol layer software such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, EOS, and Cordera. However, the software stack for blockchain systems which build on top of these protocol layers is very complex and varies based on the blockchain system. The protocol layers, such as Bitcoin and Ethereum, are sometimes referred to as ‘Layer 1’ or the ‘base layer’. Some blockchain systems also have ‘Layer 2’ software such as the ‘Lightening Network’ for Bitcoin. Blockchain systems also host application software, with smart contacts, tokens, and ‘DApps’, all of which are software.","https://academic.oup.com/book/chapter-pdf/54406766/oso-9780198862345-chapter-22.pdf",""

However, the complexity of state-of-the-art microscopes has increased considerably, often requiring the precise control and synchronization of multiple peripheral devices at high speeds. Drawing inspiration from open-source prototyping systems, like the Arduino, we describe the development of a new control platform that adopts the best features of these systems – affordability, facile programmability, and flexible connectivity – but with the scientific-grade inputs and outputs (I/O) and built-in routines that are necessary to control peripherals in advanced microscopy applications. Notably, our platform includes waveform generators and I/O for point-and azimuthal-scanning of excitation in laser-based applications. As a proof of concept, we show how the integration of waveform generation, multiplexed analog outputs, and native hardware triggers into a single central hub provides a versatile platform for performing fast circle-scanning acquisitions, including ring scanning-angle interference microscopy (SAIM), total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF and ring TIRF) microscopy, and multiangle TIRF (MA-TIRF). We also demonstrate how the low communication latency of our hardware platform can reduce image intensity and reconstruction artifacts arising from synchronization errors produced by software control. Our complete platform, including hardware design files, firmware, API, software, and all associated source code, will be hosted for community-based development and collaboration.","https://syndication.highwire.org/content/doi/10.1101/533349",""

Smart converters are simple or interleaved converters. They are equipped with controllers that are able to online impedance match for the maximum power transfer. These conversion systems are particularly feasible for photovoltaic and all renewable energies systems working in continuous changing operating conditions. Smart converters represent promising solutions in recent energetic scenarios, in fact their application is deepening and widening. In this context, the availability of a hardware platform could represent a useful tool. The platform was conceived and released as an open hardware instrument for academy and industry to benefit from the improvements brought by the researchers’ community. The usage of a novel, open-source platform would allow many developers to design smart converters, focusing on algorithms instead of electronics, which could result in a better overall development ecosystem and rapid growth in the number of smart converter applications. The platform itself is proposed as a benchmark in the development and testing of different maximum power point tracking algorithms. The designed system is capable of accurate code implementations, allowing the testing of different current and voltage-controlled algorithms for different renewable energies systems. The circuit features a bi-directional radio frequency communication channel that enables real-time reading of measurements and parameters, and remote modification of both algorithm types and settings. The proposed system was developed and successfully tested in laboratory with a solar module simulator and with real photovoltaic generators. Experimental results indicate state-of-art performances as a converter, while enhanced smart features pave the way to system-level management, real-time diagnostics, and on-the-flight parameters change. Furthermore, the deployment feasibility allows different combinations and arrangements of several energy sources, converters (both single and multi-converters), and modulation strategies. To our knowledge, this project remains the only open-source hardware smart converter platform used for educational, research, and industrial purposes so far.","https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9292/8/3/367/pdf",""

These are communities formed around a set of related projects with common governance, which often produce artifacts shared among all projects. It helps to think of a portfolio of project communities as an ecology, in which the projects are mutually dependent, and there is both cross-project collaboration and competition for resources among the communities. As a case study, we explore the ecology of communities within the Apache project, one of the largest and most visible open source projects. We infer the community structure from developer mailing lists, and study how the communities evolve and interact over time. The analysis lends support to the often-stated hypothesis that open source communities grow by a process of preferential attachment. However, we show that the influx of external developers is not the only factor affecting community growth. The structure and dynamics of a community is also impacted by inter-project information flow, and the migration of developers between projects (including the formation of spin-offs).","https://www.igi-global.com/viewtitle.aspx?TitleId=10082",""

The first method is based on classical PC plus A/D and D/A converters and the second one is based on a microcontroller (Atmel ARM7). Both methods can be used for verification of algorithms for control and identification of processes, modeling of transport processes dynamics using simulation experiments, if simulations run in real time. The application of a microcontroller allows a simple realization of changing parameters and also non-linearity of the process. In the paper we also pay attention to the realization of real time in a programmable environment under Microsoft Windows and the realization of precise calculations in floating point on microcontrollers.","http://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.2478/s13537-012-0025-5.pdf",""

FOSS is unique in that it is at the same time state of the art technology, a commodity, and a public good. FOSS communities are social groups of individual and organisational contributors that participate voluntarily in the production of public information goods. Furthermore, communities are able to resolve issues without the coordination provided by a central authority like the state. This shapes how FOSS collaboration relates to market competition and the value propositions of businesses. Today collaboration spans both unpaid or volunteer participation and industry contributions that are made in the course of employment or under the guidance of a commercial sponsor. This chapter develops a basic taxonomy based on a combination of the revenue model, the type of good, and the differentiating aspects of FOSS-based products.","https://academic.oup.com/book/chapter-pdf/54406746/oso-9780198862345-chapter-15.pdf",""

Seaweed presents a promising option but requires investigation into the viability of unconventionally sourced ropes for harvesting. In this regard, a low-cost reliable method to test the tensile strength of rope is needed to validate alternative materials for use in harvesting seaweed. Commercial rope testing jigs alone range in price from several thousand to tens of thousands of dollars, so there is interest in developing a lower-cost alternative. Addressing these needs, this article reports on an open-source design for tensile strength rope testing hardware. The hardware design focuses on using readily available parts that can be both sourced from a hardware store and manufactured with simple tools to provide the greatest geographic accessibility. The jig design, which can be fabricated for CAD 20, is two to three orders of magnitude less expensive than commercially available solutions. The jig was built and tested using a case study example investigating denim materials (of 1 5/8”, 3 1/4”, 4 7/8”, 6 1/2”, and 8 1/8” widths) as a potential alternative rope material for seaweed farming. Denim demonstrated strengths of up to 1.65 kN for the widest sample, and the jig demonstrated sufficient strength and stiffness for operations at forces below 4 kN. The results are discussed and areas for future improvements are outlined to adapt the device to other circumstances and increase the strength of materials that can be tested.","https://www.mdpi.com/2813-6640/2/1/2/pdf",""

The design is extensible for research and monitoring purposes, and all design files are provided under open-source permissive licenses for further development. System design and operation are discussed for illustrative purposes. A block diagram indicates elements of mechanical, electrical, and software design for this system. The mechanical assembly used to house circuit boards and sensors is designed using 3D printing for rapid prototyping. The electronic circuit board acts as a carrier for an Arduino 32-bit microcontroller board and an associated cellular module along with a GPS for geolocation of water quality measurements. The cellular module permits data transfer for Internet of Things (IoT) functionality. System operation is set up using a command line interface (CLI) and C++ code that allows for calibration coefficients and human readable transfer functions to be defined so that sensor voltages are related to physical quantities. Data are cached on a secure digital (SD) card for backup. The circuit was calibrated, and system operation assessed by deployment on an urban reservoir. Biogeochemical cycles were identified in the collected data using spectrogram and semivariogram analyses to validate system operation. As a system with hardware and software released under an open source license, the WaterWatcher platform reduces the time and effort required to build and deploy low-cost water quality measurement sensors and provides an example of the basic hardware design that can be used for measurements of water quality.","https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-449278/v1",""

Due to the severity of these attacks, manufacturers deploy hardware-based fault defenses into security-critical systems, such as secure elements. The development of these countermeasures is a challenging task due to the complex interplay of circuit components and because contemporary design automation tools tend to optimize inserted structures away, thereby defeating their purpose. Hence, it is critical that such countermeasures are rigorously verified post-synthesis. Since classical functional verification techniques fall short of assessing the effectiveness of countermeasures (due to the circuit being analyzed when no faults are present), developers have to resort to methods capable of injecting faults in a simulation testbench or into a physical chip sample. However, developing test sequences to inject faults in simulation is an error-prone task and performing fault attacks on a chip requires specialized equipment and is incredibly time-consuming. Moreover, identifying the fault-vulnerable circuit is hard in both approaches, and fixing potential design flaws post-silicon is usually infeasible since that would require another tape-out. To that end, this paper introduces SYNFI, a formal pre-silicon fault verification framework that operates on synthesized netlists. SYNFI can be used to analyze the general effect of faults on the input-output relationship in a circuit and its fault countermeasures, and thus enables hardware designers to assess and verify the effectiveness of embedded countermeasures in a systematic and semi-automatic way. The framework automatically extracts sensitive parts of the circuit, induces faults into the extracted subcircuit, and analyzes the faults’ effects using formal methods. To demonstrate that SYNFI is capable of handling unmodified, industry-grade netlists synthesized with commercial and open tools, we analyze OpenTitan, the first opensource secure element. In our analysis, we identified critical security weaknesses in the unprotected AES block, developed targeted countermeasures, reassessed their security, and contributed these countermeasures back to the OpenTitan project. For other fault-hardened IP, such as the life cycle controller, we used SYNFI to confirm that existing countermeasures provide adequate protection.","https://tches.iacr.org/index.php/TCHES/article/download/9813/9318",""

Zum Thema Open Source Hardware, einem Teilbereich der Open Innovation, liegt dennoch nur wenig wissenschaftlich fundiertes Material vor. Grundlegende Charakteristika, wie z.B. Community-Beteiligung und Aufgabe von geistigem Eigentum, können bereits als technologischer und gesellschaftlicher Rahmen des Phänomens identifiziert werden. Durch den massiven Zugriff auf externe Problemlösungskompetenz und die verminderte Kapitalbindung im Produktionsbereich können Open Source Hardware-Unternehmen heute branchenspezifische Vorteile nutzen, die den traditionellen Fertigungsbetrieben vorenthalten bleiben. Dieser Beitrag wird die bedeutendsten Charakteristika systematisch aufarbeiten und, auf Basis der Ergebnisse einer qualitativen Unternehmensbefragung, die entstehenden Möglichkeiten für das Unternehmensmanagement und die Gestaltung moderner Produktionssysteme darstellen.","https://www.degruyter.com/document/doi/10.3139/104.110561/xml",""

From computing devices, scientific instrumentation, and biological reagents, to remote sensing satellites, researchers rely on hardware to explore and understand the world. However, research equipment is typically based on closed source (i.e. proprietary) hardware, whose designs are legally restricted, preventing others from studying, building, or modifying them. These restrictions cause several problems such as: lack of reproducibility; duplication of effort; forced obsolescence; and higher costs. Crucially, the inefficiencies of closed source hardware reinforce global inequities. This is because the design and manufacturing of research equipment is often monopolised by producers in the Global North. Restricted access to hardware designs mean that only authorised dealers and technicians are allowed to sell or maintain equipment. These services are often unavailable to, or prohibitively expensive for, researchers belonging to historically marginalised communities outside of the Global North. Building on the success of open source software, open source hardware is defined as any physical artefact whose “design is made publicly available with explicit, legally binding freedoms for anyone to study, modify, distribute, make, and sell the design or hardware based on that design”. Open science hardware is an emerging field of practice which studies and applies the principles of open source hardware to research contexts. In 2021, it was formally recognised as a key component in the UNESCO Recommendation on Open Science. Open science hardware provides many benefits compared to its proprietary counterparts. This can include cost savings of up to 87% (Pearce, 2020) and proportional to how often it is replicated; quicker iteration of designs; and adaptation to local needs in underserved communities. Since the 2010s, open science hardware has been developed and used in diverse domains from environmental monitoring, and lab automation, to microscopy. In addition to academics, open science hardware is commonly built by citizen science communities and adapted for different purposes. Other practitioners of open science hardware include educators, social innovators, or artists. In this talk, we provide an overview of open science hardware and the problems it solves. We also provide successful examples of open science hardware projects that serve to not only do good science, but also address global inequities. The talk also presents the Gathering for Open Science Hardware, an international network working towards the adoption of open source hardware across research lifecycle.  ","http://journals.ed.ac.uk/eor/article/download/8112/11875",""

This trend has increased attention to open source hardware (OSH): a phenomenon that extends the intellectual property management and development practices in open source software (OSS) into the design of physical objects. OSH projects are different from OSS projects due to product type, and distinct from traditional closed source new product development (NPD) ones due to their openness. These differences challenge the degree of applicability of existing project success definitions in the OSH context. To investigate project success in OSH, we conducted a qualitative survey with practitioners. We report characteristics of successful OSH projects through three identified themes: (a) value creation – the big-picture impact, (b) quality of output – the quality of the hardware and accompanying documentation and (c) project process – activities that contribute to success. We contextualise by comparing OSH with selected literature on the success of OSS and NPD project management. While our study confirms a similarity between OSS and OSH in defining project success, it also highlights themes that are uniquely important to the latter. These findings are helpful for OSH development practice and could provide lessons for OSS development and closed source NPD.","https://www.cambridge.org/core/services/aop-cambridge-core/content/view/S2053470121000305",""

Openly sharing designs of technical products is a step towards democratising access to new technologies for the benefit of individuals and communities in society. At the core of the open-source hardware definition lies the freedom for anyone to replicate the hardware based on the design. Thus, enabling this freedom is a step towards developing a successful OSH. Previous research supposes that a bill of materials and assembly instructions are enough for this. In this study, we question this assumption and investigate what other factors may influence replicability of an OSH. Using data from a survey and interviews with OSH practitioners, we identify and describe these factors, which relate to the documentation, the design and the context of the person replicating the hardware. Using these insights, we present a diagram of the replication process along with questions the person replicating the hardware would ask to check whether an OSH is replicable. Finally, we synthesise this information into practical advice for OSH projects to increase the replicability of the designs they produce, and thus the likelihood of their project's success.","https://www.cambridge.org/core/services/aop-cambridge-core/content/view/S2732527X21004430",""

With the advent of technology, expansion of telephone network, and lowering of tariff, there has been expansion of e-learning services, web based education, and mobile learning. Currently there are around 600 conventional (face-to-face) universities in India serving around 1.2 billion students. Starting with one Open University in 1982, now we have 15 open universities. There are single mode and dual mode distance education institutions. These provide instructions from print based to technology enabled means. All these developments transformed the teaching learning. Many of the institutions followed Open Educational Resources and Open Source movement. Reasons are varied for adopting open source. With the purpose to reduce the costs on software development, freedom to improve the software and freedom to redistribute to help neighbours has made individuals, institutions, and governments support open source.

Medical devices play an important role in managing acute and chronic respiratory failure, including diagnosis, monitoring, and providing artificial ventilation. Current commercially available respiratory devices are very effective but, given their cost, are unaffordable for most patients in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). Herein, we focus on a relatively new design option—the open-source hardware approach—that, if implemented, will contribute to providing low-cost respiratory medical devices for many patients in LMICs, particularly those without full medical insurance coverage. Open source reflects a set of approaches to conceive and distribute the comprehensive technical information required for building devices. The open-source approach enables free and unrestricted use of the know-how to replicate and manufacture the device or modify its design for improvements or adaptation to different clinical settings or personalized treatments. We describe recent examples of open-source devices for diagnosis/monitoring (measuring inspiratory/expiratory pressures or flow and volume in mechanical ventilators) and for therapy (non-invasive ventilators for adults and continuous positive airway pressure support for infants) that enable building simple, low-cost (hence, affordable), and high-performance solutions for patients in LMICs. Finally, we argue that the common practice of approving clinical trials by the local hospital ethics board can be expanded to ensure patient safety by reviewing, inspecting, and approving open hardware for medical application to maximize the innovation and deployment rate of medical technologies.","https://www.mdpi.com/2075-4426/12/9/1498/pdf",""

When operating as a scanning acoustic microscope, the specimen will be water-coupled to a high-frequency ultrasound transducer operating in pulse-echo mode. When operating as a photoacoustic microscope, short light pulses infrared laser diode located under the specimen will generate ultrasound pulses thermoelastically, which will then be received by a confocal high-frequency transducer. In both cases, the specimen will be raster-scanned under the transducer by a moving stage. The mechanical scanning system was designed and built using a spring-loaded microscope stage, micrometers, stepper motors, a shield board used for 3D printers, an Arduino Mega microcontroller, and a Raspberry Pi 4 microcomputer.

The question is whether these solutions measure up to built-for-purpose devices. In the paper, we provide a comparison of existing built-for-purpose devices against open source devices. For comparison, we have also designed and rapidly prototyped a sensor node based on off-the-shelf components. We show that these devices compare favorably to built-for-purpose devices in terms of performance, power and cost. Using open platforms and off-the-shelf components would allow more developers to build intelligent devices and sensor networks, which could result in a better overall development ecosystem, lower barriers to entry and rapid growth in the number of IoT applications.","https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/15/3/6818/pdf",""

As nations increasingly rely on knowledge assets to grow, the adoption of OSS will have profound economic consequences. This paper identifies the mechanisms inherent to OSS production that help fuel innovation in knowledge-based economies. As a collaborative and open production model, OSS is conceptualized as a prototype of open innovation. Drawing on US employment projections for 2008-2018, the authors' analysis predicts OSS will have a positive impact on employment growth in well-paid salary jobs across multiple sectors of the US economy. OSS-related software development jobs are widely diffuse throughout the economy, help build a skilled labour force and offer wages significantly above the national average. OSS is thus believed to be a strong contributor to growth in high-value employment in the US. The authors also posit that, as industries are exposed to the benefits of OSS as a result of the broad diffusion of OSS-related jobs, open innovation processes outside software development may be adopted through a process of learning and imitation.","https://www.igi-global.com/viewtitle.aspx?TitleId=120934",""

The drive towards smart cities has produced the need for smart sensors to be able to monitor what is happening in our cities. This, combined with the decrease in hardware component prices and the increase in the popularity of open hardware, has favored the deployment of sensor networks based on open hardware. The new trends in Internet Protocol (IP) communication between sensor nodes allow sensor access via the Internet, turning them into smart objects (Internet of Things and Web of Things). Currently, WSNs provide data in different formats. There is a lack of communication protocol standardization, which turns into interoperability issues when connecting different sensor networks or even when connecting different sensor nodes within the same network. This work presents a sensorized platform proposal that adheres to the principles of the Internet of Things and theWeb of Things. Wireless sensor nodes were built using open hardware solutions, and communications rely on the HTTP/IP Internet protocols. The Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) SensorThings API candidate standard was used as a neutral format to avoid interoperability issues. An environmental WSN developed following the proposed architecture was built as a proof of concept. Details on how to build each node and a study regarding energy concerns are presented.","https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/15/3/5555/pdf",""

In part due to these cost savings, the manufacturing of scientific equipment is beginning to move away from a central paradigm of purchasing proprietary equipment to one in which scientists themselves download open-source designs, fabricate components with digital manufacturing technology, and then assemble the equipment themselves. This trend introduces a need for new formal design procedures that designers can follow when targeting this scientific audience. This study provides five steps in the procedure, encompassing six design principles for the development of free and open-source hardware for scientific applications. A case study is provided for an open-source slide dryer that can be easily fabricated for under $20, which is more than 300 times less than some commercial alternatives. The bespoke design is parametric and easily adjusted for many applications. By designing using open-source principles and the proposed procedures, the outcome will be customizable, under control of the researcher, less expensive than commercial options, more maintainable, and will have many applications that benefit the user since the design documentation is open and freely accessible.","https://www.mdpi.com/2411-9660/2/1/2/pdf",""

Recent medical research also indicates a gentle ventilation may be more appropriate for many patients. This article details the design of an open source gentle ventilator (gentle-vent) framework that can be used in periods of scarcity when no other options are available. The system utilizes a wide range of commonly available components that are combined using basic electronics skills to achieve the desired end product. The firmware is programed in the Arduino IDE using any Arduino compatible microcontroller. The main function of the gentle-vent is to generate a calibrated pressure wave at the pump to provide support to the patient’s breathing. Each gentle-vent permutation was tested using a DIY manometer as it could be done in the field in low-resource settings. These measurements were also verified with an open source VentMon. All permutations were able to accurately hold a desired setpoint for at least 2 hours. The most rudimentary implementation using found mechanical components and perf-board costs less than $20. The results indicate that an open source approach can be used to make breathing support accessible in most contexts.</p>","",""

The review was conducted by classifying previous studies into three types of Arduino applications: field monitoring systems, wearable systems, and autonomous systems. With regard to field monitoring systems, most studies in mines were classified as atmospheric or geotechnical monitoring. In wearable systems, the health status of the miner was an important consideration, in addition to the environmental conditions of the mine. Arduino can be a useful tool as an initial prototype for autonomous mine systems. Arduino has advantages in that it can be combined with various electronic products and is cost-effective. Therefore, although many studies have been conducted in the laboratory (as opposed to field tests), Arduino applications can be further expanded in the mining field in the future.","https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3417/10/14/5018/pdf",""

The author demonstrates that the concentration of code in the VideoLAN project —already pointed out in other projects—does not only depend on technical expertise but is strongly influenced by the nature of social relationships among developers. Face-to-face relationships have a great importance, as does friendship which can favor the circulation of advice. In addition to technical expertise, a second kind of expertise —the ability to be aware of who is working on what—determines the hierarchy within this entity that looks like a collegial organization. The author hopes that this work will help to reduce the hiatus between technical and social considerations on open source software.","https://www.igi-global.com/viewtitle.aspx?TitleId=18723",""

One method for mechanical stimulation of hollow organs, including colon and bladder, are controlled distensions mediated by compressed air. For example, distension of the bladder can be used as an assay for bladder nociception. Bladder distension causes a corresponding increase in abdominal electromyography, which increases with distension pressure and is attenuated with analgesics. However, the hardware used to control these distensions are primarily all one-off custom builds, without clear directions how to build your own. This has made it difficult for these methods to be fully utilized and replicated as not everyone has access, knowledge and resources required to build this controller. Here we show an open-source Arduino based system for controlling a solenoid valve to deliver timed pressure distensions in the experimental model. This device can be controlled by one of two methods through direct TTL pulses from the experimenters data acquisition software (ex. CED Spike2) or by a graphical user interface, where the user can set the time before, during, and after distension as well as the number of cycles. This systems low cost and relative ease to build will allow more groups to utilize timed pressure distensions in their experiments.","https://syndication.highwire.org/content/doi/10.1101/2021.03.15.435466",""

Design/methodology/approach: This argument is based on three pillars. The first one refers to a bibliographic review of theoretical frameworks related to academic entrepreneurship and technological innovation to emphasize the disruptive innovation capacity of academia. Second, a few elements related to the Brazilian political, economic and structural scenario, which entail a (more) favorable environment to technological innovation and academic entrepreneurship, is presented. Finally, concepts related to OSH and its business model are approached to demonstrate the facilitating effect toward the whole process. Findings: As a result of the argument made herein, it is possible to perceive the viability of the OSH model in terms of entrepreneurship and technological innovation in the academic sphere, and to perceive its benefits before social and economic needs in areas such as health and education. Research limitations/implications: There are no empirical or quantifiable data in the literature that enable comparison between OSH and traditional technological innovation models. Originality/value: The considerations on the philosophical value of OSH and its business models are scarcely explored in international literature. As far as we know, relating OSH to technological innovation entrepreneurship in the academic sphere, as well as its singularities in Brazil regarding the innovation national system and social and economic demands, is a unique approach in literature.","https://www.emerald.com/insight/content/doi/10.1108/INMR-06-2018-0036/full/html",""

By interviewing 37 open source hardware company leaders, 12 company community members as well as analyzing forum data of 3 open source hardware companies; we realize that by open sourcing the design of hardware, a company can naturally establish its community, which is a key element for a company's success. Establishing a community can increase customer perceived value, decrease product development and sales cost, shorten product go-to-market time, and incubate startups with knowledge, experience and resources. These advantages can compensate for the risks associated with open source strategies and can make open source design a viable product development strategy for hardware startups.","https://www.cambridge.org/core/services/aop-cambridge-core/content/view/S2220434219002300",""

The research community is therefore curious about the viability of open source projects in other areas. In around 2000, open source practices started to take place in the commercial hardware realm, and so far, the phenomenon has not been fully explored. Using grounded theory, the authors studied 31 firms for an average of 2.3 years, discovering a 4-phase growth pattern of open source hardware firms, including starting the firm, identifying core competencies, business model improvement and business maturation. The firms behaviors in each stage are reported, as well as the evolution of community demography, behaviors and impact in different growth phases.","http://asmedigitalcollection.asme.org/IDETC-CIE/proceedings-pdf/doi/10.1115/DETC2019-97618/6453990/v007t06a027-detc2019-97618.pdf",""

Open source models for tangible products are still in its infancy, and many studies are required to demonstrate its application to for-profit product development. It is an alluring question why entrepreneurs decide to use an open model to develop their products under risks and unknowns, such as infringement and community management. The goal of this paper is to investigate the motivations of entrepreneurs of open source hardware companies. The leaders and founders of twenty-three companies were interviewed to understand their motivation and experiences in creating a company based on open source hardware. Based on these interviews, we generated a hierarchical framework to explain these motivations, where each level of the framework has been defined, explained and illustrated with representative quotes. The motivations of open source action are framed by two categories in the paper: 1) Intrinsic Motivation, which describes the motivations of an entrepreneur as an individual, who needs personal satisfaction, enjoyment as well as altruism and reciprocity; 2) Extrinsic Motivation, which describes motivations of an entrepreneur whose identity is as a for-profit company leader.","http://asmedigitalcollection.asme.org/IDETC-CIE/proceedings-pdf/doi/10.1115/DETC2017-68195/2473239/v001t02a059-detc2017-68195.pdf",""

In doing so, it has started to change not only how physical products are designed and developed, but also the commercialisation process. In recent years, authors have witnessed entrepreneurs intentionally choosing not to patent their product design and technologies but instead licencing the designs and technologies under open-source licences. The entrepreneurs share their product designs online with their community – people who congregated due to the shared interests in products’ technology or project’s social objectives. Founding a startup firm without excluding others from using their own invention is not a common practice. Therefore, there is reason to ask if this choice a strategic decision or irrational action due to short-sightedness or extreme altruism? Conducting interviews with 65 founders, we grounded a framework explaining that the driver of going open is a result of both intrinsic and extrinsic factors. In addition, we observed the change of identities over time among the entrepreneurs. We hope to use this paper as a pilot study of this emerging socio-technological phenomenon, which is understudied relative to the proprietary product commercialisation process.","https://www.cambridge.org/core/services/aop-cambridge-core/content/view/S2053470121000159",""

Though many research efforts explored whether the same level of co-creation efforts could take place broadly in the hardware realm, very few research studies focus on profit-seeking hardware projects initiated by companies. In fact, the specific nature of being tangible and profitable makes company-led open source hardware projects suspicious to be really “open” to contributors. Community has been identified as the critical driver in many open projects. By reviewing the evolution of company-community interactions over time and different community behaviors in different open development context, authors in this paper hope to identify best community- company interaction forms for open source hardware companies. Using grounded theory and case studies, we construct a framework to describe and identify company community's different behaviors and different roles.","https://www.cambridge.org/core/services/aop-cambridge-core/content/view/S2220434219002464",""

Οι συσκευές ανοιχτού κώδικα και υλικού χρησιμοποιούνται σε μεγάλο αριθμό εφαρμογών σε τομείς υγείας, εκπαίδευσης, γεωπονίας, αθλημάτων, βιολογίας, έρευνας και άλλων. Η παρούσα διατριβή εστιάζει στους τομείς της γεωπονίας και έρευνας. Το Κεφάλαιο 1 παρουσιάζει μία σύντομη εισαγωγή για τους παράγοντες που έχουν συνεισφέρει στην διάδοση των συσκευών ανοιχτού κώδικα και υλικού. Επιπλέον παραθέτει ορισμούς για τον ανοιχτό κώδικα και το υλικό όπως και την περιγραφή των εφαρμογών τους στη γεωργία ακριβείας, έξυπνη γεωργία και έρευνα. Ακόμα επισημαίνει τη φιλοσοφία του ανοιχτού κώδικα και υλικού όπως και την ελεύθερη διάδοση της γνώσης για κάθε άνθρωπο που επιθυμεί να αντιγράψει, τροποποιήσει ή δημιουργήσει συσκευές της συγκεκριμένης φιλοσοφίας ενώ ταυτόχρονα μοιράζεται τη διαδικασία και όλα τα υλικά και μεθόδους που χρησιμοποίησε. Παρουσιάζονται παραδείγματα δημοσιεύσεων που αφορούν τη συγκεκριμένη φιλοσοφία όπως και τα πλεονεκτήματα χρήσης τους ενώ αναγνωρίζεται η ανάγκη ανάπτυξης πλαισίου για την αξιολόγηση των λειτουργιών και της αξιοπιστίας των μετρήσεων των συγκεκριμένων συσκευών. Συγκεκριμένα, ορίζεται η έννοια των ερευνών συμφωνίας και ομοιότητας και η συνεισφορά τους στην αξιολόγηση και στον θετικό ή αρνητικό προσδιορισμό της χρήσης των δύο συσκευών εναλλακτικά χωρίς να επηρεάζει κάποιο αποτέλεσμα. Το Κεφάλαιο 2 περιγράφει τις μεθοδολογίες που χρησιμοποιήθηκαν για την αξιολόγηση της συμφωνίας και ομοιότητας μεταξύ συσκευών ανοιχτού κώδικα και των αντίστοιχων εμπορικών. Συγκεκριμένα, παρέχει μία εκτεταμένη συζήτηση για τη χρήση διαφορετικών μοντέλων ανάλογα με τα δεδομένα που παράγονται από συσκευές υπό διερεύνηση και την αξιολόγηση δεικτών και γραφημάτων που ερμηνεύονται εύκολα ακόμα και από άτομα χωρίς ιδιαίτερη εμπειρία στη στατιστική. Επιπλέον, σε περίπτωση που το συμπέρασμα της έρευνας καταλήγει σε μη αποδεκτή συμφωνία, πιθανές πηγές ασυμφωνίας μπορούν να εντοπιστούν και μέθοδοι διόρθωσης της συμφωνίας μπορούν να εφαρμοστούν. Ακόμα, αναφέρονται τα πλεονεκτήματα και μειονεκτήματα κάθε προσέγγισης για την αξιολόγηση της συμφωνίας και ομοιότητας. Περαιτέρω παρουσιάζεται ο πειραματικός σχεδιασμός και η στατιστική ανάλυση που ακολουθείται ανάλογα με τη φύση της έρευνας καθώς και τα βήματα για τον έγκυρο σχεδιασμό της. Επιπλέον παρουσιάζονται λανθασμένες ή ελλείπεις μέθοδοι αξιολόγηση της συμφωνίας και ομοιότητας μεταξύ δύο συσκευών. Τέλος, αναφέρονται συνοπτικά οι μεθοδολογίες όπως το υλικό και το λογισμικό που χρησιμοποιήθηκε για το σχεδιασμό των συσκευών για την ολοκλήρωση της διατριβής. Στο Κεφάλαιο 3 παρουσιάζεται ο σχεδιασμός και η ανάπτυξη ενός ασύρματου μετεωρολογικού σταθμού ανοιχτού κώδικα και υλικού που μετρά τη θερμοκρασία και υγρασία του περιβάλλοντος. Αρχικά, αξιολογείται η λειτουργία του σταθμού παρακολουθώντας τις μετρήσεις μέσω ασύρματης τεχνολογίας Wi-Fi για επτά μέρες. Έπειτα, σχεδιάζεται πείραμα αξιολόγησης συμφωνίας και ομοιότητας του σταθμού με αντίστοιχο εμπορικό με αισθητήρα Thygro και τα αντίστοιχα περιφερειακά από την εταιρεία Symmetron. Αναφέρεται ο πειραματικός σχεδιασμός καθώς και η χρήση μοντέλων μεικτών επιδράσεων μαζί με τη συνεισφορά τους στη σύγκριση των δύο συσκευών. Για το πείραμα κατασκευάστηκαν τριάντα συσκευές ανοιχτού κώδικα και υλικού και χρησιμοποιήθηκαν τρείς αντίστοιχοι εμπορικοί σταθμοί. Για τον λόγο αυτό δημιουργήθηκαν τρείς ομάδες. Κάθε ομάδα περιέχει 10 σταθμούς ανοιχτού κώδικα και υλικού και μία εμπορική. Κάθε πειραματική μονάδα παράγει ένα σύμπλεγμα μετρήσεων σε συνάρτηση του χρόνου. Το πείραμα τερματίστηκε μετά από επτά μέρες συνεχόμενων μετρήσεων. Καθώς οι μετρήσεις ανά πειραματική μονάδα ήταν πάνω από 220 για κάποιες μέρες (αφού υπήρχαν απώλειες δεδομένων λόγω κακής σύνδεσης στο διαδίκτυο) οι μετρήσεις συγχωνεύτηκαν σε χρονικές ζώνες, με τη μέθοδο που χρησιμοποιεί το Εθνικό Αστεροσκοπείο Αθήνας. Μόνο δύο από τις τρείς μεθοδολογίες συμφωνίας και ομοιότητας υλοποιήθηκαν με επιτυχία και εκτιμήθηκε ένας δείκτης συμφωνίας. Η συμφωνία μεταξύ των συσκευών θεωρήθηκε ανεπαρκής και ως πιθανή πηγή ασυμφωνίας θεωρήθηκε η ακρίβεια των αισθητήρων. Περεταίρω έρευνα μπορεί να υλοποιηθεί για να συμπεριληφθούν όλα τα σημεία των μετρήσεων όπως και επιπλέον παράγοντες που πιθανόν να επηρεάζουν τη συμφωνία, όπως η υγρασία του αέρα ή η τοποθεσία κάθε σταθμού. Τέλος, εναλλακτικές μορφές ασύρματης επικοινωνίας όπως η LoRa μπορούν να προστεθούν στο σταθμό όπως και επιπλέον αισθητήρες. Τα πλεονεκτήματα χρήσης της νέας συσκευής στηρίζονται στο χαμηλό κόστος παραγωγής του όπως και στην εύκολη μορφοποίηση και προσθήκη επιπλέον αισθητήρων. Στο Κεφάλαιο 4 παρουσιάζεται ο σχεδιασμός και η κατασκευή ενός ασύρματου καταγραφέα LoRa ανοιχτού κώδικα και υλικού για τη χρήση σε πειράματα ενυδρειοπονίας σε σάκους υποστρώματος περλίτη. Συγκεκριμένα, η νέα συσκευή είναι συμβατή με αισθητήρες περιεκτικότητας νερού, με πρωτόκολλο επικοινωνίας RS-485. Επιπλέον, ο αισθητήρας που χρησιμοποιήθηκε για το συγκεκριμένο πείραμα μετρά τη θερμοκρασία του σάκου υποστρώματος, την ηλεκτρική αγωγιμότητα καθώς και το pH. Μετά τον έλεγχο καλής λειτουργίας του καταγραφέα, σχεδιάστηκε το πείραμα αξιολόγησης συμφωνίας και ομοιότητας της νέας συσκευής με αντίστοιχη εμπορική. Συγκεκριμένα η εμπορική συσκευή που χρησιμοποιήθηκε για το πείραμα είναι η Handheld Meter (HH150) and SM150 Soil Moisture Sensor. Το μέγεθος δείγματος ήταν 100 σάκοι υποστρώματος περλίτη. Επιπλέον, για την ανάλυση χρησιμοποιήθηκε μοντέλο μέτρησης-σφαλμάτων για την εκτίμηση της διαφοράς στις μετρήσεις σε σχέση με τον καλύτερο γραμμικό αμερόληπτο παράγοντα πρόβλεψης της πραγματικής τιμής της μέτρησης που παράχθηκαν από την εμπορική συσκευή. Τα αποτελέσματα ανέφεραν σημαντική απόκλιση από την εκτίμηση της πραγματικής τιμής των μετρήσεων παραθέτοντας το σταθερό και αναλογικό σφάλμα. Η συμφωνία των δύο οργάνων θεωρήθηκε ικανοποιητική για συγκεκριμένα διαστήματα μετρήσεων. Τα πλεονεκτήματα χρήσης της νέας συσκευής συγκριτικά με της εμπορικής είναι το χαμηλό κόστος παραγωγής και η ευκολία μορφοποίησης της ανάλογα με τις ανάγκες των πειραμάτων. Ο σάκος υποστρώματος περλίτη έχει αρκετή παραλλακτικότητα ως προς την περιεκτικότητα του σε νερό. Επομένως η χρήση πολλαπλών αισθητήρων σε διαφορετικά σημεία του σάκου είναι θεμελιώδης και αποτελεί βασική απαίτηση ως εισροή πληροφορίας σε αλγόριθμους πρόβλεψης περιεκτικότητας νερού στο σάκο. Στο Κεφάλαιο 5 παρουσιάζεται ο σχεδιασμός και η κατασκευή καταγραφέα ανοιχτού κώδικα και υλικού που μετρά pH διαλυμάτων για τη χρήση σε πειράματα Δενδροκομίας. Για τη βαθμονόμηση της συσκευής χρησιμοποιήθηκαν ρυθμιστικά διαλύματα pH τιμών 4,01 και 7,01. Έπειτα αξιολογήθηκε η καλή λειτουργία της συσκευής μετρώντας το pH καρπών εσπεριδοειδών. Στη συσκευή προστέθηκε αδιάβροχος αισθητήρας θερμοκρασίας για την εξισορρόπηση της τιμής pH. Επιπλέον, σχεδιάστηκε μελέτη αξιολόγησης της συμφωνίας και ομοιότητας της νέας συσκευής με αντίστοιχη εμπορική. Συγκεκριμένα, η εμπορική συσκευή που επιλέχθηκε είναι η Hanna HI9024 Waterproof pHMeter. Για την ανάλυση χρησιμοποιήθηκαν μοντέλα μεικτών επιδράσεων και παράχθηκαν δείκτες και χρήσιμα γραφήματα υλοποιώντας παραπάνω από μία μεθοδολογίες. Έπειτα, αναφέρθηκαν τα πλεονεκτήματα και τα μειονεκτήματα κάθε μεθοδολογίας. Τα αποτελέσματα έδειξαν μη αποδεκτή συμφωνία μεταξύ των δύο οργάνων. Η ανάλυση ομοιότητας ανέφερε σταθερή απόκλιση -0.2215 μονάδων pH. Μετά τη χρήση μεθόδων αναβαθμονόμησης η συμφωνία θεωρείται άριστη. Η συσκευή είναι φορητή και μπορεί να χρησιμοποιηθεί για “επι τόπου” μετρήσεις στον αγρό ή στο θερμοκήπιο. Τα πλεονεκτήματα χρήσης της συσκευής είναι το χαμηλό κόστος παραγωγής, περίπου 4 φορές μικρότερο συγκριτικά με τη Hanna HI9024. Περαιτέρω έρευνα μπορεί να υλοποιηθεί για τη χρήση της συσκευής για τη μέτρηση pH εδάφους ή θρεπτικών υποστρωμάτων. Τέλος, επιπλέον αισθητήρες μπορούν να τοποθετηθούν εύκολα στη συσκευή για την ταυτόχρονη άντληση περισσότερων πληροφοριών για τα χαρακτηριστικά του δείγματος. Στο Κεφάλαιο 6 περιγράφεται η κατασκευή συσκευής ανοιχτού κώδικα και υλικού για τις ανάγκες πειραμάτων που αφορούν τη μύγα της Μεσογείου (Ceratitis Capitata). Η συσκευή καταγράφει τη θερμοκρασία στην επιφάνεια και τον πυρήνα καρπών όπως και την εξωτερική θερμοκρασία. Επιπλέον, αξιολογήθηκε η λειτουργία της στο εργαστήριο αλλά και στον αγρό. Για τα πειράματα στον αγρό η συσκευή τοποθετήθηκε σε συγκεκριμένα σημεία σε ποικιλία δέντρων. Το σχήμα αλλά και το μέγεθος της συσκευής καθιστά ιδανική την τοποθέτηση του σε οποιοδήποτε σημείο του δέντρου επιθυμεί ο ερευνητής. Η συσκευή είναι φορητή και λειτουργεί με μπαταρία. Η αυτονομία της μπορεί να φτάσει στις 7 έως 30 μέρες ανάλογα με το χρονικό διάστημα καταγραφής. Έπειτα σχεδιάστηκε μελέτη συμφωνίας και ομοιότητας για τη σύγκριση της θερμοκρασίας του πυρήνα και της επιφάνειας του καρπού καθώς ο στόχος του πειράματος ήταν η ποσοτικοποίηση της απόκλισης των θερμοκρασιών των δύο σημείων σε διαφορετικές συνθήκες. Για την ανάλυση χρησιμοποιήθηκαν μοντέλα μέτρησης-σφαλμάτων. Τα αποτελέσματα αναφέρουν σταθερή απόκλιση 0,331℃ καθώς και αναλογική απόκλιση 0,982. Επιπλέον, η σύγκριση ακρίβειας των μετρήσεων στα δύο σημεία υποδηλώνει ότι ο πυρήνας διατηρεί τη θερμοκρασία περισσότερο συγκριτικά με την επιφάνεια σε διαφορετικές συνθήκες. Τέλος, σε μελλοντικές μελέτες, ασύρματη τεχνολογία LoRa μπορεί να προστεθεί στη συσκευή, ηλιακοί συλλέκτες για περισσότερη αυτονομία καθώς και ρολόι ακριβείας για την καλύτερη λειτουργία των κύκλων αδρανοποίησης της συσκευής. Με τις συγκεκριμένες τροποποιήσεις η συσκευή μπορεί να λειτουργεί για μήνες λόγω των λειτουργιών χαμηλής κατανάλωσης. Το κεφάλαιο επτά αποτελεί μία γενική συζήτηση για τα προηγούμενα κεφάλαια καθώς και τα ευρήματα κάθε μελέτης. Τέλος αναφέρονται μελλοντικές έρευνες για την τροποποίηση των συσκευών καθώς και για τη βελτίωση των μεθόδων συμφωνίας και ομοιότητας.Το κεφάλαιο οκτώ συμπεριλαμβάνει τα συμπεράσματα αλλά και τη συνεισφορά και καινοτομία της διατριβής.","",""

CubeSats as a sub-class of nanosatellites have become a game-changer in the industry of scientific research and exploration of the new space technologies. Their cost effectiveness, relative ease of manufacturing, and the predicted lifecycle are the main factors of success. Having such popularity in mind – many vendors, student teams and enthusiast started to build their platforms to offer reuse and faster buildup of such satellites, introducing so-called COTS/MOTS approach of the satellite’s construction. However, looking into statistics – only 2.5% of the launched satellites were able to full perform their mission, and almost 25% just failed. Partially, the key problems are in the area of using non-radiation hardened electronics as the CubeSat idea is to use commercial (or at utmost automotive) components. Authors of the article provide a holistic view on the existing hardware and software platforms that are currently available as COTS/MOTS solutions, as well as their capabilities. Part of the research was done in the area of the available software frameworks, as the modern software has rather high cyclomatic complexity and often it is exactly software components that make CubeSat mission at risk. Software related frameworks are compared via the use of newly introduced by the authors multi-factor ranking model (FMCSA). At the same time the article raises the cross-country problem of the creation and use of the Ukrainian platform for the CubeSats. Authors propose a solution for the creation of the part of the CubeSat platform as the starting point and it is an On-Board Computer (OBC). The idea is to design an OBC that can solve the big portion of the known issues of the CubeSat hardware and software with the major stress on the hardware issues related to the Single-Event Upset (SEU) and Single-Event Latch Up (SEL), without moving to the radiation tolerant semiconductors. Proposed in the article solution combines the selection of the modern central processor, that is industry recognized, availability of the software solutions for it, as well as the power-domains control principle that allows to minimize the potential harm of the SEU and SEL radiation-driven events.","http://rocketspace.dp.ua/index.php/rst/article/download/185/153",""
