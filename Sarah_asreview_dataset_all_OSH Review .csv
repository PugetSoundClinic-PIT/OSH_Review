The rapid pace of progress in robotics is in part fueled by open source projects, providing researchers with resources, tools, and devices to implement novel ideas and approaches quickly. Open source hardware, in particular, lowers the barrier of entry to new technologies and can further accelerate innovation in robotics. But open hardware is also more difficult to propagate in comparison to open software because it involves replicating physical components, which requires users to have sufficient familiarity and access to fabrication equipment. In this work, we present a review on open robot hardware (ORH) by first highlighting the key benefits and challenges encountered by users and developers of ORH, and then relaying some best practices that can be adopted in developing successful ORH. To accomplish this, we surveyed more than 80 major ORH projects and initiatives across different domains within robotics. Finally, we identify strategies exemplified by the surveyed projects to further detail the development process, and guide developers through the design, documentation, and dissemination stages of an ORH project.","[Patel, Vatsal V.; Dollar, Aaron M.] Yale Univ, Dept Mech Engn & Mat Sci, New Haven, CT 06520 USA; [Liarokapis, Minas V.] Univ Auckland, Dept Mech & Mechatron Engn, New Dexter Res Grp, Auckland 1010, New Zealand",Yale University; University of Auckland,"Patel, VV (corresponding author), Yale Univ, Dept Mech Engn & Mat Sci, New Haven, CT 06520 USA.",v.patel@yale.edu; minas.liarokapis@auckland.ac.nz; aaron.dollar@yale.edu,"Liarokapis, Minas/E-1990-2015","Liarokapis, Minas/0000-0002-6016-1477; Patel, Vatsal/0000-0002-6564-5622","U.S. National Science Foundation [1734190, 1928448]; Directorate For Engineering; Div Of Civil, Mechanical, & Manufact Inn [1928448] Funding Source: National Science Foundation; Div Of Information & Intelligent Systems; Direct For Computer & Info Scie & Enginr [1734190] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","U.S. National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Directorate For Engineering; Div Of Civil, Mechanical, & Manufact Inn(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Engineering (ENG)); Div Of Information & Intelligent Systems; Direct For Computer & Info Scie & Enginr(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Computer & Information Science & Engineering (CISE))",This work was supported by the U.S. National Science Foundation under grants 1734190 and 1928448.,,157,3,3,2,5,IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC,PISCATAWAY,"445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA",1070-9932,1558-223X,,IEEE ROBOT AUTOM MAG,IEEE Robot.

This trend has increased attention to open source hardware (OSH): a phenomenon that extends the intellectual property management and development practices in open source software (OSS) into the design of physical objects. OSH projects are different from OSS projects due to product type, and distinct from traditional closed source new product development (NPD) ones due to their openness. These differences challenge the degree of applicability of existing project success definitions in the OSH context. To investigate project success in OSH, we conducted a qualitative survey with practitioners. We report characteristics of successful OSH projects through three identified themes: (a) value creation - the big-picture impact, (b) quality of output - the quality of the hardware and accompanying documentation and (c) project process - activities that contribute to success. We contextualise by comparing OSH with selected literature on the success of OSS and NPD project management. While our study confirms a similarity between OSS and OSH in defining project success, it also highlights themes that are uniquely important to the latter. These findings are helpful for OSH development practice and could provide lessons for OSS development and closed source NPD.","[Antoniou, Rafaella; Bonvoisin, Jeremy; Hsing, Pen-Yuan; Dekoninck, Elies] Univ Bath, Dept Mech Engn, Bath, Avon, England; [Defazio, Daniela] Univ Bath, Sch Management, Bath, Avon, England",University of Bath; University of Bath,"Antoniou, R (corresponding author), Univ Bath, Dept Mech Engn, Bath, Avon, England.",r.antoniou@bath.ac.uk,"Hsing, Pen-Yuan/JGM-4181-2023; Defazio, Daniela/A-5363-2009","Hsing, Pen-Yuan/0000-0002-5394-879X; Antoniou, Rafaella/0000-0002-3027-0381; Bonvoisin, Jeremy/0000-0003-4146-1607; Defazio, Daniela/0000-0002-8185-4045",European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme [869984]; A.G.

One of the most fundamental questions relating to these phenomena is why developers contribute their private resources to these public goods. While this question has been discussed, theorized, and empirically investigated in the context of OSS, there has been no research so far in the context of OSH. Can we really assume the motivations behind the development of the OSH to be the same as those behind OSS? Based on the self-determination theory (SDT), we provide original insights into the motivations behind contributions to OSH development. We collected data from the most common and active 3D printing communities, which are the main loci of OSH development. We thus have a unique cross-sectional data set with participants from over 30 different countries using all kinds of different OSH platforms. Our analysis reveals several important findings: firstly, the motivations are in some aspects very similar to those in open source software notwithstanding different possibilities, hurdles, and incentives regarding the OSS and OSH. Above all, enjoyment-based intrinsic motivation is a major factor affecting contribution levels. Secondly, among internalized extrinsic motivations, expected private benefits through improving own skills stands out. Thirdly, different factors of internalized extrinsic motivations can have different moderating effects on the effect of enjoyment-based intrinsic motivation. Given the imminent changes in business models throughout manufacturing industries in order to adapt to the challenge that OSH will increasingly pose, our findings have important implications not only for OSH communities and 3D development platforms, but also for businesses that want and probably soon have to engage in open innovation.","[Hausberg, J.

Several researchers worked on how to characterize OSH. Bonvoisin and Mies (Procedia CIRP 78:388-393, 2018) defined the ""open-o-meter"", i.e. a series of criteria to measure the openness of an OSH project. These criteria fall into two categories: product openness and process openness. The open-o-meter gives clear guidelines on measuring product openness by verifying access to specific types of documents, however the criteria to measure process openness are relatively implicit. In this paper, we propose to measure an OSH project's process openness by identifying different types of collaboration tools in that project. We will evaluate 226 OSH projects' process openness by analysing their usage of collaboration tools, for example social media, wiki, GitHub etc. This empirical study showed that the usage of collaboration tools in OSH projects decreases as the score of open-o-meter decreases, which implies that the open-o-meter measures correctly an OSH project's process openness. This research not only validates open-o-meter, but also offers an explicit way to measure an OSH project's process openness that might be very useful for companies to evaluate potential collaborations.","[Dai, X.; Boujut, J.

While some expect such open-source hardware (OSH) to lead to transformational changes in the ways technologies are produced, the available empirical evidence suggests that, to date, the diffusion of most OSH applications has been modest. In this paper, we focus on the limited uptake of OSH and study factors that help explain its adoption by users who replicate available open-source designs. Given our limited understanding of this topic, we present an in-depth study of small wind turbines based on open designs. Through a systematic review of the case-specific literature, we identify and analyse 60 documents, including case studies, construction manuals, market analyses, and technical assessments. We find that the adoption of available open-source wind turbine designs by technology users depends on a number of factors that are currently underemphasized in discussions on the potential of OSH. This includes the quality of OSH self-manufactured products, the particular motivations of adopters to engage with OSH, the availability of adequate production inputs for local manufacturing, and the resources available through open-source communities.","[Reinauer, Tobias; Hansen, Ulrich Elmer] Tech Univ Denmark, Dept Technol Management & Econ, UNEP DTU Partnership, Lyngby, Denmark",Technical University of Denmark,"Reinauer, T (corresponding author), Marmorvej 51, DK-2100 Copenhagen, Denmark.",tobre@dtu.dk,,"Reinauer, Tobias/0000-0002-0803-0250; Hansen, Ulrich Elmer/0000-0002-8997-6717",European Union [713683],European Union(European Union (EU)),This project has received funding from the European Union's Horizon 2020 Research and Innovation Programme under Marie SkodowskaCurie grant agreement No. 713683.,,125,7,7,6,25,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0166-4972,1879-2383,,TECHNOVATION,Technovation,AUG,2021,106,,,,,,,,102289,10.1016/j.technovation.2021.102289,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.technovation.2021.102289,,May 2021,12,"Engineering, Industrial; Management; Operations Research & Management Science",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Engineering; Business & Economics; Operations Research & Management Science,TK4HG,,,,,2024-08-15,WOS:000674120800002,0,,1,5

As predictions showed that the number of patients would exceed current supply of hospital-grade ventilators, a number of formal (academia, the industry and governments) and informal (fablabs and startups) entities raced to develop cheap, easy-to-fabricate mechanical ventilators. The presence of actors with very diverse modus operandi as well as the speed at which the field has grown, led to a fragmented design space characterized by a lack of clear design patterns, projects not meeting the minimum functional requirements or showing little-to-no innovation; but also valid alternatives to hospital-grade devices. In this paper we provide a taxonomic system to help researchers with no background in biomedical engineering to read, understand and contribute to the OSH-MV field. The taxonomy is composed of ten properties that are read through the lenses of three reflection criteria: buildability, adoptability and scalability. We applied the taxonomy to the analysis of seventeen OSH-MV projects, which are representative of the current landscape of possibilities available for COVID-19 patients. We discuss the different design choices adopted by each project highlighting strengths and weaknesses and we suggest possible directions for the development of the OSH-MV field.

However, three decades ago, the medical community started to consider repurposing ultrasound scanners to improve physical examinations. A broad community of healthcare professionals trained in the new clinical examination paradigm could not be created due to the very high price of portable ultrasound scanners available on the market. In this paper, we study an Open-Source Hardware (OSH) community that aims to improve diagnosis in hospitals and medically underserved areas worldwide. They are designing an echo-stethoscope - a portable ultrasound scanner - that would be affordable in low and middle-income countries. The variety of expertise pooled to achieve this objective puts this knowledge common (KC) at the crossroads of open-source software (OSS), OSH, and medical communities. Unlike typical KC outcomes, an ultrasound probe is a physical object. Development and innovation in the physical world bring social dilemmas that the community has to overcome, restrictions in terms of openness, and in this case, unintended privatization. Our study uses the governing knowledge common framework (GKCF), a modified institutional analysis and development framework, to untangle the interactions between resources, participants, and governance structures. Our research describes why and how the creation of a physical object subject to industry regulation influences the evolution and governance of the KC. We provide evidence that temporary privatization of the KC can be used as a way to protect and sustain a common during the industrialization phase. We also demonstrate how a portfolio of projects is an effective and resilient way to help the common survive this privatization step.","[Carpentier, Pascal] Erasmus Univ, Rotterdam Sch Management, Rotterdam, Netherlands; [Carpentier, Pascal] Drugs Neglected Dis Initiat, Geneva, Switzerland",Erasmus University Rotterdam - Excl Erasmus MC; Erasmus University Rotterdam,"Carpentier, P (corresponding author), Erasmus Univ, Rotterdam Sch Management, Rotterdam, Netherlands.; Carpentier, P (corresponding author), Drugs Neglected Dis Initiat, Geneva, Switzerland.",pcarpentier@dndi.org,,"Carpentier, Pascal/0000-0002-1483-0377",Drugs for Neglected Diseases initiative (DNDi),Drugs for Neglected Diseases initiative (DNDi),"The Drugs for Neglected Diseases initiative (DNDi) is grateful to its donors, public and private, who have provided funding to DNDi since its inception in 2003.

In this paper, extensive fieldwork was conducted to investigate a case of an open construction system, namely, the WikiHouse Den Bosch. The research framework builds on a combined view of two main concepts: conviviality and openness. The aim is to provide an in-depth understanding of the relationship between these two aspects and the literature regarding Design Global Manufacture Local. The analysis showed that conviviality and openness are complex and context-specific factors. The paper concludes by outlining the need for an institutionalized conviviality to open up new pathways for future practice to address sustainability issues.","[Priavolou, Christina] Tallinn Univ Technol, Ragnar Nurkse Dept Innovat & Governance, Akadeemia St 3, EE-12618 Tallinn, Estonia; [Niaros, Vasilis] Univ Oberta Catalunya, Internet Interdisciplinary Inst IN3, Av Carl Friedrich Gauss 5, Barcelona 08860, Spain",Tallinn University of Technology; UOC Universitat Oberta de Catalunya,"Niaros, V (corresponding author), Univ Oberta Catalunya, Internet Interdisciplinary Inst IN3, Av Carl Friedrich Gauss 5, Barcelona 08860, Spain.",vniaros@uoc.edu,"Priavolou, Christina/AAC-1159-2020","Priavolou, Christina/0000-0002-6987-641X; Niaros, Vasilis/0000-0002-2705-3589",European Research Council (ERC) under the European Union [802512]; COST Action [CA16121]; European Research Council (ERC) [802512] Funding Source: European Research Council (ERC),European Research Council (ERC) under the European Union(European Research Council (ERC)); COST Action(European Cooperation in Science and Technology (COST)); European Research Council (ERC)(European Research Council (ERC)),"This paper is part of a project that has received funding from the European Research Council (ERC) under the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme (grant agreement No 802512).

In doing so, it has started to change not only how physical products are designed and developed, but also the commercialisation process. In recent years, authors have witnessed entrepreneurs intentionally choosing not to patent their product design and technologies but instead licencing the designs and technologies under open-source licences. The entrepreneurs share their product designs online with their community - people who congregated due to the shared interests in products' technology or project's social objectives. Founding a startup firm without excluding others from using their own invention is not a common practice. Therefore, there is reason to ask if this choice a strategic decision or irrational action due to short-sightedness or extreme altruism? Conducting interviews with 65 founders, we grounded a framework explaining that the driver of going open is a result of both intrinsic and extrinsic factors. In addition, we observed the change of identities over time among the entrepreneurs. We hope to use this paper as a pilot study of this emerging socio-technological phenomenon, which is understudied relative to the proprietary product commercialisation process.","[Li, Zhuoxuan; Eesley, Charles] Stanford Univ, Dept Management Sci & Engn, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Seering, Warren; Yang, Maria] MIT, Dept Mech Engn, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA",Stanford University; Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT),"Li, ZX (corresponding author), Stanford Univ, Dept Management Sci & Engn, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",zxli@standford.edu,"Eesley, Charles/N-7888-2016","Eesley, Charles/0000-0003-2348-1583",,,,,64,2,2,2,12,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",2053-4701,,,DES SCI,DES.

The developments of open-source hardware (OSH) and the contribution towards the creation of hardware-based accelerators with implication mainly in machine learning (ML), has also been significant. In particular, the reduced instruction-set computer-five (RISC-V) open standard architecture has been widely adopted by a community of researchers and commercial users, worldwide, in numerous openly available implementations. The selection through a plethora of RISC-V processor cores and the mix of architectures and configurations combined with the proliferation of ML software frameworks for ML workloads, is not trivial. In order to facilitate this process, this paper presents a survey focused on the assessment of the ecosystem that entails RISC-V based hardware for creating a classification of system-on-chip (SoC) and CPU cores, along with an inclusive arrangement of the latest released frameworks that have supported open hardware integration for ML applications. Moreover, part of this work is devoted to the challenges that are concerned, such as power efficiency and reliability, when designing and building application with OSH in the AI/ML domain. This study presents a quantitative taxonomy of RISC-V SoC and reveals the opportunities in future research in machine learning with RISC-V open-source hardware architectures.","[Kalapothas, Stavros; Flamis, Georgios; Kitsos, Paris] Univ Peloponnese, Elect & Comp Engn Dept, Elect Circuits Syst & Applicat ECSA Lab, Patras 26334, Greece; [Galetakis, Manolis; Plessas, Fotis] Univ Thessaly, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, Volos 38221, Greece",University of Thessaly,"Kitsos, P (corresponding author), Univ Peloponnese, Elect & Comp Engn Dept, Elect Circuits Syst & Applicat ECSA Lab, Patras 26334, Greece.",kitsos@uop.gr,,"Kalapothas, Stavros/0000-0002-8261-5898",,,,,84,6,6,5,20,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2078-2489,,INFORMATION,Information,FEB,2023,14,2,,,,,,,64,10.3390/info14020064,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/info14020064,,,20,"Computer Science, Information Systems",Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI),Computer Science,9H8GQ,,gold,,,2024-08-15,WOS:000939064800001,0,"""taxonomy"" ",1,13

Understanding inequality as a representation problem is valuable but does not necessarily unpack its mechanisms. Using an epistemic justice lens, I look at scientific instruments as sites of inequality by design in environmental studies. Even when in recent years we have seen an explosion of new scientific tools in the field, how these tools reproduce inequalities is underexplored. The open science hardware movement provides an opportunity for studying this question in practice. I present findings from qualitative research with two projects of the Gathering for Open Science Hardware (GOSH) community in Latin America during 2018-2022. These findings show how researchers use open science hardware to overcome structural inequalities in environmental research. Beyond their lower cost, researchers are using open hardware to enable new ideas and concepts to emerge through flexible and repairable designs. I describe four mechanisms that enable the creation of new epistemic resources: autonomy, flexibility, impact and resilience, and I identify significant limitations to this potential. In the context of ongoing policy discussions promoting wider adoption of low-cost environmental research tools, this work provides insights for seizing the transformative potential of openness towards more fair environmental science.","[Arancio, Julieta] Drexel Univ, Ctr Sci Technol & Soc, 3101 Market St, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA",Drexel University,"Arancio, J (corresponding author), Drexel Univ, Ctr Sci Technol & Soc, 3101 Market St, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA.",jca88@drexel.edu,,"Arancio, Julieta C./0000-0002-8624-4182",Alfred P.

Mobile learning has become an essential method that design makers should adopt. The main content of this study is to explore the characteristics of learning behaviors and learning needs of creative design makers' group in forming a community of practice in the era of mobile learning.Design/methodology/approachThis study conducted questionnaire research on the potentially associated or directly associated population of design makers. The process of the study also combined observational and interview studies to compensate for the lack of questionnaire research.FindingsBased on the support of mobile learning technology, design makers share and co-create to achieve individual development and evolution of learning organizations, and produce creative value. Design-maker communities of practice form common communities in the framework of informal organizations to support continuous individual learning. Convergent interests or concerns in making things, real-world contexts based on makerspaces and hands-on practice based on real projects are the basis for forming design-maker communities of practice. A variety of open-source hardware, software and platforms that can support mobile learning are important for the development of design-maker communities of practice. The design-maker community of practice needs group factors, activity development, physical and technical resources, spatial support and institutional norms to enhance learning behaviors and satisfy learning needs.Originality/valueThe discovery and construction of these associated factors can help creative design practitioners form a lasting and virtuous organizational development. This study facilitates the formation of a social network for learning and knowledge sharing among design-maker communities of practice. It enhances the innovation ability and enthusiasm of design makers according to the population characteristics and learning needs of design makers. This study also facilitates the generation of a positive adaptive maker culture and maker spirit within design maker organizations.","[Zhang, Xin; Hu, Jieming] Donghua Univ, Coll Fash & Design, Shanghai, Peoples R China",Donghua University,"Hu, JM (corresponding author), Donghua Univ, Coll Fash & Design, Shanghai, Peoples R China.",792345590@qq.com; 56419823@qq.com,"Hu, Jieming/GRY-5239-2022",,Prosperity Plan Pre-research Project of Donghua University-Multiple Evolution and System Construction of Open Design Maker Co-creation Field; Shanghai Summit Discipline in Design;  [2020Y003];  [DD18003],Prosperity Plan Pre-research Project of Donghua University-Multiple Evolution and System Construction of Open Design Maker Co-creation Field; Shanghai Summit Discipline in Design; ;,The authors thank Huang Haoxiang and Ding Xinyi of Donghua University for their help in this thesis research.

The focus is on developing processes of collaborative design and experimentation through material engagement with technology and issues of concern. Problem-solving, here, is a tactic, while the strategy is an ongoing engagement with the problem of participation in its technological, social and political dimensions especially considering the increasing centralization and specialization of scientific and technological expertise.

One way to support stronger end users' engagement with such complex technologies is by involving them in the design process and, with the advent of Arduino prototyping platform, even in their making. While DIY practice offers the potential for stronger user engagement with physical artifacts, we know little about end users' DIY practice of making complex electronic technologies and their potential to ensure engagement with such devices. In this article, we report on interviews with 18 participants from two green communities who built and used an open source DIY energy monitor, with the aim to explore the end users DIY practices of making such complex electronic devices. Findings indicate four key qualities of DIY monitors: transparent modularity, open-endedness, heirloom, and disruptiveness, and how they contribute to more meaningful engagement with the DIY monitors, elevating them from the status of unremarkable objects to that of things. We conclude with three implications for design for supporting end user development of complex electronic DIY: designing transparent open hardware technologies, standardizing communication protocols for the current and future DIY of IoT, and deliberately calling for personal investment and labor in the assembling of DIY kits.","[Sas, Corina] Univ Lancaster, Sch Comp & Commun, Lancaster LA1 4WA, England; [Neustaedter, Carman] Simon Fraser Univ, Sch Interact Arts Technol, 515 West Hastings St, Vancouver, BC V6B 5K3, Canada",Lancaster University; Simon Fraser University,"Sas, C (corresponding author), Univ Lancaster, Sch Comp & Commun, Lancaster LA1 4WA, England.",,"Sas, Corina/AAG-2837-2021","Sas, Corina/0000-0001-9297-9612","UK Research Council through the Catalyst project, (EPSRC) [EP/I033017/1]; EPSRC [EP/I033017/1] Funding Source: UKRI","UK Research Council through the Catalyst project, (EPSRC)(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)); EPSRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC))","This work was supported by the UK Research Council through the Catalyst project, (EPSRC Grant EP/I033017/1).",,94,26,30,0,12,ASSOC COMPUTING MACHINERY,NEW YORK,"1601 Broadway, 10th Floor, NEW YORK, NY USA",1073-0516,1557-7325,,ACM T COMPUT-HUM INT,ACM Trans.

Having access to education and the means of production appears as the major factors for the implementation of this goal. 3D printing is a revolutionary technology that has the potential to bring digital manufacturing to everyone. However, the rise of personal fabrication requires an increase in printing quality, a reduction on machine cost and an increase in knowledge shared by the open hardware community. The purpose of this paper is to explore the development of a new Open Hardware printer project to address these points. Design/methodology/approach - The authors have designed and constructed a low-cost photopolymer-based 3D printer called BeamMaker. The printer is connected to a host computer and a digital-light-processing projector. This work details the design process and how improvements were implemented to reach good printing quality. The authors provide public access to the instructions, software, source code, parts list, user manual and STL and CAD files. Findings - The BeamMaker printer can build objects with a high surface quality that is comparable to the quality obtained by industrial photopolymer-based 3D printers. When testing the ability to print a sample cylinder, the printer shows higher accuracy when compared to other personal 3D printers. These findings are encouraging considering the low cost of the system. Research limitations/implications - The printing failure rate of the system has not been measured to date. The system requires some improvements to produce large objects. Practical implications - The printer cost is just USD380. This is five to eight times less expensive than popular personal 3D printers available today. The cost is 30 times less expensive than a personal photopolymer 3D printer produced by a main commercial company and yet producing results of similar quality. The authors expect good avenues for collaboration from the open-source community to continue improving these systems. Social implications - The high cost of current personal 3D printers prevents users from developing countries from entering into the open hardware trend. A dramatic reduction in printer cost such as that explored in this work might contribute to the real democratization of personal fabrication. Originality/value - The authors report on the status of three other photopolymer-based personal 3D printer projects. To the best of the authors' knowledge, BeamMaker is the first fully open hardware 3D printer project which uses this technology.","[Calderon, Ariel; Griffin, James; Cristobal Zagal, Juan] Univ Chile, Dept Mech Engn, Santiago, Chile",Universidad de Chile,"Zagal, JC (corresponding author), Univ Chile, Dept Mech Engn, Santiago, Chile.",jczagal@ing.uchile.cl,"Zagal, Juan Cristobal/F-5036-2016; Calderón, Ariel Alejandro/AAA-9472-2020; Griffin, Jillian M/F-9415-2010; Griffin, James/H-9512-2013","Calderón, Ariel Alejandro/0000-0002-7854-6543; Griffin, James/0000-0002-9179-5130",Fondecyt Chile [11110353],Fondecyt Chile(Comision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT)CONICYT FONDECYT),The authors acknowledge funding provided from Fondecyt Chile project number 11110353.,,17,13,13,1,27,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1355-2546,1758-7670,,RAPID PROTOTYPING J,Rapid Prototyping J.,,2014,20,3,,,,,245,255,,10.1108/RPJ-01-2013-0006,http://dx.doi.org/10.1108/RPJ-01-2013-0006,,,11,"Engineering, Mechanical; Materials Science, Multidisciplinary",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Engineering; Materials Science,AN9SY,,,,,2024-08-15,WOS:000340950200009,,,,20

We study the extent to which these companies are willing to align their internal organisation to cope with the external community dynamics and define beneficial modes of collaboration for all involved stakeholders. Four IoT companies adopting open-source hardware principles were selected as case studies. The data collection was based on 18 interviews highlighting both the perspectives of the companies and their corresponding communities and the opinions of key experts in the domain. In our findings, we illustrate the different manifestations of open business models and the companies' concrete approaches to working with external stakeholders. It is shown that companies with a business history more clearly claim sovereignty over their strategic decisions in a community-infused model, while, on the other hand, the community-based companies pursue a community-led strategy.","[Send, Hendrik] Hsch Tech & Wirtschaft, Berlin, Germany; [Send, Hendrik; Hoelzner, Heike] Humboldt Inst Internet & Gesell Berlin, Berlin, Germany; [Hassan, Mehera] Tech Univ Berlin, Berlin, Germany",Technical University of Berlin,"Send, H (corresponding author), Hsch Tech & Wirtschaft, Berlin, Germany.; Send, H (corresponding author), Humboldt Inst Internet & Gesell Berlin, Berlin, Germany.",hendrik.send@htw-berlin.de,,,,,,,73,0,0,7,16,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",2053-4701,,,DES SCI,DES.

Recently, the microservice-based application architecture has emerged as a potential solution that could meet the imposed challenges. In order to educate new generations of software and IT engineers to be able to develop such microservice-based applications, educators at universities should establish an efficient platform to ensure this process. This article presents the portable and lightweight platform for teaching application development based on microservices. The platform is focused on supporting lightweight publish/subscribe messaging protocols, such as MQTT, and built-on open-source hardware development boards such as Arduino/Genuino. This Smart City learning platform is designed to enable the collaborative development of systems, applications and services for the cities of the future, and it should be efficient enough to support the learning of all the necessary skills that can be used for the development of complex and large-scale systems.

Information and Communications Technology are called on to be one of the key players to get these cities to use smart devices and sensors (Internet of Things) to know at every moment what is happening within the city, in order to make decisions that will improve the management of resources. The proliferation of these ""smart things"" is producing significant deployment of networks in the city context. Most of these devices are proprietary solutions, which do not offer free access to the data they provide. Therefore, this prevents the interoperability and compatibility of these solutions in the current smart city developments. This paper presents how to embed an open sensorized platform for both hardware and software in the context of a smart city, more specifically in a university campus. For this integration, GlScience comes into play, where it offers different open standards that allow full control over ""smart things"" as an agile and interoperable way to achieve this.

We also found that complementary relationships among the four platforms accelerated the growth of the ecosystem from the perspective of an increase in the user base, 3D printer sales, 3D design contents, and the emergence of entrepreneurial firms that are developing the platforms. Consequently, we newly suggest ""complementary multiplatforms,"" a platform strategy that develops multiple platforms with complementary relationships for nurturing an innovation ecosystem.

This situation has produced different effects in today's society, among which is the empowerment of citizens, called makers, who are themselves able to generate citizen science or build assembly developments. Situated in the context described above, the current study follows a Do-It-Yourself (DIY) approach. In this way, it attempts to define a conceptual design of an Internet of Things (IoT) node, which is reproducible at both physical and behavioral levels, to build IoT nodes which can cover any scenario. To test this conceptual design, this study proposes a sensorization node to monitor meteorological phenomena. The node is called SEnviro (node) and features different improvements such as: the possibility of remote updates using Over-the-Air (OTA) updates; autonomy, using 3G connectivity, a solar panel, and applied energy strategies to prolong its life; and replicability, because it is made up of open hardware and other elements such as 3D-printed pieces. The node is validated in the field of smart agriculture, with the aim of monitoring different meteorological phenomena, which will be used as input to disease detection models to detect possible diseases within vineyards.","[Trilles, Sergio; Gonzalez-Perez, Alberto; Huerta, Joaquin] Univ Jaume 1, Inst New Imaging Technol, Av Vicente Sos Baynat S-N, Castellon De La Plana 12071, Spain",Universitat Jaume I,"Trilles, S (corresponding author), Univ Jaume 1, Inst New Imaging Technol, Av Vicente Sos Baynat S-N, Castellon De La Plana 12071, Spain.",strilles@uji.es; algonzal@uji.es; huerta@uji.es,"Huerta, Joaquín/L-6103-2018; Trilles, Sergio/AAB-1339-2019; González-Pérez, Alberto/AAA-4352-2020","Trilles, Sergio/0000-0002-9304-0719; González-Pérez, Alberto/0000-0002-9016-9357",postdoctoral programme Vali+d (GVA) [APOSTD/2016/058]; GVA doctoral stays programme [BEST/2018/053]; Universitat Jaume I-PINV 2017 [UJI-A2017-14]; European Commission through the GEO-C project (H2020-MSCA-ITN-2014) [642332],postdoctoral programme Vali+d (GVA); GVA doctoral stays programme; Universitat Jaume I-PINV 2017; European Commission through the GEO-C project (H2020-MSCA-ITN-2014),"Sergio Trilles has been funded by the postdoctoral programme Vali+d (GVA) (grant number APOSTD/2016/058) and GVA doctoral stays programme (grant number BEST/2018/053).

Its main goal is to provide a low-cost solution capable of supporting proof-of-concept implementations and rapid prototyping methodologies for both consumer and industrial IoT markets. AGILE allows developers to implement and deliver a complete (software and hardware) IoT solution for managing non-IP IoT devices through a multi-service gateway. Moreover, it simplifies the access of startups to the IoT market, not only providing an efficient and cost-effective solution for industries but also allowing end-users to customize and extend it according to their specific requirements. This flexibility is the result of the joint experience of established organizations in the project consortium already promoting the principles of openness, both at the software and hardware levels. We illustrate how the AGILE framework can provide a cost-effective yet solid and highly customizable, technological foundation supporting the configuration, deployment, and assessment of two distinct showcases, namely a quantified self application for individual consumers, and an air pollution monitoring station for industrial settings.","[Vecchio, Massimo] Fdn Bruno Kessler, OpenIoT Res Unit, I-38123 Trento, Italy; [Azzoni, Paolo] Eurotech Grp, I-33020 Amaro, Italy; [Menychtas, Andreas] BioAssist SA, Athens 11524, Greece; [Menychtas, Andreas; Maglogiannis, Ilias] Univ Piraeus, Dept Digital Syst, Piraeus 18534, Greece; [Felfernig, Alexander] Graz Univ Technol, Inst Software Technol, A-8010 Graz, Austria",Fondazione Bruno Kessler; University of Piraeus; Graz University of Technology,"Vecchio, M (corresponding author), Fdn Bruno Kessler, OpenIoT Res Unit, I-38123 Trento, Italy.",mvecchio@fbk.eu; paolo.azzoni@eurotech.com; amenychtas@bioassist.gr; imaglo@unipi.gr; alexander.felfernig@ist.tugraz.at,"Maglogiannis, Ilias/X-5484-2018; Vecchio, Massimo/B-2539-2013; Menychtas, Andreas/GXF-2195-2022","Maglogiannis, Ilias/0000-0003-2860-399X; Vecchio, Massimo/0000-0003-4426-8220; Menychtas, Andreas/0000-0002-4510-5522; Azzoni, Paolo/0000-0002-3324-6133",AGILE project within the Horizon 2020 programme of the European Union [688088],AGILE project within the Horizon 2020 programme of the European Union,This work was supported by the AGILE project (grant agreement No 688088) within the Horizon 2020 programme of the European Union.,,37,5,5,0,2,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,1424-8220,,SENSORS-BASEL,Sensors,FEB,2021,21,4,,,,,,,1309,10.3390/s21041309,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/s21041309,,,14,"Chemistry, Analytical; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Instruments & Instrumentation",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Chemistry; Engineering; Instruments & Instrumentation,QQ6YX,33673065.0,"Green Published, gold",,,2024-08-15,WOS:000624669900001,,,,32

Local collaboration with hospitals and healthcare professionals were established. These bottom-up initiatives from maker networks across the globe are showing us how responsible innovation is happening outside the constraints of profit-driven large industries. In this qualitative study we present five cases from a global network of makers that contributed to the production of personal protective equipment (PPE) and healthcare-related products. We draw our cases from the experiences made in Careables, a mixed community of people and organizations committed to the co-design and making of open, personalized healthcare for everyone. With the presented cases we reflect on the potential implications for post-pandemic local production of healthcare products and analyze them from a social innovation perspective.

A modular, platform-based, approach is the way to obtain this result. Modular approaches are common for software development, but hardware is still crafted often re-inventing solutions every time. As a consequence, the resources that should be invested in the development of a new robot get often drained by the implementation of a physical, working prototype to test the application idea. To overcome this problem, we propose R2P (Rapid Robot Prototyping), a framework to implement real-time, high-quality architectures for robotic systems with off-the-shelf basic modules (e.g., sensors, actuators, and controllers), integrating hardware and software, which can be assembled in a plug-and-play way. R2P provides hardware modules, a protocol for real-time communication, a middleware to connect components as well as tools to support the development of software on the modules. R2P aims at dramatically reduce time and efforts required to build a prototype robot, making it possible to focus the resources on the development of new robotic applications instead of struggling on their implementation. This enables also people with experience in a specific application domain, but with little technical background, to actively participate in the development of new robotic applications.

While deploying artificial intelligence (AI) models is becoming easier in O-RAN, one significant challenge that has been long neglected is the comprehensive testing of their performance in realistic environments. This article presents a general automated, distributed and AI-enabled testing framework to test AI models deployed in O-RAN in terms of their decision-making perfor-mance, vulnerability and security. This framework adopts a master-actor architecture to manage a number of end devices for distributed testing. More importantly, it leverages AI to automatically and intelligently explore the decision space of AI models in O-RAN.

The objective of this study is to investigate the potential of open-source (OS) technologies in an educational setting, given the combination of economic constraints affecting all educational environments and the ability of OS design to profoundly decrease the cost of technological tools and technological innovation. Methods: This paper reports on a 3-day workshop augmented with online instructional and visual tools designed for middle school and high school level educators from a wide array of disciplines (including traditional science, math, and engineering as well as computer, shop, and art). Teachers (n=22) submitted applications to participate in the workshop, the workshop was observed for both evaluation and research, teachers participated in focus groups (n=2) during the workshop in order to discuss their interest in OS 3-D printing technology and its potential role in their classrooms, and teachers completed a voluntary post-workshop survey and responded to follow-up after printers were in the classroom for one year. Results: During the workshop teachers built 3-D printers using OS technologies that they were then able to take back to their schools and into their classrooms. Conclusion: Through workshops augmented with online instructional and visual tools designed to provide facilitated yet self-directed engagement with a new, relatively unknown, and relatively complex technology, paired teacher teams were able to successfully build and use RepRap 3-D printers based on OS design in just three days. Practice: Here, we discuss both what the teachers learned and what we learned from the teachers regarding the potential for educators to construct OS 3-D printing technologies as a tool of empowering and transformative education. Implications: Open-source 3-D printing technologies have the potential to improve education through a sense of empowerment resulting from active participation, as well as through cross-curriculum engagement.

Noise can cause several problems in functioning within urban settlements and may result in a variety of health problems. Continuous monitoring, prevention, and active work on solving these problems are in the focus of research communities, local and national agencies and organizations, and many international organizations. Traffic noise on city roads has been identified as one of the major problems in urban settlements. Fortunately, it can be monitored and controlled in a way that can reduce its level and negative effects. One of the most effective and cheapest ways to monitor and control traffic noise is to use wireless sensor networks, IoT technology, and cloud-based architectures. This article presents an approach in designing urban traffic noise monitoring system based on LoRaWAN and microservices oriented architecture supported with open-source hardware and software solutions. Design of the system includes planning LoRaWAN network and development of the IoT system layered architecture. Methods for traffic routing and rerouting in urban areas, based on experiments that uses Dijkstra and Floyd-Warshall algorithms are presented.

Open systems have a reputation for being difficult to acquire, poorly documented, and hard to maintain. With the arrival of more powerful and compact integrated circuits, rapid prototyping services, and web-based tools for collaborative development, these stereotypes must be reconsidered. We discuss some of the reasons why multichannel extracellular electrophysiology could benefit from open-source approaches and describe examples of successful community-driven tool development within this field. In order to promote the adoption of open-source hardware and to reduce the need for redundant development efforts, we advocate a move toward standardized interfaces that connect each element of the data processing pipeline.

Unfortunately, some 3-D printing manufacturing companies began deviating from open-source principles and violating licenses for the detriment of the community. To determine if a pattern has emerged of companies patenting clearly open-source innovations, this study presents three case studies from the three primary regions of open-source 3-D printing development (EU, U.S., and China) as well as three aspects of 3-D printing technology (AM materials, an open-source 3-D printer, and core open-source 3-D printing concepts used in most 3-D printers). The results of this review have shown that non-inventing entities, called patent parasites, are patenting open-source inventions already well-established in the open-source community and, in the most egregious cases, commercialized by one (or several) firm(s) at the time of the patent filing. Patent parasites are able to patent open-source innovations by using a different language, vague patent titles, and broad claims that encompass enormous swaths of widely diffused open-source innovation space. This practice poses a severe threat to innovation, and several approaches to irradicate the threat are discussed.","[Kulkarni, Apoorv; Pearce, Joshua M.] Western Univ, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, 1151 Richmond St N, London, ON N6A 3K7, Canada; [Pearce, Joshua M.] Western Univ, Ivey Sch Business, 1151 Richmond St N, London, ON N6A 3K7, Canada",Western University (University of Western Ontario); Western University (University of Western Ontario),"Pearce, JM (corresponding author), Western Univ, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, 1151 Richmond St N, London, ON N6A 3K7, Canada.; Pearce, JM (corresponding author), Western Univ, Ivey Sch Business, 1151 Richmond St N, London, ON N6A 3K7, Canada.",apoorv.kulkarni@uwo.ca; joshua.pearce@uwo.ca,"Pearce, Joshua/D-2052-2010","Pearce, Joshua/0000-0001-9802-3056",Thompson Endowment,Thompson Endowment,No Statement Available,,135,0,0,1,1,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2411-5134,,INVENTIONS-BASEL,Inventions,DEC,2023,8,6,,,,,,,141,10.3390/inventions8060141,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/inventions8060141,,,20,"Engineering, Multidisciplinary",Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI),Engineering,DG3W4,,"Green Submitted, gold",,,2024-08-15,WOS:001130846400001,,,,44

Digital manufacturing technologies have only recently become widespread and the return on investment (ROI) was not clear, so funding for open hardware development was historically sparse. This paper clarifies a method for determining an ROI for the development of scientific free and open source hardware (FOSH). By using an open source hardware design that can be manufactured digitally, the relatively minor development costs result in enormous ROIs for the scientific community. A case study is presented of a syringe pump released under open license, which results in ROIs for funders ranging from hundreds to thousands of percent after only a few months. It is clear that policies encouraging FOSH scientific hardware development should be adopted by organizations interested in maximizing return on public investments for science.","[Pearce, J.

However, the effectiveness of peer assessment is not always satisfactory due to a number of factors, such as lack of in-depth understanding of peers' work and insufficient motivation for the behavior of evaluation. Based on constructivist theory, this study proposed an Understanding-Evaluation-Backward EvaluationReflection based peer assessment (UEBR-PA) approach, which directs students to comprehensively grasp their peers' projects, undertake efficient evaluations, provide retrospective reviews on others' feedback, and ultimately, integrate this collective feedback to refine and enhance their own projects. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, a quasi-experiment was conducted in an Open-Source Hardware Project Design course with 54 university students from two classes. One class was assigned as the experimental group to conduct the peer assessment using the proposed approach, while the other class was assigned as the control group to conduct the peer assessment using the conventional presentation-evaluation-communication based approach. The results of the study indicated that the UEBR-PA approach significantly increased students' creative self-efficacy, critical thinking tendency, and learning performance.

In that respect, integrating security-aware processes into design methodologies can lead to products that are more resilient to attacks and provide native protection mechanisms capable of mitigating system vulnerabilities, hence reducing damages and recovery costs. Based on the increasing interest in open-source hardware and relying on the non-proprietary RISC-V specification, in this work we aim to explore architectural extensions serving as a baseline for establishing a Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) in microcontroller-class processor cores targeted at embedded and industrial applications, especially those with some form of latency-sensitive requirements. We point out that supporting a trusted environment in this type of systems is particularly challenging and we identify a minimum set of hardware-level protection mechanisms, with limited assumptions on the available privileged modes and protection support. The reference architecture is demonstrated by extending a lightweight RISC-V core, Ibex. As shown in the last part of our work, the proof-of-concept design achieves flexible support for isolation at a modest overhead in terms of additional hardware resources and delay, thereby fully matching the constraints of latency-sensitive deeply embedded applications.","[Cilardo, Alessandro; Mercogliano, Stefano] Univ Napoli Federico II, Naples, Italy",University of Naples Federico II,"Cilardo, A (corresponding author), Univ Napoli Federico II, Naples, Italy.",acilardo@unina.it; stefano.mercogliano@unina.it,,"Cilardo, Alessandro/0000-0002-1685-8736",Italian Ministry of University and Research (MIUR),"Italian Ministry of University and Research (MIUR)(Ministry of Education, Universities and Research (MIUR))",This work was partly supported by the Italian Ministry of University and Research (MIUR) through the SPHERE project funded within the PRIN-2017 framework.,,40,0,0,0,3,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",0026-2714,1872-941X,,MICROELECTRON RELIAB,Microelectron.

This is due to both the complex and interconnected data required for product design and manufacture, and to the centralised computing infrastructure traditionally used to manage product lifecycle data. While modern cloud-based solutions to collaborative design are gaining popularity, they diminish the control of each design partner. In contrast, software designers readily collaborate on highly complex software, while retaining direct control of the files they are editing due to the dominance of distributed version control. Distributed version control for software is often coupled with 'Developer Operations' or DevOps tools to automate critical processes and facilitate communication. This paper explores how DevOps workflows can be adapted for open development of hardware. An example of how DevOps for hardware (HardOps) can be implemented is provided by the OpenFlexure Microscope project. While much ground remains to be broken in this field, HardOps can support a new paradigm of distributed hardware development, with enormous benefits not only for open-source hardware, but also commercial hardware.","[Stirling, Julian; Bumke, Kaspar; Collins, Joel; Bowman, Richard] Univ Bath, Dept Phys, Bath, Avon, England; [Dhokia, Vimal] Univ Bath, Dept Mech Engn, Bath, Avon, England",University of Bath; University of Bath,"Stirling, J (corresponding author), Univ Bath, Dept Phys, Bath, Avon, England.",j.stirling@bath.ac.uk,"Bowman, Richard W/D-7736-2011","Bowman, Richard W/0000-0002-1531-8199; Dhokia, Vimal/0000-0002-6343-6958; Collins, Joel/0000-0002-9382-7511","Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council [EP/R011443/1, EP/R013969/1]; Royal Society [RGF\EA\181034, URF\R1\180153]; EPSRC [EP/R011443/1] Funding Source: UKRI; GCRF [EP/R013969/1] Funding Source: UKRI",Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)); Royal Society(Royal Society); EPSRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)); GCRF(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)),"This work was supported by the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council [EP/R011443/1,EP/R013969/1]; Royal Society [RGF\EA\181034,URF\R1\180153].",,19,3,3,0,3,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0951-192X,1362-3052,,INT J COMPUT INTEG M,Int.

There remain, however, various challenges with respect to the concept of Industry 4.0 before this new reality is fully integrated into the industrial sector. One such challenge is ensuring security, an essential issue in terms of both management and operational technology involving the configuration and administration of physical equipment. Another is integrating equipment from different manufacturers which must be configured and/or administered with incompatible protocols. Likewise, remote access to systems must be carried out from a browser in the web frame. This paper presents a set of tools, available as a cloud-based service, which facilitates access to the physical equipment located in a business. The access enables the end user to see and/or modify the configuration and management of data in a secure, controlled, organized and collaborative manner. In order to unify different protocols, the service makes use of the Modbus TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol) protocol, one of the most commonly used by industry in local networks. The local Modbus communications are encapsulated in the Websocket protocol to make them accessible from the cloud. The tools proposed in this paper are based on open hardware platforms and free software, and they permit local and remote sensors and actuators to be fully and easily accessed. Hence, their chief advantage is that they allow access from any internet connection, via a browser, to the physical equipment located in an industry by means of user profiles in accordance with the security level set by each individual company.","[Sanchez-Herrera, Reyes; Marquez, Marco A.; Andujar, Jose M.] Huelva Univ, Escuela Tecn Super Ingn, Huelva 21007, Spain",Universidad de Huelva,"Sánchez-Herrera, R (corresponding author), Huelva Univ, Escuela Tecn Super Ingn, Huelva 21007, Spain.",reyes.sanchez@die.uhu.es,"Andujar Marquez, Jose Manuel/L-7056-2014; Sanchez-Herrera, Maria Reyes/F-8951-2016","Andujar Marquez, Jose Manuel/0000-0002-0631-0021; Sanchez-Herrera, Maria Reyes/0000-0003-3099-7262; Marquez, Marco/0000-0003-3780-9965",,,,,44,5,5,1,9,IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC,PISCATAWAY,"445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA",2169-3536,,,IEEE ACCESS,IEEE Access,,2020,8,,,,,,10433,10442,,10.1109/ACCESS.2020.2965639,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2020.2965639,,,10,"Computer Science, Information Systems; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Telecommunications",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Computer Science; Engineering; Telecommunications,LC5XL,,"Green Submitted, gold",,,2024-08-15,WOS:000525404800007,,,,53

To achieve this aim, a wireless micro-controller with attached sensors has been used to collect the environmental data. The information obtained from the sensors is collected and stored in a flash memory card, and simultaneously is sent via WiFi to the cloud. This data is stored in an online spreadsheet, which permits us to access the information in real time. On the other hand, a comparative analysis of the results obtained from sensors has been carried out, thanks to which several guidance guidelines have been developed for the selection of the most appropriate environmental sensor for each project. Finally, an additional evaluation of the device has been carried out through the analysis of its energy performance and providing information related to the data storage and its cost of development. The current research shows a clear ability to develop monitoring systems for the building sector, which can also be extended to multiple applications of Smart Environments. The development of projects through these platforms will allow future research to tackle the existing barriers in monitoring campaigns.","[Martin-Garin, A.; Millan-Garcia, J.

Power consumption monitoring in manufacturing companies can lead to a reduction of machine tools energy wastes and consequently to lower expenses. To this end, a complete transparency of energy usage among the entire manufacturing facilities is required. Despite the small volume of material processed, micro manufacturing processes are energy intensive and the optimization of energy usage becomes critical for manufacturing sustainability. Electrical discharge machining (EDM) is considered an attractive solution for the manufacturing of microcomponents. In this paper, a low cost and modular data acquisition system, based on open-hardware and open-source software, for online energy consumption monitoring, is presented. The system described is applied for energy efficiency analysis of the micro EDM milling process by using a state of the art commercial machine tool. A number of sensors is connected to the data acquisition system to measure the energy consumption of the main sub-systems of the machine tool, data is recorded through a microcontroller, and sent to the main computer via Wi-Fi for data storage and analysis. Results show that the process efficiency depends on machine parameters but it is always far below 0.01 %.

As a result of this research, an IoT system based on open hardware and software tools was built, which is articulated within the conventional 4-layer IoT architecture (capture, storage, analysis, and visualization). With respect to the existing solutions, the advantage of this system is the use of portable SBC platforms, as well as the inclusion of machine learning models within the analysis layer. From the case study, conducted on a home lettuce crop, it is concluded that the selected tools allow capturing, monitoring, and analyzing climatological variables of interest in urban agriculture crops.

However, there is a literature gap concerning wide analysis on different versions and types of Arduino boards, which include software, hardware, and communication vulnerabilities analysis. This work analyzes the software, hardware, and communication vulnerabilities that can be found in different versions of Arduino boards (entry level, enhanced features, IoT-oriented, nonofficial and with Operating System). The results of the analysis show that, in most cases, Arduino boards present hardware and software limitations and security vulnerabilities, probably due to their low-cost requirement design. Some examples are: an easy-to-override firmware, lack of power protection or nonencrypted board communications in the case of Arduino Yun. Also, Arduino does not check bad use of memory stack, so bad memory operations may end up easily on memory corruption and unexpected behavior. All these limitations and vulnerabilities may lead to security breaches on the deployed environment. Therefore, any security management policy must take these weaknesses into account.","[Sainz-Raso, Jorge; Martin, Sergio; Diaz, Gabriel; Castro, Manuel] Univ Nacl Educ Distancia, Madrid, Spain",Universidad Nacional de Educacion a Distancia (UNED),"Martin, S (corresponding author), Univ Nacl Educ Distancia, Madrid, Spain.",jorgesr86@gmail.com; smartin@ieec.uned.es; gdiaz@ieec.uned.es; mcastro@ieec.uned.es,"Martin, Sergio/F-4716-2016; ORUETA, GABRIEL DIAZ/ABF-9707-2020; Castro, Manuel/G-2085-2016","Martin, Sergio/0000-0002-4118-0234; ORUETA, GABRIEL DIAZ/0000-0001-9246-351X; Castro, Manuel/0000-0003-3559-4235","Higher Technical School of Industrial Engineering, Universidad Nacional de Educacion a Distancia (UNED) [2022-ETSII-UNED-11]","Higher Technical School of Industrial Engineering, Universidad Nacional de Educacion a Distancia (UNED)","This work was supported in part by the Higher Technical School of Industrial Engineering, Universidad Nacional de Educacion a Distancia (UNED) under Grant 2022-ETSII-UNED-11.",,48,0,0,0,7,IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC,PISCATAWAY,"445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA",2162-2248,2162-2256,,IEEE CONSUM ELECTR M,IEEE Consum.

Early research found substantial economic savings for these technologies, but as the open source design paradigm has grown by orders of magnitude it is possible that the savings observed in the early work was isolated to special cases. Today there are examples of open source technology for science in the vast majority of disciplines and several resources dedicated specifically to publishing them. Do the tremendous economic savings observed earlier hold today? To answer that question, this study evaluates free and open source technologies in the two repositories compared to proprietary functionally-equivalent tools as a function of their use of Arduino-based electronics, RepRap-class 3-D printing, as well as the combination of the two. The results of the review find overwhelming evidence for a wide range of scientific tools, that open source technologies provide economic savings of 87% compared to equivalent or lesser proprietary tools. These economic savings increased slightly to 89% for those that used Arduino technology and even more to 92% for those that used RepRap-class 3-D printing. Combining both Arduino and 3-D printing the savings averaged 94% for free and open source tools over commercial equivalents. The results provide strong evidence for financial support of open source hardware and software development for the sciences. Given the overwhelming economic advantages of free and open source technologies, it appears financially responsible to divert funding of proprietary scientific tools and their development in favor of FOSH. Policies were outlined that provide nations with a template for strategically harvesting the opportunities provided by the free and open source paradigm. (C) 2020 The Author.

However, the fast-growing field relies heavily on specialized fabrication facilities and research equipment, which limits the active participation of researchers and beginners outside microfluidics. With the growing paradigm on do-it-yourself (DIY) biology and open-source (OS) hardware, there are many efforts to create microfluidic products by using publicly-shared or easy-to-use principles. Although this approach to technology innovation has already been initiated in the field of microfluidics, the literature on OS and DIY microfluidics is still disseminated in individual journals. In this review, we provide an overview of OS and DIY microfluidics and related technologies, in particular, how microfluidic devices can be fabricated without specialized manufacturing equipment and microfabrication facilities, and how laboratory equipment that is required to perform microfluidics research can be recreated to be affordable and customizable without specialized expertise. Thus, this review introduces subtractive and additive micromachining technologies such as laser cutting, milling, and 3D printing that are accessible even to beginners, and compare their pros and cons for microfabrication. Then, OS and DIY instruments essential for operation of microfluidic devices including precision pumps, microscopes, and centrifuges are reviewed. We discuss the challenges associated with the more-accessible, wide-spread use of microfluidics as well as potential strategies to address these challenges, which can lead to individual- and community-driven microfluidics innovation.","[Shin, Joong Ho] Pukyong Univ, Dept Biomed Engn, Busan 48513, South Korea; [Shin, Joong Ho] Pukyong Natl Univ, Ind Convergence Bion Engn 4 0, Busan, South Korea; [Choi, Sungyoung] Hanyang Univ, Dept Biomed Engn, Seoul 04763, South Korea; [Choi, Sungyoung] Hanyang Univ, Dept Elect Engn, Seoul 04763, South Korea; [Choi, Sungyoung] Hanyang Univ, Inst Nano Sci & Technol, Seoul, South Korea",Pukyong National University; Pukyong National University; Hanyang University; Hanyang University; Hanyang University,"Shin, JH (corresponding author), Pukyong Univ, Dept Biomed Engn, Busan 48513, South Korea.; Choi, S (corresponding author), Hanyang Univ, Dept Biomed Engn, Seoul 04763, South Korea.",jhshin@pknu.ac.kr; sungyoung@hanyang.ac.kr,,"Shin, Joong Ho/0000-0001-9568-8618","Basic Science Research Programthrough the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) - Ministry of Science, ICT & Future Planning (MSIP) [2020R1A2C1099869]; NRF - MSIP [2016R1A5A1010148]; National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) - Korean government (MSIT) [2020R1C1C1003567]; Korea Sanhak Foundation (KSF)","Basic Science Research Programthrough the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) - Ministry of Science, ICT & Future Planning (MSIP); NRF - MSIP; National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) - Korean government (MSIT)(National Research Foundation of Korea); Korea Sanhak Foundation (KSF)","This research was supported by the Basic Science Research Programthrough the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) funded by the Ministry of Science, ICT & Future Planning (MSIP) (2020R1A2C1099869) , and an NRF grant funded by the MSIP (2016R1A5A1010148) .

IP has been the de facto standard for seamless interconnectivity in the traditional Internet; and piggybacking on the success of IP, 6LoWPAN has been the first standardized technology to realize it for networks of resource-constrained devices. In the recent past Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) a.k.a Bluetooth Smart - a subset of the Bluetooth v4.0 and the latest v4.2 stack, has surfaced as an appealing alternative, with many competing advantages over available low-power communication technologies in the IoT space such as IEEE 802.15.4. However, BLE is a closed standard and lacks open hardware and firmware support, something that hinders innovation and development in this field. In this article, we aim to overcome some of the constraints in BLE's core building blocks by making three contributions: first, we present the design of a new open hardware platform for BLE; second, we provide a Contiki O.S. port for the new platform; and third, we identify research challenges and opportunities in 6LoWPAN-connected Bluetooth Smart. We believe that the knowledge and insights will facilitate IoT innovations based on this promising technology. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Therefore, the need for a suitable open source system that can be used as a prototype platform to test new network functionality while ensuring line-rate processing, accurate timestamping, and reduced power consumption has become evident. All these requirements cannot be achieved by using software-only solutions, but rather with hardware-based platforms such as NetFPGA. The main obstacle when using this type of open source FPGA-based solution is the cost of development, in both time and hardware development skills required. The spread of new circuit synthesis tools using high-level languages opens the door for the development of hardware-based networking applications with reasonable development effort, compared to the use of traditional hardware description languages. In this article, we describe how existing open source hardware-based platforms for networking applications will be fueled by the change in the programming model of FPGAs provided by modern high-level synthesis tools. For this, we implemented a network flow monitor using high-level languages and compared the effort spent with respect to a traditional hardware development cycle. Preliminary results are very promising, given that development time is reduced from months to weeks.","[Forconesi, Marco] Univ Cambridge, Comp Lab, Networks & Operating Syst Grp, Cambridge CB2 1TN, England; [Forconesi, Marco; Sutter, Gustavo; Lopez-Buedo, Sergio; Aracil, Javier] Univ Autonoma Madrid, E-28049 Madrid, Spain; [Lopez de Vergara, Jorge E.] Univ Autonoma Madrid, Elect & Commun Technol Dept, E-28049 Madrid, Spain",University of Cambridge; Autonomous University of Madrid; Autonomous University of Madrid,"Forconesi, M (corresponding author), Univ Cambridge, Comp Lab, Networks & Operating Syst Grp, Cambridge CB2 1TN, England.",marco.forconesi@uam.es; gustavo.sutter@uam.es; sergio.lopez-buedo@uam.es; jorge.lopez_vergara@uam.es; javier.aracil@uam.es,"Aracil, Javier/AAA-8192-2019; López de Vergara, Jorge E./A-1393-2011; Lopez-Buedo, Sergio/L-3250-2013","Aracil, Javier/0000-0001-8030-1062; López de Vergara, Jorge E./0000-0002-4057-4688;",Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness under the project PackTrack [TEC2012-33754],Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness under the project PackTrack,This work has been partially supported by the Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness under the project PackTrack (TEC2012-33754).,,11,14,14,0,8,IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC,PISCATAWAY,"445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA",0890-8044,1558-156X,,IEEE NETWORK,IEEE Netw.,SEP-OCT,2014,28,5,,,,,13,19,,10.1109/MNET.2014.6915434,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/MNET.2014.6915434,,,7,"Computer Science, Hardware & Architecture; Computer Science, Information Systems; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Telecommunications",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Computer Science; Engineering; Telecommunications,AU4KM,,,,,2024-08-15,WOS:000345579700004,,,,66

Before the tape-out, a pre-silicon design has to be thoroughly inspected by time-consuming functional verification and code review to exclude bugs. For functional verification and code review, a critical issue determining their efficiency is the allocation of resources (e.g., computational resources and manpower) to different modules of a design, which is conventionally guided by designers' experiences. Such practices, though simple and straightforward, may take high risks of wasting resources on bug-free modules or missing bugs in buggy modules, and thus could affect the success and timeline of the tape-out. In this paper, we propose a novel framework called pre-silicon bug forecast to predict the bug information of hardware designs. In this framework, bug models are built via machine learning techniques to characterize the relationship between design characteristics and the bug information, which can be leveraged to predict how bugs distribute in different modules of the current design. Such predicted bug information is adequate to regulate the resources among different modules to achieve efficient functional verification and code review. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed pre-silicon bug forecast framework, we conducted detailed experiments on several open-source hardware projects. Moreover, we also investigate the impacts of different learning techniques and different sets of characteristic on the performance of bug models. Experimental results show that with appropriate learning techniques and characteristics, about 90% modules could be correctly predicted as buggy or clean and the number of bugs of each module could also be accurately predicted.","[Guo, Qi; Chen, Tianshi; Chen, Yunji; Hu, Weiwu] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Comp Technol, State Key Lab Comp Architecture, Beijing 100190, Peoples R China; [Wang, Rui] Anhui USTC iFLYTEK Co Ltd, Hefei 230088, Peoples R China; [Chen, Huanhuan] Univ Sci & Technol China, Hefei 230027, Peoples R China; [Chen, Guoliang] Univ Sci & Technol China, Sch Comp Sci & Technol, Hefei 230027, Peoples R China","Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Computing Technology, CAS; Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Science & Technology of China, CAS; Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Science & Technology of China, CAS","Chen, TS (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Comp Technol, State Key Lab Comp Architecture, Beijing 100190, Peoples R China.",joyguoqi@gmail.com; chentianshi@ict.ac.cn; cyj@ict.ac.cn; wrui1108@mail.ustc.edu.cn; hchen@ustc.edu.cn; hww@ict.ac.cn; glchen@ustc.edu.cn,"wang, rui/JAC-6240-2023; Chen, Huanhuan/HTO-5007-2023","Chen, Yunji/0000-0003-3925-5185","Strategic Priority Research Program of the Chinese Academy of Sciences [XDA06010401-02]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [61100163, 61003064, 61222204, 61050002, 61173006, 61133004, 61173001]; National S&T Major Project of China [2009ZX01028-002-003, 2009ZX01029-001-03, 2010ZX01036-001-002]; National 863 Program of China [2012AA012202]; One Thousand Young Talents Program",Strategic Priority Research Program of the Chinese Academy of Sciences(Chinese Academy of Sciences); National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); National S&T Major Project of China; National 863 Program of China(National High Technology Research and Development Program of China); One Thousand Young Talents Program,"This work was supported in part by the Strategic Priority Research Program of the Chinese Academy of Sciences under Grant XDA06010401-02, in part by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant 61100163, Grant 61003064, Grant 61222204, Grant 61050002, Grant 61173006, Grant 61133004, and Grant 61173001, in part by the National S&T Major Project of China under Grant 2009ZX01028-002-003, Grant 2009ZX01029-001-03, and Grant 2010ZX01036-001-002, and in part by the National 863 Program of China under Grant 2012AA012202.

However, more information has not translated into a greater understanding of disease complexity to satisfy diagnostic and therapeutic needs. Challenges include noncompatible technology platforms, the need for wide-scale and long-term deployment of sensor technology (among vulnerable elderly patients in particular), and the gap between the big data acquired with sensitive measurement technologies and their limited clinical application. Major opportunities could be realized if new technologies are developed as part of open-source and/or open-hardware platforms that enable multichannel data capture sensitive to the broad range of motor and nonmotor problems that characterize PD and are adaptable into self-adjusting, individualized treatment delivery systems. The International Parkinson and Movement Disorders Society Task Force on Technology is entrusted to convene engineers, clinicians, researchers, and patients to promote the development of integrated measurement and closed-loop therapeutic systems with high patient adherence that also serve to (1) encourage the adoption of clinico-pathophysiologic phenotyping and early detection of critical disease milestones, (2) enhance the tailoring of symptomatic therapy, (3) improve subgroup targeting of patients for future testing of disease-modifying treatments, and (4) identify objective biomarkers to improve the longitudinal tracking of impairments in clinical care and research. This article summarizes the work carried out by the task force toward identifying challenges and opportunities in the development of technologies with potential for improving the clinical management and the quality of life of individuals with PD.

In the last two decades, their applications to industrial instruments, vehicles, and household appliances have reached the extent that microcontrollers are now the number-one selling electronic chip of all kinds. Simultaneously, the field of lab-on-a-chip research and technology has seen major technological leaps towards sample handling, sample preparation, and sensing for use in molecular diagnostic devices. Yet, the transformation from a laboratory based lab-on-a-chip technology to actual point-of-care device products has largely been limited to a fraction of the foreseen potential. We believe that increased knowledge of the vast possibilities that becomes available with open source microcontrollers, especially when embedded in easy-to-use development environments, such as the Arduino or Raspberry Pi, could potentially solve and even bridge the gap between lab-on-a-chip technology and real-life point of care applications. The profuse availability and extraordinary capabilities of microcontrollers, namely within computation, communication, and networking, combined with easy-to-use development environments, as well as a very active and fast moving community of makers, who are eager to share their knowledge, could potentially be the difference between a dreadful chip-in-a-lab-situation, and the next successful start-up. Here follows a brief insight into how open source microcontrollers could potentially have a transformative effect on the field of lab-on-a-chip research and technology. Details in some specific areas of application are briefly treated before addressing challenges and future perspectives.","[Trieu Nguyen; Bang, Dang Duong] Tech Univ Denmark DTU Food, Natl Food Inst, Lab Appl Micro & Nanotechnol LAMINATE, DK-2800 Lyngby, Denmark; [Andreasen, Sune Zoega; Wolff, Anders] Tech Univ Denmark, Dept Micro & Nanotechnol, DK-2800 Lyngby, Denmark",Technical University of Denmark; Technical University of Denmark,"Bang, DD (corresponding author), Tech Univ Denmark DTU Food, Natl Food Inst, Lab Appl Micro & Nanotechnol LAMINATE, DK-2800 Lyngby, Denmark.",tring@food.dtu.dk; sunez@nanotech.dtu.dk; anders.wolff@nanotech.dtu.dk; ddba@food.dtu.dk,"Nguyen, Trieu/ABI-5686-2020; Nguyen, Trieu/J-2684-2018; Nguyen, Trieu/J-8686-2019; Wolff, Anders/B-7601-2011","Nguyen, Trieu/0000-0002-3862-7373; Nguyen, Trieu/0000-0002-3862-7373; Bang, Dang Duong/0000-0001-8937-687X; Wolff, Anders/0000-0001-9596-1215",European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation program [687697]; H2020 - Industrial Leadership [687697] Funding Source: H2020 - Industrial Leadership,European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation program; H2020 - Industrial Leadership(European Union (EU)H2020 - Industrial Leadership),"This research was funded by European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation program, grant agreement No. 687697.",,40,54,58,0,28,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2072-666X,,MICROMACHINES-BASEL,Micromachines,AUG,2018,9,8,,,,,,,403,10.3390/mi9080403,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/mi9080403,,,12,"Chemistry, Analytical; Nanoscience & Nanotechnology; Instruments & Instrumentation; Physics, Applied",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Chemistry; Science & Technology - Other Topics; Instruments & Instrumentation; Physics,GS1DR,30424336.0,"Green Published, gold, Green Submitted",,,2024-08-15,WOS:000443256300037,,,,70

To assist in this aim, this paper introduces a library of open-source 3-D-printable optics components. This library operates as a flexible, low-cost public-domain tool set for developing both research and teaching optics hardware. First, the use of parametric open-source designs using an open-source computer aided design package is described to customize the optics hardware for any application. Second, details are provided on the use of open-source 3 D printers (additive layer manufacturing) to fabricate the primary mechanical components, which are then combined to construct complex optics-related devices. Third, the use of the open-source electronics prototyping platform are illustrated as control for optical experimental apparatuses. This study demonstrates an open-source optical library, which significantly reduces the costs associated with much optical equipment, while also enabling relatively easily adapted customizable designs. The cost reductions in general are over 97%, with some components representing only 1% of the current commercial investment for optical products of similar function. The results of this study make its clear that this method of scientific hardware development enables a much broader audience to participate in optical experimentation both as research and teaching platforms than previous proprietary methods.","[Zhang, Chenlong; Anzalone, Nicholas C.; Faria, Rodrigo P.; Pearce, Joshua M.] Michigan Technol Univ, Michigan Tech Open Sustainabil Technol Lab, Houghton, MI 49931 USA; [Zhang, Chenlong; Pearce, Joshua M.] Michigan Technol Univ, Dept Mat Sci & Engn, Houghton, MI 49931 USA; [Faria, Rodrigo P.; Pearce, Joshua M.] Michigan Technol Univ, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, Houghton, MI 49931 USA",Michigan Technological University; Michigan Technological University; Michigan Technological University,"Pearce, JM (corresponding author), Michigan Technol Univ, Michigan Tech Open Sustainabil Technol Lab, Houghton, MI 49931 USA.",pearce@mtu.edu,"Pearce, J.M/C-9240-2013; Pearce, Joshua/D-2052-2010","Pearce, Joshua/0000-0001-9802-3056",,,,,31,97,98,1,119,PUBLIC LIBRARY SCIENCE,SAN FRANCISCO,"1160 BATTERY STREET, STE 100, SAN FRANCISCO, CA 94111 USA",1932-6203,,,PLOS ONE,PLoS One,Mar 27,2013,8,3,,,,,,,e59840,10.1371/journal.pone.0059840,http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0059840,,,13,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Science & Technology - Other Topics,124QO,,"Green Published, gold",,,2024-08-15,WOS:000317480700064,,,,71

Currently, many emerging contaminants are difficult to measure with no field deployable sensors currently available. Hence, discrete grab samples are required for subsequent laboratory analysis. To capture the spatiotemporal variability in pollution pulses, autosamplers can be used, but commercial offerings are both expensive and have a large footprint. This can be problematic in urban environments where there is a high density of point source inputs and risk of vandalism or theft. Here, we present a small and robust low-cost autosampler that is ideally suited for deployment in urban environments. The design is based on ""off the shelf"" open-source hardware components and software and requires no prior engineering, electronics, or computer programming experience to build. The autosampler uses a small peristaltic pump to enable collection of 14 small volume samples (50 mL) and is housed in a small footprint camera case. To illustrate the technology, we present two use cases for rapid sampling of stormwater pulses of: 1) an urban river channel and 2) green roof runoff. When compared with a commercial autosampler, our device showed comparable results and enabled us to capture temporal dynamics in key water quality parameters (e.g., dissolved organic matter) following rain events in an urban stream. Water quality differences associated with differing green roof design/maintenance regimes (managed and unmanaged vegetation) were captured using the autosampler, highlighting how unmanaged vegetation has a greater potential for mitigating the rapid runoff and peaked pollutant inputs associated with impervious surfaces. These two case studies show that our portable autosampler provides capacity to improve understanding of the impact of urban design and infrastructure on water quality and can lead to the development of more effective mitigation solutions. Finally, we discuss opportunities for further technical refinement of our autosampler and applications to improve environmental monitoring. We propose a holistic monitoring approach to address some of the outstanding challenges in urban areas and enable monitoring to shift from discrete point sources towards characterization of catchment or network scale dynamics.","[Khamis, Kieran; Ouellet, Valerie; Croghan, Danny; Hannah, David M.; Krause, Stefan] Univ Birmingham, Sch Geog Earth & Environm Sci, Birmingham, England; [Khamis, Kieran; Ouellet, Valerie; Croghan, Danny; Hannah, David M.; Krause, Stefan] Inst Global Innovat, Birmingham, England; [Gonzalez, Liliana M.

Recent news regarding global warming has increased the need to save energy. In Finland, one of the major sources of energy consumption is housing. Furthermore, the heating of residential buildings accounts for up to 68% of housing energy consumption. Therefore, it is not surprising that apartment energy consumption and ways to save energy in housing are a popular research topic in Finland. In this paper, two different research areas are introduced: First, a literature survey is presented on the research subjects of energy saving in the area of real estate and housing. The goal is to gain overall knowledge of the current state of energy saving research. The overall conclusion is that knowledge of energy consumption improves efforts toward energy saving. Second, rapid prototyping with off-the-shelf devices and open source software are described. These devices are cheap to install, and a wide range of sensors are available. Consequently, it is important to deal with these topics together. The former studies provide knowledge about the usage of open hardware, open software, and open architectures with the development of prototype systems for gathering data. The literature survey gives us new information on the specialties of energy consumption measuring, offering a new area for modeling and developing prototype systems. These experiences will be taken forward and utilized in energy saving and environmentally sustainable solutions, such as Green Computing.","[Saari, Mika; Sillberg, Pekka; Gronman, Jere; Kuusisto, Markku; Rantanen, Petri; Jaakkola, Hannu] Tampere Univ, Fac Informat Technol & Commun Sci, Pohjoisranta 11A, Pori 28101, Finland; [Henno, Jaak] Tallinn Univ Technol, Sch Informat Technol, Ehitajate Tee 5, EE-19086 Tallinn, Estonia",Tampere University; Tallinn University of Technology,"Saari, M (corresponding author), Tampere Univ, Fac Informat Technol & Commun Sci, Pohjoisranta 11A, Pori 28101, Finland.",mika.saari@tuni.fi; pekka.sillberg@tuni.fi; jere.gronman@tuni.fi; markku.kuusisto@tuni.fi; petri.rantanen@tuni.fi; hannu.jaakkola@tuni.fi; jaak.henno@ttu.ee,"Saari, M./AAK-7235-2020; Jaakkola, Hannu/B-3889-2013; Henno, Jaak/AAF-2529-2019; Sillberg, Pekka/KRP-6550-2024","Sillberg, Pekka/0000-0003-2573-4775; Saari, Mika/0000-0001-7677-2355; Gronman, Jere/0000-0002-3810-9189",European Regional Development Fund; Tampere University,European Regional Development Fund(European Union (EU)); Tampere University,"This work was supported by the European Regional Development Fund.

Snowball sampling was used in this study to survey 300 people who work and have had experiences with online brand communities for open source hardware (OSHW) at Fab Lab Seoul. The findings of this study indicate that content, consumer support, user interface, and reward are among the five factors that trigger an online brand community to develop a social OSHW platform. However, this study also found that brand reputation was insignificant relative to activating a social media platform for open-source software. In addition, activating a social platform for OSHW can positively affect to the brand community's loyalty for OSHW, which means that social platform innovation for OSHW can help form the positive attitude necessary to develop and diffuse an OSHW culture in a rapidly changing ICT ecosystem. This can be an important strategy for OSHW business and can contribute to the growth of the IoT market in South Korea. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Obtaining real-time non-invasive information to monitor crops or make yield predictions is a challenge. An approach is to use crop yield models in combination with real-time data used as input in such models. It was demonstrated that it is possible to design an accurate system using open source hardware and open systems to record the input for these models and monitor crops. The system presented has two main components: a device that records environmental parameters and a smartphone application (software) that links this device to a data server in order to process and analyse the information. The solution is scalable in terms of the type of sensors used (i.e. temperature and relative humidity of the air or soil), the rate of information retrieval and so on, so it can be used in various scenarios, including environmental or land policy monitoring. Moreover, this open source hardware can be used by a broad variety of users and is an alternative in poor rural areas because of its low cost compared to other solutions. It can enable increased agricultural production and management of the local environment, bringing new agricultural practices to these areas. Furthermore, progress in the use of this type of technology can help to develop new capabilities for growers. Results of calibration tests and measurements to demonstrate the usefulness of this system in precision agriculture are presented. (C) 2015 IAgrE. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Additionally, open-source hardware and field-programable gate arrays (FPGAs) are gaining traction via newly developed tools, frameworks, and HDLs. This enables new methods of creating hardware and systems faster, more simply, and more efficiently. In this paper, the implementation of a system-on-chip (SoC) based on a 32-bit RISC-V processor with lightweight cryptographic accelerator cores in FPGA and an open-source integrating framework is presented. The system consists of a 32-bit VexRiscv processor, written in SpinalHDL, and lightweight cryptographic accelerator cores for the PRINCE block cipher, the PRESENT-80 block cipher, the ChaCha stream cipher, and the SHA3-512 hash function, written in Verilog HDL and optimized for low latency with fewer clock cycles. The primary aim of this work was to develop a customized SoC platform with a register-controlled bus suitable for integrating lightweight cryptographic cores to become compact embedded systems that require encryption functionalities. Additionally, custom firmware was developed to verify the functionality of the SoC with all integrated accelerator cores, and to evaluate the speed of cryptographic processing. The proposed system was successfully implemented in a Xilinx Nexys4 DDR FPGA development board. The resources of the system in the FPGA were low with 11,830 LUTs and 9552 FFs. The proposed system can be applicable to enhancing the security of Internet of Things systems.","[Ma, Khai-Minh; Le, Duc-Hung] Vietnam Natl Univ Ho Chi Minh City, Univ Sci, Fac Elect & Telecommun, Ho Chi Minh City 700000, Vietnam; [Pham, Cong-Kha; Hoang, Trong-Thuc] Univ Electrocommun UEC, Dept Comp & Network Engn, Tokyo 1828585, Japan",Vietnam National University Hochiminh City; University of Electro-Communications - Japan,"Le, DH (corresponding author), Vietnam Natl Univ Ho Chi Minh City, Univ Sci, Fac Elect & Telecommun, Ho Chi Minh City 700000, Vietnam.",ldhung@hcmus.edu.vn,"Pham, Cong-Kha/GYV-6076-2022","Pham, Cong-Kha/0000-0001-5255-4919; Le, Duc-Hung/0000-0003-3227-9117","University of Science, VNU-HCM [DT-VT 2023-01]","University of Science, VNU-HCM","This research was funded by the University of Science, VNU-HCM, under grant number DT-VT 2023-01.",,45,1,1,2,9,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,1999-5903,,FUTURE INTERNET,Future Internet,May 19,2023,15,5,,,,,,,186,10.3390/fi15050186,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/fi15050186,,,20,"Computer Science, Information Systems",Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI),Computer Science,H5VX0,,gold,,,2024-08-15,WOS:000996649100001,,,,76

Recently, the appearance of RISC-V open-source ISA creates new possibilities to develop customized computing platforms with high savings in the non-recurring engineering costs. Moreover, the current trends toward open-source hardware frameworks are aimed to reduce design time and cost for complex system-on-chip architectures. Therefore, modularity and re-usability of hardware components are major challenges for flexible hardware architectures. The motivation behind this work is to introduce a modular cluster-based many-core architecture for FPGA accelerators that is re-usable and flexible tailored to implement different many-core taxonomies with less design time and costs by using regular and replicated sets of computing, memory, and interconnection blocks. The proposed many-core architecture is built using multiple processing clusters coupled with a NoC for communication which allows a high degree of design scalability. The processing cluster inside features a configurable multi-core architecture consisting of multiple RISC-V processing elements (PE) tightly coupled with a bus-based interconnection for intra-cluster communication using parameterized scratchpad shared memory. Each PE features a single RISC-V core with a tightly coupled parameterized scratchpad local memory and generic AXI interface. Evaluation results demonstrate that the proposed architecture features a scalable computing performance of 501 MOp/s for 4 clusters and 878 MOp/s for 8 clusters. Moreover, a scalable memory bandwidth up to 4.3 GB/s is achieved for 9 clusters with a power consumption of 1.4 W per cluster utilizing 7.7% of on-chip memory resources. The many-core architecture is implemented and evaluated on Xilinx Virtex Ultrascale+ with the feature of changing the architecture configurations during run-time using dynamic and partial reconfiguration which provides more flexibility and re-usability.","[Kamaleldin, Ahmed; Hesham, Salma; Gohringer, Diana] Tech Univ Dresden, Adapt Dynam Syst, D-01069 Dresden, Germany; [Gohringer, Diana] Tech Univ Dresden, Ctr Tactile Internet Human In The Loop CeTI, D-01069 Dresden, Germany",Technische Universitat Dresden; Technische Universitat Dresden,"Kamaleldin, A (corresponding author), Tech Univ Dresden, Adapt Dynam Syst, D-01069 Dresden, Germany.",ahmed.kamal@tu-dresden.de,"Kamaleldin, Ahmed/HJY-1768-2023; Goehringer, Diana/ABG-4285-2021","Kamaleldin, Ahmed/0000-0002-7446-7741","Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG, German Research Foundation) [287022738 -TRR196]; TU Dresden","Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG, German Research Foundation)(German Research Foundation (DFG)); TU Dresden","This work was supported by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG, German Research Foundation) -Project-ID 287022738 -TRR196, and by the Open Access Funding by the Publication Fund of the TU Dresden.",,26,9,10,5,21,IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC,PISCATAWAY,"445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA",2169-3536,,,IEEE ACCESS,IEEE Access,,2020,8,,,,,,148812,148826,,10.1109/ACCESS.2020.3015706,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2020.3015706,,,15,"Computer Science, Information Systems; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Telecommunications",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Computer Science; Engineering; Telecommunications,ND7BH,,gold,,,2024-08-15,WOS:000562057000001,,,,78

Filling in the remain-der must by necessity be a multimodal effort, with traditional ocean mapping technologies such as crewed survey ships with multibeam echosounders being mixed with newer systems such as uncrewed, sail-powered mapping systems. Volunteer data from any ship with an echosounder can also be used, but although there have been commercial efforts in this field, most of these systems do not contribute data into the public arena and public entities have largely avoided this field due to the complexities of costs, data processing, and uncertainty on how to handle the effort.

All of the design has been released under an Open Hardware or Open Source license, allowing independent organizations to initi-ate data collection efforts without having to do any of the design work themselves.

This is done through distributed manufacturing, in which products are produced close to end users. There is anecdotal evidence that these opportunities are heavily geographically dependent, with some locations unable to acquire components to build open hardware at accessible prices because of trade restrictions, tariffs, taxes, or market availability. Supply chain disruptions during the COVID-19 pandemic exacerbated this and forced designers to pivot towards a la carte-style design frameworks for critical system components. To further develop this phenomenon, a case study of free and open-source solar photovoltaic (PV) racking systems is provided. Two similar open-source designs made from different materials are compared in terms of capital costs for their detailed bill of materials throughout ten locations in North, Central and South America. The differences in economic optimization showed that the costs of wood-based racks were superior in North America and in some South American countries, while metal was less costly in Central and South America. The results make it clear that open hardware designs would be best to allow for local optimization based on material availability in all designs.","[Rana, Shafquat; Powell, Jadyn; Pearce, Joshua M.] Western Univ, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, London, ON N6A 5B9, Canada; [Vandewetering, Nicholas] Western Univ, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, London, ON N6A 3K7, Canada; [Ariza, Jonathan alvarez] Engn Fac, Dept Technol Elect, Corp Universitaria Minuto Dios UNIMINUTO, Bogota 111021, Colombia; [Pearce, Joshua M.] Western Univ, Ivey Business Sch, London, ON N6G 0N1, Canada",Western University (University of Western Ontario); Western University (University of Western Ontario); Western University (University of Western Ontario),"Pearce, JM (corresponding author), Western Univ, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, London, ON N6A 5B9, Canada.; Pearce, JM (corresponding author), Western Univ, Ivey Business Sch, London, ON N6G 0N1, Canada.",nvandew@uwo.ca; jalvarez@uniminuto.edu,"Pearce, Joshua/C-9240-2013","Pearce, Joshua/0000-0001-9802-3056; Vandewetering, Nicholas/0000-0003-3901-3127; Alvarez Ariza, Jonathan/0000-0002-4024-1349",,,,,126,1,1,3,4,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2227-7080,,TECHNOLOGIES,Technologies,APR,2023,11,2,,,,,,,62,10.3390/technologies11020062,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/technologies11020062,,,17,"Engineering, Multidisciplinary",Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI),Engineering,E8KZ9,,gold,,,2024-08-15,WOS:000977980400001,,,,80

It is based on open source technology and includes a central gateway for on-site data monitoring of water quality nodes as well as an online management platform for data visualization and sensor network configuration. Likewise, the system can detect autonomously water quality parameters outside configurable thresholds and deliver management alarms. The described architecture, besides low-cost, is highly customizable, compatible with other sensor network projects, machine-learning applications, and is capable of edge computing.

The establishment of the proposed architecture is based, firstly on an abstraction approach in the functional requirements context, and secondly, on the standardization of the subsystems connectivity, in order to allow for an open, expandable, flexible, reconfigurable, energy optimized, reliable and robust hardware system. The SensoTube implementation reference model together with its encapsulation design and installation are analyzed and presented in details. Furthermore, as a proof of concept, certain use cases have been studied in order to demonstrate the benefits of migrating existing designs based on the available open-source hardware platforms to SensoTube architecture.","[Piromalis, Dimitrios; Arvanitis, Konstantinos] Agr Univ Athens, Dept Nat Resources Management & Agr Engn, Iera Odoos 75, Athens 11855, Greece; [Piromalis, Dimitrios] Piraeus Univ Appl Sci TEI Piraeus, Dept Automat Engn, P Ralli & Thivon 250, Egaleo 12244, Greece",Agricultural University of Athens; University of West Attica,"Piromalis, D (corresponding author), Agr Univ Athens, Dept Nat Resources Management & Agr Engn, Iera Odoos 75, Athens 11855, Greece.; Piromalis, D (corresponding author), Piraeus Univ Appl Sci TEI Piraeus, Dept Automat Engn, P Ralli & Thivon 250, Egaleo 12244, Greece.",piromali@teipir.gr; karvan@aua.gr,"Arvanitis, Konstantinos/CAH-3320-2022","Arvanitis, Konstantinos/0000-0002-5778-6644; Piromalis, Dimitrios/0000-0002-2711-1400",Piraeus University of Applied Sciences [80257],Piraeus University of Applied Sciences,This study was conducted with the financial support of the Research Program No. 80257 for ARM MCUs of the Piraeus University of Applied Sciences.,,128,17,18,2,22,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,1424-8220,,SENSORS-BASEL,Sensors,AUG,2016,16,8,,,,,,,1227,10.3390/s16081227,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/s16081227,,,59,"Chemistry, Analytical; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Instruments & Instrumentation",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Chemistry; Engineering; Instruments & Instrumentation,DU6KJ,27527180.0,"Green Submitted, gold, Green Published",,,2024-08-15,WOS:000382323200115,,,,83

Unlike centralized manufacturing, distributed manufacturing makes the parts and products (the prints) at (or closer to) the source of the demand, cutting out much of the traditional supply chain. Although many expect 3-D printing to take off at the household level and previous work has shown significant returns for those choosing to do so, there are still significant barriers to entry for typical consumers. Our analysis demonstrates that for an individual to make an abnormally high return on their investments in 3-D printers, they must serve others to achieve high utilization rates. The impetus to do so is created by a service that can undercut traditionally manufactured products due to affordability and customizability. Low-cost, open-source 3-D printers are now priced within range of individual entrepreneurs who can take advantage of the long tail of consumers with highly varied interests.

To achieve this purpose, we use open-source software and hardware tools to create a piece of educational equipment that is fully configurable for different sensors. We present the experimental results of two case studies: the vibration analysis of a rotor-bearing system using acceleration signals and a free-vibration study using a xylophone and a low-cost microphone. The proposed platform helps authors to complement a 4-month course named Vibration, intended for mechanical engineering students. The students who participated in the study demonstrated an improvement in their comprehension of vibration theory and modal analysis using the finite element technique.

IoT gained traction with developers and consumers in recent years, driven by low-cost open-source hardware that enables easy prototyping and testing. IoT must be a part of the educational curriculum in higher education and follow a project-based learning pedagogy. This article describes a teaching framework for embedded systems and IoT, supported by a remote laboratory (RL) to allow students to work on project-based learning. RLs are online environments that let remote users access physical hardware. The hardware is designed as multipurpose multiobjective (MPMO), that is, the hardware components can be reconfigured to suit many different and unrelated learning objectives. RL for IoT benefits from certain advantages. First, IoT activities relating to communication often involve devices set apart geographically; running them as part of a single activity in a Web platform is the most efficient way. Second, some IoT activities require an enormous amount of time before conclusions can be made, and such activities are best carried out through an online environment. Using RL to teach students about embedded systems and IoT allows them to access equipment and IoT scenarios beyond their personal space. It is shown that students have been able to undertake the activities using RL successfully.","[Maiti, Ananda; Raza, Ali; Kang, Byeong Ho] Univ Tasmania, Sch Informat & Commun Technol, Launceston, Tas 7250, Australia",University of Tasmania,"Maiti, A (corresponding author), Univ Tasmania, Sch Informat & Commun Technol, Launceston, Tas 7250, Australia.",anandamaiti@live.com; ali.raza@utas.edu.au; Byeong.Kang@utas.edu.au,"Maiti, Ananda/M-3248-2016","Maiti, Ananda/0000-0003-0785-5282; Kang, Byeong Ho/0000-0003-3476-8838",,,,,43,3,3,3,13,IEEE COMPUTER SOC,LOS ALAMITOS,"10662 LOS VAQUEROS CIRCLE, PO BOX 3014, LOS ALAMITOS, CA 90720-1314 USA",1939-1382,,,IEEE T LEARN TECHNOL,IEEE Trans.

To alleviate these difficulties and to develop and share knowledge, the community needs open architecture frameworks for simulation, chip design, and software exploration that support extensibility, scalability, and configurability, alongside an established base of verification tools and supported software. In this article, we present OpenPiton, an open source framework for building scalable architecture research prototypes from one core to 500 million cores. OpenPiton is the world's first open source, general-purpose, multithreaded manycore processor, and framework. OpenPiton is highly configurable, providing a rich design space spanning a variety of hardware parameters that researchers can change. OpenPiton designs can be emulated on FPGA5, where they can run full-stack multiuser Debian Linux. OpenPiton is designed to scale to very large core fabrics, enabling researchers to measure operating system, compiler, and software scalability. The mature code-base reflects the complexity of an industrial-grade design and provides the necessary scripts to build new chips, making OpenPiton a natural choice for computer-aided design (CAD) research. OpenPiton has been validated with a 25-core chip prototype, named Piton, and is bolstered by a validation suite that has thousands of tests, providing an environment to test new hardware designs while verifying the correctness of the whole system. OpenPiton is being actively used in research both internally to Princeton and in the wider community, as well as being adopted in education, industry, and government settings.","[Balkind, Jonathan; McKeown, Michael; Tri Nguyen; Lavrov, Alexey; Shahrad, Mohammad; Fuchs, Adi; Wentzlaff, David] Princeton Univ, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA; [Fu, Yaosheng; Payne, Samuel] NVIDIA, Santa Clara, CA USA; [Zhou, Yanqi] Baidu SVAIL, Sunnyvale, CA USA; [Liang, Xiaohua] Microsoft, Redmond, WA USA; [Matl, Matthew] Univ Calif Berkeley, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA",Princeton University; Nvidia Corporation; Microsoft; University of California System; University of California Berkeley,"Balkind, J (corresponding author), Princeton Univ, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA.",jbalkind@princeton.edu; mmckeown@princeton.edu; yfu@nvidia.com; trin@princeton.edu; zhouyanqi@baidu.com; alavrov@princeton.edu; mshahrad@princeton.edu; adif@princeton.edu; spayne@nvidia.com; xialian@mrosoft.com; mmatl@eecs.berkeley.edu; wentzlaf@princeton.edu,"Shahrad, Mohammad/J-3387-2019","Shahrad, Mohammad/0000-0002-8214-9583","NSF [CNS-1823222, CCF-1217553, CCF-1453112, CCF-1438980]; AFOSR [FA9550-14-1-0148]; Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL); Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) [FA8650-18-2-7846, FA8650-18-2-7852, N66001-14-1-4040, HR0011-13-2-0005]",NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)); AFOSR(United States Department of DefenseAir Force Office of Scientific Research (AFOSR)); Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL)(United States Department of DefenseUS Air Force Research Laboratory); Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA)(United States Department of DefenseDefense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA)),"This material is based on research sponsored by the NSF under Grants No. CNS-1823222, CCF-1217553, CCF-1453112, and CCF-1438980, AFOSR under Grant No. FA9550-14-1-0148, Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) and Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) under agreement No. FA8650-18-2-7846 and FA8650-18-2-7852 and DARPA under Grants No. N66001-14-1-4040 and HR0011-13-2-0005.

Synthetic biology is also growing in many developing countries of Africa, Asia and Latin America, where it could have a large economic impact by helping its use of genetic biodiversity in order to boost existing industries. Starting in 2011, Argentine synthetic biology developed along an idiosyncratic path. In 2011-2012, the main focus was not exclusively research but also on community building through teaching and participation in iGEM, following the template of the early ""MIT school"" of synthetic biology. In 2013-2015, activities diversified and included society-centered projects, social science studies on synthetic biology and bioart. Standard research outputs such as articles and industrial applications helped consolidate several academic working groups. Since 2016, the lack of a critical mass of researchers and a funding crisis were partially compensated by establishing links with Latin American synthetic biologists and with other socially oriented open technology collectives. The TECNOx community is a central node in this growing research and technology network. The first four annual TECNOx meetings brought together synthetic biologists with other open science and engineering platforms and explored the relationship of Latin American technologies with entrepreneurship, open hardware, ethics and human rights. In sum, the socioeconomic context encouraged Latin American synthetic biology to develop in a meandering and diversifying manner.

Proximity data acquisition usually depends on a hardware solution to which some sensors can be coupled, managed by a software that may (or may not) store, process and send acquired data to a back-end using some communication protocol. The sheer number of both proprietary and open hardware solutions, together with the diversity and characteristics of available sensors, is enough to deem the task of designing a data acquisition device complex. Factoring in the harsh operational context, the multiple DIY solutions presented by an active online community, available in-field power approaches and the different communication protocols, each proximity monitoring solution can be regarded as singular. Data acquisition devices should be increasingly flexible, not only by supporting a large number of heterogeneous sensors, but also by being able to resort to different communication protocols, depending on both the operational and functional contexts in which they are deployed. Furthermore, these small and unattended devices need to be sufficiently robust and cost-effective to allow greater in-field measurement granularity 365 days/year. This paper presents a low-cost, flexible and robust data acquisition device that can be deployed in different operational contexts, as it also supports three different communication technologies: IEEE 802.15.4/ZigBee, LoRa/LoRaWAN and GRPS. Software and hardware features, suitable for using heat pulse methods to measure sap flow, leaf wetness sensors and others are embedded. Its power consumption is of only 83 mu A during sleep mode and the cost of the basic unit was kept below the EUR 100 limit. In-field continuous evaluation over the past three years prove that the proposed solution-SPWAS'21-is not only reliable but also represents a robust and low-cost data acquisition device capable of gathering different parameters of interest in PA practices.","[Morais, Raul; Mendes, Jorge; Silva, Renato; Silva, Nuno; Sousa, Joaquim J.; Peres, Emanuel] Univ Tras Os Montes & Alto Douro, Engn Dept, Sch Sci & Technol, P-5000801 Vila Real, Portugal; [Morais, Raul; Mendes, Jorge; Sousa, Joaquim J.; Peres, Emanuel] Inst Syst & Comp Engn Technol & Sci INESC TEC, P-4200465 Porto, Portugal",University of Tras-os-Montes & Alto Douro; INESC TEC,"Morais, R (corresponding author), Univ Tras Os Montes & Alto Douro, Engn Dept, Sch Sci & Technol, P-5000801 Vila Real, Portugal.; Morais, R (corresponding author), Inst Syst & Comp Engn Technol & Sci INESC TEC, P-4200465 Porto, Portugal.",rmorais@utad.pt; jorge_mendes_1@hotmail.com; renato.silva.an@gmail.com; nmsps@hotmail.com; jjsousa@utad.pt; eperes@utad.pt,"Morais, Raul/C-1573-2015; Peres, Emanuel/E-8392-2011","Morais, Raul/0000-0003-2440-9153; Peres, Emanuel/0000-0001-5669-7976; Sousa, Joaquim Joao/0000-0003-4533-930X; Mendes, Jorge/0000-0002-0506-9256; Silva, Nuno/0000-0001-8943-9594","National Funds through the Portuguese funding agency, FCT-Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia [UIDB/50014/2020]; project SIAPD-Sistema integrado transregional de apoio ao combate de pragas e doencas na agricultura [0655_SIAPD_6_P]; ERDF-European Regional Development Fund through the Interreg V-A SpainPortugal Program (POCTEP); FCT [SFRH/BD/129813/2017, SFRH/BD/137968/2018]; Portuguese State Budget; European Union Community Budget through the ESF-European Social Fund; Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia [SFRH/BD/137968/2018, SFRH/BD/129813/2017] Funding Source: FCT","National Funds through the Portuguese funding agency, FCT-Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia(Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia (FCT)); project SIAPD-Sistema integrado transregional de apoio ao combate de pragas e doencas na agricultura; ERDF-European Regional Development Fund through the Interreg V-A SpainPortugal Program (POCTEP)(Interreg Europe); FCT(Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia (FCT)); Portuguese State Budget; European Union Community Budget through the ESF-European Social Fund; Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia(Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia (FCT))","This work is financed by National Funds through the Portuguese funding agency, FCTFundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia-within project UIDB/50014/2020, by project SIAPD-Sistema integrado transregional de apoio ao combate de pragas e doencas na agricultura (0655_SIAPD_6_P) -co-financed by the ERDF-European Regional Development Fund through the Interreg V-A SpainPortugal Program (POCTEP) 2014-2020 and by FCT as part of the doctoral fellowships with the references SFRH/BD/129813/2017 and SFRH/BD/137968/2018 with funds from the Portuguese State Budget and the European Union Community Budget through the ESF-European Social Fund.",,22,22,22,1,19,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2077-0472,,AGRICULTURE-BASEL,Agriculture-Basel,JUL,2021,11,7,,,,,,,619,10.3390/agriculture11070619,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/agriculture11070619,,,16,Agronomy,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Agriculture,UB9LV,,"Green Published, gold",,,2024-08-15,WOS:000686159900001,,,,92

In this context the development of wearable, wireless, open-source, and nonintrusive sensing solutions is still an open problem. Indeed, most of the existing commercial architectures are closed and provide little flexibility. In this paper, an open hardware architecture for designing a modular wireless sensor node for health monitoring is proposed. By separating the connection and sensing functions in two separate boards, compliant with the IEEE1451 standard, we add plug and play capabilities to analog transducers, while granting at the same time a high level of customization. As an additional contribution of the work, we developed a cosimulation tool which simplifies the physical connection with the hardware devices and provides support for complex systems. Finally, a wireless body area network for fall detection and health monitoring, based on wireless node prototypes realized according to the proposed architecture, is presented as an application scenario.","[Ciabattoni, L.; Longhi, S.; Monteriu, A.; Pepa, L.; Prist, M.] Univ Politecn Marche, Via Brecce Bianche, I-60131 Ancona, Italy; [Freddi, A.] Univ eCampus, Via Isimbardi 10, I-22060 Novedrate, Italy",Marche Polytechnic University; Universita Ecampus,"Prist, M (corresponding author), Univ Politecn Marche, Via Brecce Bianche, I-60131 Ancona, Italy.",m.prist@univpm.it,"Ciabattoni, Lucio/KLC-9241-2024; Freddi, Alessandro/M-8794-2015; , Andrea/D-5979-2014","Freddi, Alessandro/0000-0002-9880-0238; , Andrea/0000-0001-5388-8697; Longhi, Sauro/0000-0002-1997-8098; Pepa, Lucia/0000-0003-1471-092X",,,,,58,9,9,0,9,HINDAWI LTD,LONDON,"ADAM HOUSE, 3RD FLR, 1 FITZROY SQ, LONDON, W1T 5HF, ENGLAND",1687-725X,1687-7268,,J SENSORS,J.

Medical devices play an important role in managing acute and chronic respiratory failure, including diagnosis, monitoring, and providing artificial ventilation. Current commercially available respiratory devices are very effective but, given their cost, are unaffordable for most patients in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). Herein, we focus on a relatively new design option-the open-source hardware approach-that, if implemented, will contribute to providing low-cost respiratory medical devices for many patients in LMICs, particularly those without full medical insurance coverage. Open source reflects a set of approaches to conceive and distribute the comprehensive technical information required for building devices. The open-source approach enables free and unrestricted use of the know-how to replicate and manufacture the device or modify its design for improvements or adaptation to different clinical settings or personalized treatments. We describe recent examples of open-source devices for diagnosis/monitoring (measuring inspiratory/expiratory pressures or flow and volume in mechanical ventilators) and for therapy (non-invasive ventilators for adults and continuous positive airway pressure support for infants) that enable building simple, low-cost (hence, affordable), and high-performance solutions for patients in LMICs. Finally, we argue that the common practice of approving clinical trials by the local hospital ethics board can be expanded to ensure patient safety by reviewing, inspecting, and approving open hardware for medical application to maximize the innovation and deployment rate of medical technologies.","[Farre, Ramon] Univ Barcelona, Fac Med & Ciencies Salut, Unitat Biofis & Bioengn, Barcelona 08036, Spain; [Farre, Ramon] CIBER Enfermedades Resp, Madrid 28029, Spain; [Farre, Ramon] Inst Invest Biomed August Pi Sunyer, Barcelona 08036, Spain; [Gozal, David] Univ Missouri, Dept Child Hlth, Sch Med, Columbia, MO 65201 USA; [Viet-Nhung Nguyen] Natl TB Program, 463 Hoang Hoa Tham, Hanoi 118000, Vietnam; [Pearce, Joshua M.] Western Univ, Ivey Business Sch, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, London, ON N6A 5B9, Canada; [Anh Tuan Dinh-Xuan] Hop Cochin, AP HP, Serv Physiol Explorat Fonct, F-75014 Paris, France",University of Barcelona; CIBER - Centro de Investigacion Biomedica en Red; CIBERES; University of Barcelona; Hospital Clinic de Barcelona; IDIBAPS; University of Missouri System; University of Missouri Columbia; Western University (University of Western Ontario); Assistance Publique Hopitaux Paris (APHP); Universite Paris Cite; Hopital Universitaire Cochin - APHP,"Farré, R (corresponding author), Univ Barcelona, Fac Med & Ciencies Salut, Unitat Biofis & Bioengn, Barcelona 08036, Spain.; Farré, R (corresponding author), CIBER Enfermedades Resp, Madrid 28029, Spain.; Farré, R (corresponding author), Inst Invest Biomed August Pi Sunyer, Barcelona 08036, Spain.",rfarre@ub.edu,"DINH-XUAN, Anh Tuan/A-9691-2008; Farre, Ramon/L-2664-2017; Pearce, Joshua/C-9240-2013","DINH-XUAN, Anh Tuan/0000-0001-8651-5176; Gozal, David/0000-0001-8195-6036; Farre, Ramon/0000-0002-9084-7824; Pearce, Joshua/0000-0001-9802-3056",Thompson Endowment andWestern Frugal Biomedical Innovation,Thompson Endowment andWestern Frugal Biomedical Innovation,This research was partially supported by the Thompson Endowment andWestern Frugal Biomedical Innovation.,,80,4,4,1,11,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2075-4426,,J PERS MED,J.

Much has been accomplished in the ensuing two decades. Disparate and sometimes divergent developments that had been previously explored at individual private and public universities were finally centralized with increased efficiency and coherency of effort. The stated mission of the ANSS is to ""... provide accurate and timely data and information products for seismic events, including their effects on buildings and structures, employing modern monitoring methods and technologies."" In this article, an approach (xQuake) is proposed that does not interfere in any way with the mission of the National Earthquake Information Center and ANSS but instead restores much of the community focus and international collaboration that has been lost over the past two decades. xQuake uses an executable graph framework in a pipeline architecture; this framework can be seamlessly integrated into current ANSS quake monitoring systems. This newapproach incorporatesmodern approaches to computer analytics, including multitopic Kafka exchange rings, cloud computing, a self-configuring phase associator, and machine learning.

Although these renewable energy sources are now lower-cost than fossil fuels, their inherent intermittency makes them unable to supply a constant load without storage. To address these challenges, rechargeable electric batteries are currently the most promising option; however, their high capital costs limit current deployment velocities. To both reduce the cost as well as improve performance, 3D printing technology has emerged as a promising solution. This literature review provides state-of-the-art enhancements of battery properties with 3D printing, including efficiency, mechanical stability, energy and power density, customizability and sizing, production process efficiency, material conservation, and environmental sustainability as well as the progress in solid-state batteries. The principles, advantages, limitations, and recent advancements associated with the most common types of 3D printing are reviewed focusing on their contributions to the battery field. 3D printing battery components as well as full batteries offer design flexibility, geometric freedom, and material flexibility, reduce pack weight, minimize material waste, increase the range of applications, and have the potential to reduce costs. As 3D printing technologies become more accessible, the prospect of cost-effective production for customized batteries is extremely promising.","[Mottaghi, Maryam] Western Univ, Dept Mech & Mat Engn, London, ON N6A 3K7, Canada; [Pearce, Joshua M.] Western Univ, Ivey Business Sch, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, London, ON N6A 3K7, Canada",Western University (University of Western Ontario); Western University (University of Western Ontario),"Pearce, JM (corresponding author), Western Univ, Ivey Business Sch, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, London, ON N6A 3K7, Canada.",mmottagh@uwo.ca; joshua.pearce@uwo.ca,"Pearce, Joshua/C-9240-2013","Pearce, Joshua/0000-0001-9802-3056",Thompson Endowments,Thompson Endowments,No Statement Available,,217,1,1,29,29,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2313-0105,,BATTERIES-BASEL,Batteries-Basel,MAR,2024,10,3,,,,,,,110,10.3390/batteries10030110,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/batteries10030110,,,38,"Electrochemistry; Energy & Fuels; Materials Science, Multidisciplinary",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Electrochemistry; Energy & Fuels; Materials Science,MD1Z2,,"Green Submitted, gold",,,2024-08-15,WOS:001191610100001,,,,97

In this sense, the do-it-yourself (DIY) approach to build new low-cost systems or verify the correspondence of low-cost systems compared to professional devices allows the spread of application possibilities. Following this trend, the authors aim to present a complete DIY and replicable procedure to evaluate the performance of a low-cost video luminance meter consisting of a Raspberry Pi and a camera module. The method initially consists of designing and developing a LED panel and a light cube that serves as reference illuminance sources. The luminance distribution along the two reference light sources is determined using a Konica Minolta luminance meter. With this approach, it is possible to identify an area for each light source with an almost equal luminance value. By applying a frame that covers part of the panel and shows only the area with nearly homogeneous luminance values and applying the two systems in a dark space in front of the low-cost video luminance meter mounted on a professional reference camera photometer LMK mobile air, it is possible to check the discrepancy in luminance values between the low-cost and professional systems when pointing different homogeneous light sources. In doing so, we primarily consider the peripheral shading effect, better known as the vignetting effect. We then differentiate the correction factor S of the Radiance Pcomb function to better match the luminance values of the low-cost system to the professional device. We also introduce an algorithm to differentiate the S factor depending on the light source. In general, the DIY calibration process described in the paper is time-consuming. However, the subsequent applications in various real-life scenarios allow us to verify the satisfactory performance of the low-cost system in terms of luminance mapping and glare evaluation compared to a professional device.","[Salamone, Francesco; Sibilio, Sergio] Natl Res Council Italy ITC CNR, Construct Technol Inst, Via Lombardia 49, I-20098 San Giuliano Milanese, MI, Italy; [Salamone, Francesco; Sibilio, Sergio; Masullo, Massimiliano] Univ Campania Luigi Vanvitelli, Dipartimento Architettura & Disegno Ind, Via San Lorenzo, I-81031 Aversa, CE, Italy",Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche (CNR); Istituto per le Tecnologie della Costruzione (ITC-CNR); Universita della Campania Vanvitelli,"Salamone, F (corresponding author), Natl Res Council Italy ITC CNR, Construct Technol Inst, Via Lombardia 49, I-20098 San Giuliano Milanese, MI, Italy.; Salamone, F (corresponding author), Univ Campania Luigi Vanvitelli, Dipartimento Architettura & Disegno Ind, Via San Lorenzo, I-81031 Aversa, CE, Italy.",salamone@itc.cnr.it,"Sibilio, Sergio/AAH-1345-2019; Salamone, Francesco/O-4213-2015; Masullo, Massimiliano/I-3728-2019","Sibilio, Sergio/0000-0002-8750-5401; Salamone, Francesco/0000-0003-3215-3979; Masullo, Massimiliano/0000-0002-0958-7536",,,,,23,2,2,2,3,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,1424-8220,,SENSORS-BASEL,Sensors,OCT,2022,22,20,,,,,,,7706,10.3390/s22207706,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/s22207706,,,20,"Chemistry, Analytical; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Instruments & Instrumentation",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Chemistry; Engineering; Instruments & Instrumentation,5Q1SI,36298068.0,"Green Published, gold",,,2024-08-15,WOS:000873618400001,,,,98

This language makes it easy for researchers, even without programming experience, to combine the operation of several open-source devices in parallel and design their own integrated custom solutions, enabling unique and flexible approaches to the study of behavior, including video tracking of behavior and closed-loop electrophysiology.","[Lopes, Goncalo] NeuroGEARS Ltd, London, England; [Monteiro, Patricia] Univ Minho, Life & Hlth Sci Res Inst ICVS, Sch Med, Braga, Portugal; [Monteiro, Patricia] ICVS 3Bs PT Govt Associate Lab, Braga, Portugal",Universidade do Minho,"Lopes, G (corresponding author), NeuroGEARS Ltd, London, England.; Monteiro, P (corresponding author), Univ Minho, Life & Hlth Sci Res Inst ICVS, Sch Med, Braga, Portugal.; Monteiro, P (corresponding author), ICVS 3Bs PT Govt Associate Lab, Braga, Portugal.",g.lopes@neurogears.org; patriciamonteiro@med.uminho.pt,"Monteiro, Patricia/Q-7646-2017","Monteiro, Patricia/0000-0003-3288-4560","Society in Science, The Branco Weiss fellowship; European Molecular Biology Organization (EMBO) Long-Term Fellowship [ALTF 89-2016]; Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia (FCT) [PTDC/MED-NEU/28073/2017, POCI-01-0145FEDER-028073]; Foundation for Science and Technology (FCT) [UIDB/50026/2020, UIDP/50026/2020]; Norte Portugal Regional Operational Programme (NORTE 2020), under the PORTUGAL 2020 Partnership Agreement, by the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) [NORTE-01-0145-FEDER-000013, NORTE01-0145-FEDER-000023]; Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia [PTDC/MED-NEU/28073/2017] Funding Source: FCT","Society in Science, The Branco Weiss fellowship; European Molecular Biology Organization (EMBO) Long-Term Fellowship(European Molecular Biology Organization (EMBO)); Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia (FCT)(Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia (FCT)); Foundation for Science and Technology (FCT)(Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia (FCT)); Norte Portugal Regional Operational Programme (NORTE 2020), under the PORTUGAL 2020 Partnership Agreement, by the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF); Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia(Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia (FCT))","This work has been funded by Society in Science, The Branco Weiss fellowship, administered by Eidgenossische Technische Hochschule (ETH) Zurich; the European Molecular Biology Organization (EMBO) Long-Term Fellowship (ALTF 89-2016) and Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia (FCT; grant number PTDC/MED-NEU/28073/2017 and POCI-01-0145FEDER-028073).

It focuses on the use of do-it-yourself (DIY) aerial photography with balloons and kites, alongside other collaborative practices, for mapping and visualizing Bedouin political and spatial claims. Against a backdrop of increasingly technologically savvy legal-professional cultures in human-rights organizations, this article proposes that a community-based DIY approach to truth making may challenge entrenched thresholds of participation and open opportunities for creating hybrid forums in the human-rights field.

From that moment, the market was created for the development of open-source technologies to support 3D printing at each stage of the process. Consequently, several software and devices for 3D printing have been created. This paper confirms the idea that 3DP can be implemented in academic libraries as an OS solution with the benefit of ensuring low costs while maintaining sufficient accuracy. In addition, it explains how to deploy these printers, either partially or fully, and the specific open-source software and hardware tools that are usually employed in these kinds of libraries. The article is based on the author's empirical experience while conducting classes with students in 3D printing and open-source technology and operating the 3DP laboratory at the Maria Curie-Sklodowska University in Lublin, Poland.

However, its practical applications within experimental design have been slow to uptake, with researchers unsure where to even start with the dizzying array of open source hardware and software solutions available. The perceived time investment and unknown cost, especially in implementing open source hardware, has stagnated the implementation of inexpensive experimental solutions, but we sought to increase awareness to lower the barrier to participation in this space. While there are countless technical and financial advantages to integrating open source solutions into every biologist's experimental design, we put an emphasis on the ""people"" part of the equation in our symposium. This symposium championed innovative experimental designs by early career Society for Integrative and Comparative Biology researchers across all fields of biology, from plants to animals, in the lab or in the field, or even virtually engaging with the public and students. The Open Science movement operates within community norms that champion transparency, continuous development, and collaboration. These values are congruent with the priorities of reducing barriers to participation in science, and we hope our symposium's collection of open source solutions encourages readers to adopt these or other innovative designs into their own experimentation.","[Tanner, Richelle L.] Chapman Univ, Environm Sci & Policy Program, Orange, CA 92866 USA; [Onthank, Kirt L.] Walla Walla Univ, Dept Biol Sci, College Pl, WA 99324 USA",Chapman University System; Chapman University,"Tanner, RL (corresponding author), Chapman Univ, Environm Sci & Policy Program, Orange, CA 92866 USA.",richelle.tanner@richelletanner.com,,"Onthank, Kirt/0000-0001-7739-0148",Society for Integrative and Comparative Biology,Society for Integrative and Comparative Biology,This work was supported by the Society for Integrative and Comparative Biology.,,20,0,0,0,2,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",1540-7063,1557-7023,,INTEGR COMP BIOL,Integr.

Despite the research progress, the industry still doubts its applicability, especially for the functional verification of complicated processor chips. Functional verification commonly employs a simulation-based method of co-simulating the design under test with a reference model and checking the consistency of their outcomes given the same input stimuli. We observe limited collaboration and information exchange through the design and verification processes, dramatically leading to inefficiencies when applying the conventional functional verification workflow to agile development. In this paper, we propose workflow integration with collaborative task delegation and dynamic information exchange as the design principles to effectively address the challenges on functional verification under the agile development model. Based on workflow integration, we enhance the functional verification workflows with a series of novel methodologies and toolchains. The diff-rule based agile verification methodology (DRAV) reduces the overhead of building reference models with runtime execution information from designs under test. We present the RISC-V implementation for DRAV, DiffTest, which adopts information probes to extract internal design behaviors for co-simulation and debugging.

Currently, the application of these approaches is severely limited by the availability of appropriate instrumentation and by the ability to communicate experimental protocols, results and analyses. To address these issues, we have developed a low-cost, yet sophisticated open-source scientific instrument designed to enable communities of researchers, plant breeders, educators, farmers and citizen scientists to collect high-quality field data on a large scale. The MultispeQ provides measurements in the field or laboratory of both, environmental conditions (light intensity and quality, temperature, humidity, CO2 levels, time and location) and useful plant phenotypes, including photosynthetic parameters-photosystem II quantum yield (FII), non-photochemical exciton quenching (NPQ), photosystem II photoinhibition, light-driven proton translocation and thylakoid proton motive force, regulation of the chloroplast ATP synthase and potentially many others-and leaf chlorophyll and other pigments. Plant phenotype data are transmitted from the MultispeQ to mobile devices, laptops or desktop computers together with key metadata that gets saved to the PhotosynQ platform (https://photosynq.org) and provides a suite of web-based tools for sharing, visualization, filtering, dissemination and analyses. We present validation experiments, comparing MultispeQ results with established platforms, and show that it can be usefully deployed in both laboratory and field settings. We present evidence that MultispeQ can be used by communities of researchers to rapidly measure, store and analyse multiple environmental and plant properties, allowing for deeper understanding of the complex interactions between plants and their environment.","[Kuhlgert, Sebastian; Austic, Greg; Zegarac, Robert; Osei-Bonsu, Isaac; Hoh, Donghee; Bi, Kevin; TerAvest, Dan; Kramer, David M.] Michigan State Univ, MSU DOE Plant Res Lab, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA; [Chilvers, Martin I.; Roth, Mitchell G.] Michigan State Univ, Dept Plant Soil & Microbial Sci, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA; [Chilvers, Martin I.; Roth, Mitchell G.] Michigan State Univ, Grad Program Genet, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA; [Weebadde, Prabode] Venturit Inc, E Lansing, MI USA",United States Department of Energy (DOE); Michigan State University; Michigan State University; Michigan State University,"Kramer, DM (corresponding author), Michigan State Univ, MSU DOE Plant Res Lab, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA.",kramerd8@cns.msu.edu,"Chilvers, Martin I/A-3548-2010; Osei-Bonsu, Isaac/K-2911-2019; Roth, Mitchell/AAS-5685-2020; Kramer, David/B-9588-2016","Osei-Bonsu, Isaac/0000-0002-4764-1951; Roth, Mitchell/0000-0002-0798-9312; Kramer, David/0000-0003-2181-6888; Hoh, Donghee/0000-0002-0221-6484; Kuhlgert, Sebastian/0000-0002-0108-6921","U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), Office of Science, Basic Energy Sciences (BES) [DE-FG02-91ER20021]; MSU AgBioResearch program; USAID; McKnight Foundation","U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), Office of Science, Basic Energy Sciences (BES)(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); MSU AgBioResearch program; USAID(United States Agency for International Development (USAID)); McKnight Foundation","The development and testing of the MultispeQ device and PhotosynQ platform (contributions from S.K., G.A., D.T. and D.M.K.) were supported by the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), Office of Science, Basic Energy Sciences (BES) under Award no.

A common experimental platform is necessary to lower the entrance barriers of VLC and speed up the research development. In this article, we provide guidelines for prototyping VLC for IoT applications, assisted by the open-source platform OpenVLC. We also introduce the new development on OpenVLC, which guarantees support for more powerful LEDs and much longer distance (extending the communication distance from 6 m to 19 m), dimming adaption, among other features.

However, entering this field of research is difficult since such an implant requires components from many different areas of technology. Since the complete avoidance of wires is important due to the risk of infections and other long-term problems, means for wirelessly transmitting data and energy are a necessity which adds to the requirements. In recent literature, many high-tech components for such implants are presented with remarkable properties. However, these components are typically not freely available for such a system. Every group needs to re-develop their own solution. This raises the question if it is possible to create a reusable design for an implant and its external base-station, such that it allows other groups to use it as a starting point. In this article, we try to answer this question by presenting a design based exclusively on commercial off-the-shelf components and studying the properties of the resulting system. Following this idea, we present a fully wireless neuronal implant for simultaneously measuring electrocorticography signals at 128 locations from the surface of the brain.

With the advent of open hardware initiatives, engineers, scientists, hobbyists, and even people with limited electronic skills have been able to tinker with complex electronic systems. Taking advantage of these inexpensive and widely available tools and in the context of an engineering project class for undergraduates, the authors set about building a working radiosonde prototype from the ground up, based on an open hardware platform and easily accessible components. As a result, a fully functional radiosonde has been built that measures, records, and transmits pressure, temperature, humidity, and wind, plus a small camera that stores images on a flash card. A release system was also developed so that the radiosonde can be detached from a balloon upon reaching a certain height, pressure level, or flight time. Once it is released., one can attempt the recovery of the radiosonde with the help of a precalculated trajectory using a numerical mesoscale forecasting model and visualization software. The performance of the sonde Was compared with two commercial radiosondes using climate chambers and two field launches. This paper also discusses some of the more interesting capabilities foreseeable for such a platform: 1) collaboration between meteorology and engineering departments in both education and research, and 2) development of a flexible hardware platform that allows for an effective way to compare different commercially available sensors and to easily integrate new prototype sensors.

This brought about another problem: a gap between the quantity of new mechanical ventilators and the number of skilled physicians to operate them. New physicians could not complete training at the pace of ventilator production, which threatened to leave patients sitting untreated, next to unusable ventilators. To address this challenge, we developed a universal remote control system for makeshift ventilators that uses low-cost hardware add-on modules to connect to different ventilators, and a three-tier control architecture to interface the ventilators with telemedicine software.

Similarly, the concept of openly shared hardware has gained attention, due to its cost-effectiveness and the prospect of improved reproducibility. A major motivation for the development of organic electronics is its promise to deliver substantial advantages in price and manufacturability relative to its inorganic counterpart. Here, two open-source tools for organic electronics are introduced: a dip-coating device designed for thin film fabrication and a four-point probe for precisely measuring the resistance of thin films. These tools only cost a fraction of comparable commercial devices and run with open-source software to ensure a user-friendly experience. A case study demonstrates the optimization of simple fluorescent organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs) using these open-source tools achieving 4% external quantum efficiency (EQE). To characterize these OLEDs, a previously reported open-source setup for accurate efficiency measurements is used. A substantial software upgrade to this setup, which speeds up the characterization of electroluminescence, is also repor. This work contributes open-source hardware and software to the field of organic electronics, thereby lowering the entrance barrier to the field and fostering the involvement of scientists with diverse scientific backgrounds. The open-source movement has catalyzed progress in many areas of research such as software development, artificial intelligence, and hardware development. This work introduces new cost-effective, open-source hardware projects for the organic electronics community: a dip-coating device for thin film fabrication, a four-point probe for resistance measurement, and improvements to the previously reported setup for efficiency measurements of light-emitting devices. image","[Butscher, Julian F.; Gather, Malte C.] Univ St Andrews, Organ Semicond Ctr, Sch Phys & Astron, SUPA, St Andrews KY16 9SS, Scotland; [Butscher, Julian F.; Kwon, Seonil; Popczyk, Anna; Gather, Malte C.] Univ Cologne, Humboldt Ctr Nano & Biophoton, Dept Chem, D-50939 Cologne, Germany",University of St Andrews; University of Cologne,"Gather, MC (corresponding author), Univ St Andrews, Organ Semicond Ctr, Sch Phys & Astron, SUPA, St Andrews KY16 9SS, Scotland.; Gather, MC (corresponding author), Univ Cologne, Humboldt Ctr Nano & Biophoton, Dept Chem, D-50939 Cologne, Germany.",malte.gather@uni-koeln.de,,,Alexander von Humboldt Foundation (Humboldt Professorship) [RTG2591]; Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council [EP/X039250/1],Alexander von Humboldt Foundation (Humboldt Professorship)(Alexander von Humboldt Foundation); Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)),"J.F.B. acknowledges funding from Beverly and Frank MacInnis via the University of St Andrews.

The well-known simultaneous localization and mapping problem of mobile robots has been addressed in the literaturewithout specifically taking into account the robot's motion control tasks. Moreover, its implementation can cost more than the robot itself. Robot motion control strategies developed in the literature either 1) rely on sophisticated hardware platforms, 2) assume noise-free environment, or 3) are based on abstract theories, which are validated using computer simulations only. The current work solves the navigation and mapping problems of mobile robots using open-source hardware and range-only measurements from a network of radio sources. The hardware platform used in this work is customized such that it is cost-effective and easy-to-implement, addressing the aforementioned issues in developing motion control strategies. The current strategy permits the robot to estimate its position and orientation and builds a map of its operating environment using radio frequency signals received from radio sources. It then navigates through a path defined by a set of two-dimensional points on the ground using a motion control strategy in cooperation with a computational intelligence tool. The proposed robot navigation and mapping scheme was tested in an indoor laboratory environment and its performance was compared with the simulation counterpart using a commercial robot simulator.","[Miah, Md Suruz; Knoll, Jacob; Hevrdejs, Kyle] Bradley Univ, Elect & Comp Engn Dept, Peoria, IL 61625 USA",Bradley University,"Miah, MS (corresponding author), Bradley Univ, Elect & Comp Engn Dept, Peoria, IL 61625 USA.",smiah@bradley.edu,,"Miah, Md Suruz/0000-0001-6533-0770",Research Excellence Award grant; Caterpillar Fellowship Award grant of Bradley University,Research Excellence Award grant; Caterpillar Fellowship Award grant of Bradley University,This work was supported in part by a Research Excellence Award grant and in part by Caterpillar Fellowship Award grant of Bradley University.

Short-term load forecasting models enable prediction of future power consumption, thereby encouraging shifting of loads and optimizing the use of stochastic power sources and stored energy. To make the electric grid system smart and sustainable, two-way communication between the utility and consumers must be set up and the working equipment must respond digitally to the quickly changing electric demand. The proposed work exploits the power of embedded systems to design a low-cost solution for interconnecting electrical and electronic devices, controlled by the intelligent Internet of Things (IoT) paradigms. This work primarily focuses on implementing standard regression and machine learning-based architectures for smart grid load analysis and forecasting. A state of the art ecosystem for a portable load forecasting device is proposed by means of low-cost, open-source hardware that is experimentally found to be functioning with a high degree of accuracy. Further, the performance of the classical and advanced machine learning models, emulated on the device, are analyzed on the basis of various parameters, including error percentage, execution time, CPU core temperatures, and resource utilization. Overall impressive performance is demonstrated by some specific machine learning models which are considered to be suitable for the proposed framework. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc.

The efficient use of irrigation water is a key factor in coping with the food demands of an increasing world population and with the negative effects of climate change on water resource availability in many areas. In this complex context, it is important that farmers can rely on instruments and practices that enable a better management of water at the field scale, whatever the irrigation method they adopt. In this paper, we present an open-hardware device based on the Arduino technology that was developed to allow the continuous monitoring of soil water potential in the root zone for supporting irrigation scheduling at the field scale. The structure of the device is flexible and can be adapted to host different types of sensors. The results, obtained managing irrigation in a peach orchard, show that adoption of the device, together with a simple irrigation scheduling criterion, allowed a significant increase of water use efficiency without causing a reduction of the quantity and quality of crop production.

However, they suffer from some design issues related to the difficulty to implement them on different hardware platforms without additional efforts. To bridge this gap, recently, the IEEE Computational Intelligence Society has sponsored the publication of the standard IEEE Std 1855-2016 which is aimed at providing the fuzzy community with a well-defined approach to model FRBSs in a hardware-independent way. In order to provide a runnable version of an FRBS that is designed in accordance with the IEEE Std 1855-2016, the open source library Java Fuzzy Markup Language (JFML) has been developed. However, due to hardware and/or software limitations of embedded systems, it is not always possible to run an IEEE Std 1855-2016 FRBS on this kind of systems. The aim of this paper is to overcome this drawback by developing a new JFML module that assists developers in the design and implementation of FRBSs for open hardware-embedded systems. In detail, the module supports several connection types (WiFi, Bluetooth, and USB) in order to make feasible running FRBSs in a remote computer when, due to hardware limitations, it is not possible that they run locally in the embedded systems. The new JFML module is ready for ArduinoTM and Raspberry Pi, but it can be easily extended to other hardware architectures. Moreover, the new JFML module allows to automatically generate runnable files on Arduino(TM) or Raspberry Pi in order to support nonexpert users, that is, users without specific knowledge about embedded systems or without strong programming skills. The use of the new JFML module is illustrated in two case studies. (c) 2019 The Authors. Published by Atlantis Press SARL.","[Soto-Hidalgo, J.

In this regard, this concept paper introduces the Smart Drifter Cluster: an innovative approach that leverages modern ""consumer"" IoT technologies and notions. This approach enables the remote acquisition of information on Lagrangian transport and important ocean variables, similar to standard drifters. However, it offers potential benefits such as reduced hardware costs, minimal maintenance expenses, and significantly lower power consumption compared to systems relying on independent drifters with satellite communication. By combining low power consumption with an optimized, compact integrated marine photovoltaic system, the drifters achieve unlimited operational autonomy. With the introduction of these new characteristics, the Smart Drifter Cluster goes beyond its primary function of mesoscale monitoring of marine currents. It becomes readily applicable to numerous civil applications, including recovering individuals and materials at sea, addressing pollutant spills, and tracking the dispersion of marine litter. An additional advantage of this remote monitoring and sensing system is its open-source hardware and software architecture. This fosters a citizen-science approach, enabling citizens to replicate, utilize, and contribute to the improvement of the system. Thus, within certain constraints of procedures and protocols, citizens can actively contribute to the generation of valuable data in this critical field.","[Merlino, Silvia; Bianucci, Marco] Consiglio Nazl Ric ISMAR CNR, Ist Sci Marine, I-19032 Lerici, SP, Italy; [Calabro, Vincenzo; Marini, Lorenzo; Pagliai, Marco] MDM TEAM Srl, I-50121 Florence, Italy; [Giannelli, Carlotta; Sacco, Lorenzo] Univ Florence, Dept Math & Informat Ulisse Dini, I-50134 Florence, Italy",Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche (CNR); Istituto di Scienze Marine (ISMAR-CNR); University of Florence,"Bianucci, M (corresponding author), Consiglio Nazl Ric ISMAR CNR, Ist Sci Marine, I-19032 Lerici, SP, Italy.",silvia.merlino@sp.ismar.cnr.it; vincenzo.calabro@mdmteam.eu; carlotta.giannelli@unifi.it; lorenzo.marini@mdmteam.eu; marco.pagliai@mdmteam.eu; lorenzo.sacco@unifi.it; marco.bianucci@cnr.it,"Bianucci, Marco/N-7163-2015; Giannelli, Carlotta/G-2093-2014; MERLINO, SILVIA/O-2325-2015","Bianucci, Marco/0000-0002-0276-2813; SACCO, LORENZO/0000-0003-2458-5421; Giannelli, Carlotta/0000-0002-5137-1405; MERLINO, SILVIA/0000-0002-4537-2903",European Union [101000825],European Union(European Union (EU)),"This research was funded by the European Union through the project M.A.R.T.A.: SVILUPPO DI UNA INNOVATIVA MULTIPIATTAFORMA SMART DRIFTER-UMV-SAPR PER INDAGINI MARINE, POR CreO FESR Toscana 2014-2020, Call R&S 2020, Activity 1.1.5.a1.

We introduce an optical proxy measurement to detect real-time phase changes in materials. We present correlations between this optical proxy and standard X-ray diffraction measurements, describe some edge cases where the proxy measurement fails, and report key learnings from the technology-translation process. By sharing lessons learned, we hope that future open-hardware development and translation efforts can proceed with reduced friction. Throughout the paper, we provide examples of scientific impact, wherein participating laboratories used their environmental chambers to study and improve the stabilities of halide-perovskite materials. All generations of hardware bills of materials, assembly instructions, and operating codes are available in open-source repositories.

To this end, a conceptual prototype was built based on free software and open hardware technologies as a low-cost alternative to commercial equipment while maintaining the accuracy and quality of the data at the same level. The prototype was based on electrode multiplexing to make the switching process more efficient by reducing cabling complexity, whereas synchronous demodulation for signal detection was employed, providing strong rejection of spurious electrical noise, typical of urban areas where such equipment is frequently used.

Its applications include perception, learning, memory, language, decision making and neural network mapping. Recently, interest has surged in extending EEG measurements to domestic environments. However, the high costs associated with traditional laboratory EEG systems have hindered accessibility for many individuals and researchers in education, research, and medicine. To tackle this, a mobile-EEG device named ""DreamMachine"" was developed. A more affordable alternative to both lab-based EEG systems and existing mobile-EEG devices. This system boasts 24 channels, 24-bit resolution, up to 6 h of battery life, portability, and a low price. Our open-source and open-hardware approach empowers cognitive neuroscience, especially in education, learning, and research, opening doors to more accessibility. This paper introduces the DreamMachine's design and compares it with the lab-based EEG system ""asalabTM"" in an eyes-open and eyes-closed experiment. The Alpha band exhibited higher power in the power spectrum during eyes-closed conditions, whereas the eyes-open condition showed increased power specifically within the Delta frequency range.

Smart converters are simple or interleaved converters. They are equipped with controllers that are able to online impedance match for the maximum power transfer. These conversion systems are particularly feasible for photovoltaic and all renewable energies systems working in continuous changing operating conditions. Smart converters represent promising solutions in recent energetic scenarios, in fact their application is deepening and widening. In this context, the availability of a hardware platform could represent a useful tool. The platform was conceived and released as an open hardware instrument for academy and industry to benefit from the improvements brought by the researchers' community. The usage of a novel, open-source platform would allow many developers to design smart converters, focusing on algorithms instead of electronics, which could result in a better overall development ecosystem and rapid growth in the number of smart converter applications. The platform itself is proposed as a benchmark in the development and testing of different maximum power point tracking algorithms. The designed system is capable of accurate code implementations, allowing the testing of different current and voltage-controlled algorithms for different renewable energies systems. The circuit features a bi-directional radio frequency communication channel that enables real-time reading of measurements and parameters, and remote modification of both algorithm types and settings. The proposed system was developed and successfully tested in laboratory with a solar module simulator and with real photovoltaic generators. Experimental results indicate state-of-art performances as a converter, while enhanced smart features pave the way to system-level management, real-time diagnostics, and on-the-flight parameters change. Furthermore, the deployment feasibility allows different combinations and arrangements of several energy sources, converters (both single and multi-converters), and modulation strategies. To our knowledge, this project remains the only open-source hardware smart converter platform used for educational, research, and industrial purposes so far.","[Merenda, Massimo; Iero, Demetrio; Pangallo, Giovanni; Falduto, Paolo; Della Corte, Francesco G.] Univ Mediterranea Reggio Calabria, DIIES Dept, I-89126 Reggio Di Calabria, Italy; [Merenda, Massimo; Iero, Demetrio; Della Corte, Francesco G.] Spin Off Univ Mediterranea Reggio Calabria, HWA Srl, Via R Campi II Tr 135, I-89126 Reggio Di Calabria, Italy; [Adinolfi, Giovanna; Merola, Angelo; Graditi, Giorgio] ENEA CR Portici, Piazzale Enrico Fermi 1, I-80055 Naples, Italy",Universita Mediterranea di Reggio Calabria; Italian National Agency New Technical Energy & Sustainable Economics Development,"Merenda, M (corresponding author), Univ Mediterranea Reggio Calabria, DIIES Dept, I-89126 Reggio Di Calabria, Italy.; Merenda, M (corresponding author), Spin Off Univ Mediterranea Reggio Calabria, HWA Srl, Via R Campi II Tr 135, I-89126 Reggio Di Calabria, Italy.",massimo.merenda@unirc.it; demetrio.iero@unirc.it; giovanni.pangallo@unirc.it; paolo.falduto.572@studenti.unirc.it; giovanna.adinolfi@enea.it; angelo.merola@enea.it; giorgio.graditi@enea.it; francesco.dellacorte@unirc.it,"Iero, Demetrio/AAO-1064-2020; Merenda, Massimo/K-7061-2013","Merenda, Massimo/0000-0003-3668-8014; Adinolfi, Giovanna/0000-0002-7191-5502; Della Corte, Francesco/0000-0002-2407-2979",Italian Ministry of Economic Development,"Italian Ministry of Economic Development(Ministry of Economic Development, Italy)",This work was supported by the Italian Ministry of Economic Development in the framework of the Operating Agreement with ENEA for Research on the Electric System.,,17,9,9,0,3,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",2079-9292,,,ELECTRONICS-SWITZ,Electronics,MAR,2019,8,3,,,,,,,367,10.3390/electronics8030367,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/electronics8030367,,,15,"Computer Science, Information Systems; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Physics, Applied",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Computer Science; Engineering; Physics,HU9VO,,gold,,,2024-08-15,WOS:000465642600011,,,,127

In combination, these technologies can overcome data collection and maintenance problems of in situ monitoring in remote and extreme environments. Precision localisation in support of maximum efficiency mid-range inductive power transfer when recharging devices and increased throughput between drone and device are needed for data intensive monitoring applications, and to balance proximity time for devices powered by supercapacitors that recharge in seconds. The platform described in this article incorporates ultra-wideband technology to achieve high-performance ranging and high data throughput. It enables the development of a new localisation system that is experimentally shown to improve accuracy by around two orders of magnitude to 10 cm with respect to GNSS and achieves almost 6 Mbps throughput in both lab and field conditions. These results are supported by extensive modelling and analysis. The platform is designed for application flexibility, and therefore includes a wide range of sensors and expansion possibilities, with source code for two applications made immediately available as part of a open source project to support research and development in this new area.","[Polonelli, Tommaso; Benini, Luca] Univ Bologna, DEI, I-40127 Bologna, Italy; [Qin, Yuan; Yeatman, Eric M.; Boyle, David] Imperial Coll London, Dyson, London SW7 2AZ, England",University of Bologna; Imperial College London; Dyson,"Polonelli, T (corresponding author), Univ Bologna, DEI, I-40127 Bologna, Italy.",tommaso.polonelli2@unibo.it,"Polonelli, Tommaso/AAA-1261-2020","Boyle, David/0000-0002-1993-4482; BENINI, LUCA/0000-0001-8068-3806; Yeatman, Eric/0000-0003-0487-2693",U.K. Government through NSF-UKRI [NE/T011467/1]; NERC [NE/T011467/1] Funding Source: UKRI,U.K. Government through NSF-UKRI; NERC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)),This work was supported by the U.K. Government through NSF-UKRI under Grant NE/T011467/1.,,38,16,16,1,14,IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC,PISCATAWAY,"445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA",2169-3536,,,IEEE ACCESS,IEEE Access,,2020,8,,,,,,164775,164785,,10.1109/ACCESS.2020.3021370,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2020.3021370,,,11,"Computer Science, Information Systems; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Telecommunications",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Computer Science; Engineering; Telecommunications,NT4JY,,"Green Submitted, gold",,,2024-08-15,WOS:000572910400001,,,,129

Most of the high-end open-source IoT platforms include built-in peripherals, such as the universal asynchronous receiver and transmitter (UART), pulse width modulation (PWM), general purpose input output (GPIO) ports and timers, and have enough computation power to run embedded operating systems such as Linux. However, each IoT platform has its own way of configuring peripherals, and it is difficult for programmers or users to configure the same peripheral on a different platform. Although diverse open-source IoT platforms are widespread, the difficulty in programming those platforms hinders the growth of IoT applications. Therefore, we propose an easy and convenient way to program and configure the operation of each peripheral using a user-friendly Web-based software framework.

Applications range from prototyping to small-scale production, with 3D printing offering reduced logistics overheads, better design flexibility and ease of use compared with traditional fabrication methods. In addition, printer and material costs have also decreased rapidly. These advantages make 3D printing attractive for application in microfluidic chip fabrication. However, 3D printing microfluidics is still a new area. Is the technology mature enough to print complex microchannel geometries, such as droplet microfluidics? Can 3D-printed droplet microfluidic chips be used in biological or chemical applications? Is 3D printing mature enough to be used in every research lab? These are the questions we will seek answers to in our systematic review. We will analyze (1) the key performance metrics of 3D-printed droplet microfluidics and (2) existing biological or chemical application areas. In addition, we evaluate (3) the potential of large-scale application of 3D printing microfluidics. Finally, (4) we discuss how 3D printing and digital design automation could trivialize microfluidic chip fabrication in the long term. Based on our analysis, we can conclude that today, 3D printers could already be used in every research lab. Printing droplet microfluidics is also a possibility, albeit with some challenges discussed in this review.","[Gyimah, Nafisat; Rang, Toomas; Pardy, Tamas] Tallinn Univ Technol, Thomas Johann Seebeck Dept Elect, EE-19086 Tallinn, Estonia; [Scheler, Ott; Rang, Toomas; Pardy, Tamas] Tallinn Univ Technol, Dept Chem & Biotechnol, EE-19086 Tallinn, Estonia",Tallinn University of Technology; Tallinn University of Technology,"Pardy, T (corresponding author), Tallinn Univ Technol, Thomas Johann Seebeck Dept Elect, EE-19086 Tallinn, Estonia.; Pardy, T (corresponding author), Tallinn Univ Technol, Dept Chem & Biotechnol, EE-19086 Tallinn, Estonia.",nafisat.gyimah@taltech.ee; ott.scheler@taltech.ee; toomas.rang@taltech.ee; tamas.pardy@taltech.ee,"Pardy, Tamas/AAA-7474-2020","Pardy, Tamas/0000-0003-1360-4201; Gyimah, Nafisat/0000-0002-0400-9489; Scheler, Ott/0000-0002-8428-1350","Estonian Research Council [PUT1435, PRG620]",Estonian Research Council(Estonian Research Council),"The research was funded by the Estonian Research Council for funding provided under project PUT1435, PRG620.",,149,14,15,10,107,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2072-666X,,MICROMACHINES-BASEL,Micromachines,MAR,2021,12,3,,,,,,,339,10.3390/mi12030339,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/mi12030339,,,22,"Chemistry, Analytical; Nanoscience & Nanotechnology; Instruments & Instrumentation; Physics, Applied",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Chemistry; Science & Technology - Other Topics; Instruments & Instrumentation; Physics,RE0XD,33810056.0,"gold, Green Published",,,2024-08-15,WOS:000633887600001,,,,131

At the thing' leveldevices and inter-device network communicationthe core technical building blocks are generally the same as those found in wireless sensor network implementations. For the Internet of Things to continue growing, we need more plentiful resources for building intelligent devices and sensor networks. Unfortunately, current commercial devices, e.g., sensor nodes and network gateways, tend to be expensive and proprietary, which presents a barrier to entry and arguably slows down further development. There are, however, an increasing number of open embedded platforms available and also a wide selection of off-the-shelf components that can quickly and easily be built into device and network gateway solutions. The question is whether these solutions measure up to built-for-purpose devices. In the paper, we provide a comparison of existing built-for-purpose devices against open source devices. For comparison, we have also designed and rapidly prototyped a sensor node based on off-the-shelf components. We show that these devices compare favorably to built-for-purpose devices in terms of performance, power and cost. Using open platforms and off-the-shelf components would allow more developers to build intelligent devices and sensor networks, which could result in a better overall development ecosystem, lower barriers to entry and rapid growth in the number of IoT applications.","[Fisher, Roy; Kruger, Carel] Univ Pretoria, Adv Sensor Networks Res Grp, ZA-0083 Pretoria, South Africa; [Fisher, Roy; Hancke, Gerhard] City Univ Hong Kong, Dept Comp Sci, Kowloon, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Ledwaba, Lehlogonolo; Kruger, Carel] Council Sci & Ind Res South Africa, Meraka Inst, ZA-0184 Pretoria, South Africa",University of Pretoria; City University of Hong Kong,"Fisher, R (corresponding author), Univ Pretoria, Adv Sensor Networks Res Grp, Lynwood Rd, ZA-0083 Pretoria, South Africa.",rmfisher@cityu.edu.hk; lehlogonolo.ledwaba@yahoo.com; gp.hancke@cityu.edu.hk; ckrugerl@csir.co.za,"Ledwaba, Lehlogonolo P.I./AAR-6732-2021; Hancke, Gerhard/J-7187-2013","Ledwaba, Lehlogonolo P.I./0000-0002-7292-2835; Hancke, Gerhard/0000-0002-2388-3542; Kruger, Carel/0000-0002-7765-1720",City University of Hong Kong [7200375]; National Research Foundation of South Africa [TP1207183332]; Telkom; Bytes Universal Systems; Tellumat; EMC; NRF,City University of Hong Kong(City University of Hong Kong); National Research Foundation of South Africa(National Research Foundation - South Africa); Telkom; Bytes Universal Systems; Tellumat; EMC; NRF,"The work described in the paper was partially supported by a grant from City University of Hong Kong (Project No. 7200375).

With the aim of providing a low-cost device based on open-hardware and open-source software to the technicians, engineers, and scientists around the world, this paper presents the three-phase openZmeter (3Ph-oZm), an all-in-one device that allows measuring and computing electrical data related to energy and power quality features in three-phase power networks. It has been designed to perform advanced computations for voltage, current, frequency, power, and energy. 3Ph-oZm is able to process high order harmonics, and log power quality disturbance events defined according to the recommendations of some international standards organizations. The data and its associated features are processed on-site using custom software specifically designed and programmed for this purpose that relies on advanced signal analysis techniques. This smart meter significantly improves the capabilities of the single-phase version, and overcomes certain shortcomings of other commercial devices, both in terms of versatility and data acquisition and processing capabilities. The system has been calibrated and validated using laboratory testing set-up and real-world applications, such as long-term photovoltaic power plant metering. The capabilities of 3Ph-oZm can also support a variety of other electrical applications, such as three-phase induction motor health monitoring, energy savings, or microgrid state estimation.","[Viciana, Eduardo; Arrabal-Campos, Francisco M.; Alcayde, Alfredo; Banos, Raul; Montoya, Francisco G.] Univ Almeria, Dept Engn, CeiA3, Carretera Sacramento S-N, Almeria 04120, Spain",Universidad de Almeria,"Montoya, FG (corresponding author), Univ Almeria, Dept Engn, CeiA3, Carretera Sacramento S-N, Almeria 04120, Spain.",eviciana@zred.es; fmarrabal@ual.es; aalcayde@ual.es; rbanos@ual.es; pagilm@ual.es,"García, Alfredo Alcayde/R-8627-2018; Baños, Raúl/D-6433-2013","García, Alfredo Alcayde/0000-0002-2776-089X; Baños, Raúl/0000-0001-7844-4902; Viciana Gamez, Eduardo/0000-0001-9206-4105","Ministry of Science, In-novation and Universities at the University of Almeria;  [PGC2018-098813-B-C33]","Ministry of Science, In-novation and Universities at the University of Almeria;","Acknowledgments This research has been supported by the Ministry of Science, In-novation and Universities at the University of Almeria under the pro-gramme ?Proyectos de I+D de Generaci?n de Conocimiento?of the national programme for the generation of scientific and technological knowledge and strengthening of the R+D+I system with grant number PGC2018-098813-B-C33.

Simulation speed becomes even more crucial for agile and open-source hardware design methodologies, because the designers not only want to iterate on designs quicker, but they may also have less resources with which to simulate them. In this article, we execute multiple simulators and analyze them with hardware performance counters. We find some open-source simulators not only outperform a leading commercial simulator, they also achieve comparable or higher instruction throughput on the host processor. Although advanced optimizations may increase the complexity of the simulator, they do not significantly hinder instruction throughput. Our findings make the case that there is significant room to accelerate software simulation and open-source simulators are a great starting point for researchers.","[Beamer, Scott] Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Comp Sci & Engn, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA",University of California System; University of California Santa Cruz,"Beamer, S (corresponding author), Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Comp Sci & Engn, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA.",sbeamer@ucsc.edu,,,Army Research Laboratory; Army Research Office [W911NF1910466]; U.S. Department of Defense (DOD) [W911NF1910466] Funding Source: U.S. Department of Defense (DOD),Army Research Laboratory(United States Department of DefenseUS Army Research Laboratory (ARL)); Army Research Office; U.S. Department of Defense (DOD)(United States Department of Defense),This work was supported in part by the Army Research Laboratory and in part by the Army Research Office under Contract/Grant W911NF1910466.,,12,8,9,0,2,IEEE COMPUTER SOC,LOS ALAMITOS,"10662 LOS VAQUEROS CIRCLE, PO BOX 3014, LOS ALAMITOS, CA 90720-1314 USA",0272-1732,1937-4143,,IEEE MICRO,IEEE Micro,JUL-AUG,2020,40,4,,,,,112,119,,10.1109/MM.2020.2997639,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/MM.2020.2997639,,,8,"Computer Science, Hardware & Architecture; Computer Science, Software Engineering",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Computer Science,MF6AX,,Green Submitted,,,2024-08-15,WOS:000545423800013,,,,134

The review was conducted by classifying previous studies into three types of Arduino applications: field monitoring systems, wearable systems, and autonomous systems. With regard to field monitoring systems, most studies in mines were classified as atmospheric or geotechnical monitoring. In wearable systems, the health status of the miner was an important consideration, in addition to the environmental conditions of the mine. Arduino can be a useful tool as an initial prototype for autonomous mine systems. Arduino has advantages in that it can be combined with various electronic products and is cost-effective.

However, their main drawback is the high cost, which makes it almost impossible for schools to have one robot per student. Another drawback is the proprietary nature of commercial solutions, which limits the ability to expand or adapt the robot to educational needs. Different robot kit versions, which have different electronics and programming interfaces and target different age groups, make the decision of educators on which robot to use in STEM education even more complicated. In this work, we propose a new low-cost 3D-printable and unified software-based solution that can cover the needs of all age groups, from kindergarten children to university students. The solution is driven by open source and open hardware ideas, with which, we believe we will help educators in their work. We provide detail on the 3D-printable robot parts and its list of electronics that allow for a wide range of educational activities to be supported, and explain its flexible software stack that supports four different operating modes. The modes cover the needs of users that do not know or want to program the robot, users that prefer block-based programming and less or more experienced programmers who want to take full control of the robot. The robot implements the principles of continuous integration and deployment and allows for easy updates to the latest software version through its web-based administration panel. Though, in its first steps of development and testing, the proposed robot has a huge potential, due to its open nature and the community of students, researchers and educators, that potential has kept growing. A pilot at selected schools, a performance evaluation of various technical aspects and a comparison with state-of-the-art platforms will soon follow.","[Chronis, Christos; Varlamis, Iraklis] Harokopio Univ Athens, Dept Informat & Telemat, Omirou 9, Athens 17778, Greece",Harokopio University Athens,"Varlamis, I (corresponding author), Harokopio Univ Athens, Dept Informat & Telemat, Omirou 9, Athens 17778, Greece.",chronis@hua.gr; varlamis@hua.gr,"; Varlamis, Iraklis/Q-9191-2018","Chronis, Christos/0000-0002-2768-7119; Varlamis, Iraklis/0000-0002-0876-8167",Harokopio University of Athens,Harokopio University of Athens,"The authors would like to thank the students from Harokopio University of Athens who supported the development and assembly of FOSSBot so far: Eleftheria Papageorgiou, Thanassis Apostolidis, Dimitris Charitos, Giorgos Kazazis.

However, the focused skill sets of researchers who aim to facilitate their own research limit FOSH complexity. The most expensive research equipment normally requires an interdisciplinary team. To overcome this complexity barrier and obtain large returns on investment for research funders by replacing the most expensive proprietary research equipment with FOSH, new development funding mechanisms are needed. To guide such research policy, this paper provides the first analysis of the strategic national benefit of applying the FOSH approach to major research equipment for any nation. The results of an example analysis for a single nation indicate Finland's science funders could save between 2.84-27.7m(sic)/year directly on scientific equipment purchases if research hardware is converted to FOSH and the nation would likely garner the well-established concomitant benefits of increased research innovation within their economy. Finally, a detailed generalized model for determining national research policy in hardware development is derived and research policy mechanisms for accelerating FOSH deployment and greater accessibility to research equipment are discussed.","[Heikkinen, I.

Development of aquatic germplasm repositories is impeded by a lack of standardization within laboratories and across the research community. Protocols for cryopreservation are often developed ad hoc and without close attention to variables, such as cell concentration, that strongly affect the success and reproducibility of cryopreservation. The wide dissemination and use of specialized tools and devices as open hardware can improve processing reliability and save costs. The goal of the present work was to develop and prototype a modular and open-technology approach to help to standardize the cell concentration of germplasm samples prior to cryopreservation. The specific objectives were to: 1) design and fabricate prototypes of the automated concentration measurement and adjustment system (CMAS), incorporating custom peristaltic pumps and optical evaluation modules, and 2) evaluate the performance of the CMAS with biological samples. Linear regression models were obtained for estimation of aquatic sperm concentration > 10 8 cells/mL and for algae concentration > (3 x 10 5 ) cells/mL. Algae were diluted with extender medium by an automated process, resulting in a dilution precision of +/- 12.6% and +/- 6.7% in two trials, attaining means of 89% and 71% of the target cell concentration. The development of the CMAS as open technology can provide opportunities for community-level standardization in cryopreservation of aquatic germplasm and can invite new users, makers, and developers into the open-technology community. This will increase the reach and capabilities of much-needed aquatic germplasm repositories.","[Zuchowicz, Nikolas; Liu, Yue; Tiersch, Terrence R.] Louisiana State Univ, Agr Ctr, Aquat Germplasm & Genet Resources Ctr, Sch Renewable Nat Resources, Baton Rouge, LA USA; [Liu, Yue; Monroe, W.

The cost, usability and power efficiency of available wildlife monitoring equipment currently inhibits full ground-level coverage of many natural systems. Developments over the last decade in technology, open science, and the sharing economy promise to bring global access to more versatile and more affordable monitoring tools, to improve coverage for conservation researchers and managers. 2. Here we describe the development and proof-of-concept of a low-cost, small-sized and low-energy acoustic detector: ""AudioMoth."" The device is open-source and programmable, with diverse applications for recording animal calls or human activity at sample rates of up to 384 kHz. We briefly outline two ongoing real-world case studies of large-scale, long-term monitoring for biodiversity and exploitation of natural resources. These studies demonstrate the potential for AudioMoth to enable a substantial shift away from passive continuous recording by individual devices, towards smart detection by networks of devices flooding large and inaccessible ecosystems. 3. The case studies demonstrate one of the smart capabilities of AudioMoth, to trigger event logging on the basis of classification algorithms that identify specific acoustic events. An algorithm to trigger recordings of the New Forest cicada (Cicadetta montana) demonstrates the potential for AudioMoth to vastly improve the spatial and temporal coverage of surveys for the presence of cryptic animals. An algorithm for logging gunshot events has potential to identify a shotgun blast in tropical rainforest at distances of up to 500 m, extending to 1 km with continuous recording. 4. AudioMoth is more energy efficient than currently available passive acoustic monitoring devices, giving it considerably greater portability and longevity in the field with smaller batteries. At a build cost of similar to US$43 per unit, AudioMoth has potential for varied applications in large-scale, long-term acoustic surveys. With continuing developments in smart, energy-efficient algorithms and diminishing component costs, we are approaching the milestone of local communities being able to afford to remotely monitor their own natural resources.","[Hill, Andrew P.; Prince, Peter] Univ Southampton, Fac Phys Sci & Engn, Agents Interact & Complex Elect & Comp Sci, Southampton, Hants, England; [Covarrubias, Evelyn Pina; Doncaster, C.

In this article, we propose the Portiloop, a deep learning-based, portable and low-cost closed-loop stimulation system able to target specific brain oscillations. We first document open-hardware implementations that can be constructed from commercially available components. We also provide a fast, lightweight neural network model and an exploration algorithm that automatically optimizes the model hyperparameters to the desired brain oscillation.

Due to the increasing threats of information leakage, it is imperative to provide a secure RISC-V ecosystem to defend against malicious software exploits. Toward this goal, data-flow integrity (DFI) is employed as a strict security policy for enforcing the legitimacy of each data access, thereby filtering out most of the attack exploits. However, due to the intensive computations needed by DFI, there are only limited proposals successfully implementing partial DFI with low performance overhead. Moreover, all the previous studies failed to enforce the complete DFI policy in a real hardware platform, while trading off security strength for performance efficiency. To provide RISC-V architecture with high security enforcement and low performance overhead, we leverage the open-source Rocket Chip and propose RvDfi, the first complete DFI implementation based on RISC-V architecture with only 17.8% performance overhead on average and 3.9% in minimum, incurring much less performance loss compared to the 166.3% overhead caused by previous complete DFI implementation.","[Feng, Lang; Li, Luyi; Zhang, Haochen; Wang, Zhongfeng] Nanjing Univ, Sch Elect Sci & Engn, Nanjing 210023, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Huang, Jiayi] UC Santa Barbara, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA",Nanjing University; University of California System; University of California Santa Barbara,"Wang, ZF (corresponding author), Nanjing Univ, Sch Elect Sci & Engn, Nanjing 210023, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.",flang@nju.edu.cn; jyhuang@ucsb.edu; luyli@smail.nju.edu.cn; 181180179@smail.nju.edu.cn; zfwang@nju.edu.cn,"zhang, haochen/AAF-3192-2020; Li, Luyi/D-8446-2016; Huang, Jiayi/Y-2795-2019","Huang, Jiayi/0000-0003-4011-6668; Wang, Zhongfeng/0000-0002-7227-4786; Feng, Lang/0000-0001-9943-0550",National Natural Science Foundation of China [61774082]; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities [2021300341]; Key Research Plan of Jiangsu Province of China [BE2019003-4],National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities); Key Research Plan of Jiangsu Province of China,"This work was supported in part by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant 61774082, in part by the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities under Grant 2021300341, and in part by the Key Research Plan of Jiangsu Province of China under Grant BE2019003-4.",,37,1,1,1,19,IEEE COMPUTER SOC,LOS ALAMITOS,"10662 LOS VAQUEROS CIRCLE, PO BOX 3014, LOS ALAMITOS, CA 90720-1314 USA",0018-9340,1557-9956,,IEEE T COMPUT,IEEE Trans.

Unfortunately, these algorithms are proprietary, and academia has no means of directly contributing to these results. In fact, nothing at the same stage of development exists in academia. Despite the extensive research in ECG signal processing, from signal conditioning to expert systems, a cohesive single application for clinical use is not ready yet. This is due to a serious lack of coordination in the academic efforts, which involve not only algorithms for signal processing, but also the signal acquisition equipment itself. For instance, the different sampling rates and the different noise levels frequently found in the available signal databases can cause severe incompatibility problems when the integration of different algorithms is desired. Therefore, this work aims to solve this incompatibility problem by providing the academic community with a diagnostic-grade electrocardiograph. The intention is to create a new standardized ECG signals database in order to address the automatic interpretation problem and create an electrocardiography system that can fully assist clinical practitioners, as the proprietary systems do. Achieving this objective is expected through an open and coordinated collaboration platform for which a webpage has already been created.","[Gordillo-Roblero, Luis Alberto; Soto-Cajiga, Jorge Alberto; Diaz-Alonso, Daniela; Perez-Reynoso, Francisco David] Natl Lab Res Med Technol LANITEM, Ctr Engn & Ind Dev CIDESI, Pie de la Cuesta 702, Queretaro 76125, Mexico; [Jimenez-Hernandez, Hugo] Autonomous Univ Queretaro UAQ, Fac Informat, Cerro Campanas S-N, Queretaro 76010, Mexico",CIDESI - Centro de Ingenieria y Desarrollo Industrial,"Gordillo-Roblero, LA (corresponding author), Natl Lab Res Med Technol LANITEM, Ctr Engn & Ind Dev CIDESI, Pie de la Cuesta 702, Queretaro 76125, Mexico.",investigador1.lanitem@cidesi.edu.mx; jsoto@cidesi.edu.mx; daniela.diaz@cidesi.edu.mx; investigador3.lanitem@cidesi.edu.mx; hugo.jimenez@uaq.mx,"Jiménez-Hernández, Hugo/E-8276-2013; Diaz-Alonso, Daniela/L-2938-2017","Jiménez-Hernández, Hugo/0000-0003-0827-6645; Perez Reynoso, Francisco David/0000-0002-6967-9993; Diaz-Alonso, Daniela/0000-0001-9923-0604","National Council of Humanities, Science, and Technology (CONAHCyT); National Council of Humanities, Science and Technology (CONAHCyT)","National Council of Humanities, Science, and Technology (CONAHCyT); National Council of Humanities, Science and Technology (CONAHCyT)","To the National Council of Humanities, Science and Technology (CONAHCyT) for its post-graduate scholarship program.

In this way, during last decade the deployment of sensing devices has increased considerably in the field of agriculture. This fact has led to a new concept called smart agriculture, and it contemplates activities such as field monitoring, which offer support to make decisions or perform actions, such as irrigation or fertilization. Apart from sensing devices, which use the Internet protocol to transfer data (Internet of Things), there are the so-called crop models, which are able to provide added value over the data provided by the sensors, with the aim of providing recommendations to farmers in decision-making and thus, increase the quality and quantity of their production. In this scenario, the current work uses a low-cost sensorized platform, capable of monitoring meteorological phenomena following the Internet of Things paradigm, with the goal to apply an alert disease model on the cultivation of the vine. The edge computing paradigm is used to achieve this objective; also our work follows some advances from GIScience to increase interoperability. An example of this platform has been deployed in a vineyard parcel located in the municipality of Vilafames (Castello, Spain). (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc.

In robotics, it is pertinent to think that modular construction is essential, due to the complexity of geometry in each of the pieces and their manufacture. Taking into account the globalization of information and the worldwide reproduction of databases, facilitating access to CAD files to be reproduced in 3D printing promotes the easy construction of archived mechanical designs. A robotic architecture becomes a complex assembly by having multiple operating systems. The sensorics, mechanics, electronics and programming that it requires for navigation, collaboration, development, operation and even industrial manufacturing means that more and more elaborate embedded systems are used. In this work, a mobile robotics architecture was developed with a sensory system that allows free movement and navigation in closed loop inverse kinematics. This kind of robot uses navigation algorithms to take a trajectory in collaborative closed environments, that is, closed industrial environments where obstacles are normally immovable and corridors to move narrow, in addition to having mobile obstacles like humans.

It was shown that electrically stimulating the brain can be used to produce simple visual impressions of light blobs (phosphenes). This technology, using electrodes placed on top of the visual cortex, was successfully used to give blind people some degree of visual impression of their surrounding. However, this perception is very far away from natural sight. For developing the next generation of visual prostheses, real-time closed-loop stimulators are required. Such a stimulator measures the actual neuronal activities and on this basis determines the required stimulation pattern. In addition, there is a desire to shrink the diameter of the applied electrodes and increase their spatial density. This leads to the challenge of designing a system that can produce arbitrary stimulation-patterns with up to +/- 70 V and with up to 25 mA while measuring neuronal signals with amplitudes in the order of mV. Furthermore, interruptions of the measurements during stimulation should be as short as possible and the system needs to scale to hundreds of electrodes. We discuss how such a system and especially its current pumps and input protection need to be designed and which problems arise. We condense our findings into an example design for which we provide all design files (boards, firmwares and software) as open-source. This is a first step in taking the existing open-sourcewww.open-ephys.org recording system and converting it into a closed-loop experimental setup for neuro-prosthetic research. (C) 2019 The Authors.

Recently, they have begun to embrace Google's Android operating system to leverage its software ecosystem. Despite the encouraging progress, a challenging issue arises: a majority of Android applications are written in native languages and need to be recompiled to target new hardware platforms. Unfortunately, this recompilation process is not scalable because of the explosion of new hardware platforms. To address this issue, we presentWasmAndroid, a high-performance cross-platform runtime for native Android applications. WithWasmAndroid, developers can compile their source code toWebAssembly, an efficient and portable bytecode format that can be executed everywhere without additional reconfiguration. Developers can also transpile existing application binaries to WebAssembly when source code is not available. WebAssembly's language model is very different from other common languages. This mismatch leads to many unique implementation challenges. In this article, we provide workable solutions and conduct a thorough system evaluation. We show thatWasmAndroid provides acceptable performance to execute native applications in a cross-platform manner.","[Wen, Elliott; Weber, Gerald; Nanayakkara, Suranga] Univ Auckland, 70 Symonds St, Auckland, New Zealand",University of Auckland,"Wen, E (corresponding author), Univ Auckland, 70 Symonds St, Auckland, New Zealand.",jq.elliott.wen@gmail.com; g.weber@aucklanduni.ac.nz; suranga@ahlab.org,,"NANAYAKKARA, SURANGA/0000-0001-7441-5493",,,,,45,0,0,1,7,ASSOC COMPUTING MACHINERY,NEW YORK,"1601 Broadway, 10th Floor, NEW YORK, NY USA",1539-9087,1558-3465,,ACM T EMBED COMPUT S,ACM Trans.

This manuscript concerns designing a wireless sensor network system that facilitates open-source hardware platforms, ZigBee and Raspberry Pi. The embedded system architecture combines the gateway node of the wireless sensor network, database server, and web server in one single-board computer (SBC) hardware platform. The design reduces power consumption and cost by developing better scalability and lesser sensors units to improve sending and receiving data. The use of Raspberry Pi in the design enhances flexibility and reduces the cost. Further, using the Python code in programming minimizes the codes of the components and avoids errors. The choice of the Raspbian operating system for Raspberries has resulted in higher quality, better stability, and a smoother scalable operating system. Raspberry Pi acts as a base station for the ZigBee protocol. Additionally, data can be transferred remotely at the base station via the website. The advantage of using python in the programming makes the work on the Raspberry easier and faster, and the language learning becomes easier than before. The other advantage of this technique is to allow sending the data to any Raspberry by clicking special buttons on the GUI, capability to work with both multicast-and unicast-based communication schemes, and to work as router and end tag(E52) to enable sending the real-time data to the nearest router. Analytically, the new design provides a maximum transmit power of 20 dBm12 compared to 18 dBs and increase the output power increases by a little more than 2 dB.","[Hasan, Saja Zaid] Minist Elect, Informat Technol Ctr, Baghdad, Iraq; [Sharqi, Sajjad Hasan] Minist Elect, Planning & Studies Off, Baghdad, Iraq; [Gaaz, Tayser Sumer] Al Furat Al Awsat Tech Univ, Tech Coll Al Musaib, Babil, Iraq; [Al-Amiery, Ahmed A.] Univ Technol Baghdad, Energy & Renewable Energies Technol Ctr, Baghdad, Iraq",Al-Furat Al-Awsat Technical University; University of Technology- Iraq,"Gaaz, TS (corresponding author), Al Furat Al Awsat Tech Univ, Tech Coll Al Musaib, Babil, Iraq.",taysersumer@atu.edu.iq,"Al-Amiery, Ahmed/C-1520-2013","Al-Amiery, Ahmed/0000-0003-1033-4904",,,,,29,0,0,0,2,TAYLORS UNIV SDN BHD,SELANGOR,"1 JALAN SS15-8, SUBANG JAYA, SELANGOR, 47500, MALAYSIA",,1823-4690,,J ENG SCI TECHNOL,J.

The development of commercial devices has thus far focused on the quality of measurements and their robustness in all field cases. However, both their costs and lack of flexibility to adapt to specific applications have limited their prevalence in the environmental sector. This article presents the development of a low-cost, open hardware resistivity meter to provide the scientific community with a robust and flexible tool for small-scale experiments. Called OhmPi, this basic resistivity meter features current injection and measurement functions associated with a multiplexer that allows performing automatic measurements with up to 32 electrodes (at a cost of less than $500). The device was first tested using a soil-analog electrical circuit to verify the reliability and robustness of the measurements. Results show that OhmPi offers a wide range of resistance measurements, from 0.2 to 1000 O, for contact resistances between 100 and 5000 O. Measurements were then carried out on a small field experiment, in demonstrating good stability of the OhmPi measurements, as well as a strong correlation with the output of a commercial reference instrument.

The characteristic concern that educationalists in Moroccan universities have to reconsider in this pandemic period should not be beyond rethinking new pedagogical alternatives including approaches, methods, techniques and didactic materials which can successfully assist practioners of the teaching and learning process to keep up with the current alterations. Practical work (PW) is an indispensable type of teaching in scientific and technical training and meets a real complementary need through real, remote or virtual laboratories. Students can consolidate what they have learnt and develop analytical skills by comparing experimental results with those obtained during the manipulation. In this context, the Laboratory of Engineering Sciences and Energy Management (LASIME) at the Superior School of Technology of Agadir has developed a low-cost platform called LABERSIME installed in the cloud (LMS, IDE) and equipped with an embedded system to drive real laboratory equipment and perform experiments qualitatively more efficient than those in face-to-face mode.

To offer more tradeoff, we can integrate statically scheduled micro-architecture and use dynamic binary translation (DBT) for task migration. However, in a system where performance and energy consumption are a prime concern, the translation overhead has to be kept as low as possible. In this paper, we present Hybrid-DBT, an open-source, hardware accelerated DBT system targeting VLIW cores. Three different hardware accelerators have been designed to speed-up critical steps of the translation process. Experimental study shows that the accelerated steps are two orders of magnitude faster than their software equivalent.

In addition, parametric modeling is encouraged in order to facilitate customization for other experiments. Parametric design using a solid modeling programming language allows customization and provides a source file for the design. OpenSCAD is the most widely used scripting tool for parametric modeling of open source labware. However, OpenSCAD lacks the ability to export to standard parametric formats; thus, the parametric dimensional information of the model is lost. This is an important deficiency because it is key to share the design in the most accessible formats with no information loss. In this work we analyze OpenSCAD and compare it with FreeCAD Python scripts. We have created a parametric open source hardware design to compare these tools. Our findings show that although Python for FreeCAD is more arduous to learn, its advantages counterbalance the initial difficulties. The main benefits are being able to export to standard parametric models; using Python language with its libraries; and the ability to use and integrate the models in its graphical interface. Thus, making it more appropriate to design open source hardware for scientific equipment.","[Machado, Felipe; Malpica, Norberto; Borromeo, Susana] Univ Rey Juan Carlos, Area Elect Technol, Mostoles, Spain",Universidad Rey Juan Carlos,"Machado, F (corresponding author), Univ Rey Juan Carlos, Area Elect Technol, Mostoles, Spain.",felipe.machado@urjc.es,"Machado, Felipe/N-5051-2018; Borromeo, Susana/K-5376-2012; Malpica, Norberto/I-2090-2015","Machado, Felipe/0000-0001-7674-0943; Borromeo, Susana/0000-0002-2353-2902; Malpica, Norberto/0000-0003-4618-7459","Spanish Department of Economy and Competitiveness [RTC-2015-4167-1]; Spanish Department of Science, Innovation and Universities [RTC-2017-62181]","Spanish Department of Economy and Competitiveness; Spanish Department of Science, Innovation and Universities","N.M. and S.B. were supported by Spanish Department of Economy and Competitiveness grant RTC-2015-4167-1 (http://www.mineco.gob.es/; this department changed its name); and Spanish Department of Science, Innovation and Universities grant RTC-2017-62181 (http://www.ciencia.gob.es/).The funders had no role in study design, data collection and analysis, decision to publish, or preparation of the manuscript.",,41,21,21,6,15,PUBLIC LIBRARY SCIENCE,SAN FRANCISCO,"1160 BATTERY STREET, STE 100, SAN FRANCISCO, CA 94111 USA",1932-6203,,,PLOS ONE,PLoS One,Dec 5,2019,14,12,,,,,,,e0225795,10.1371/journal.pone.0225795,http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0225795,,,30,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Science & Technology - Other Topics,LP0JY,31805116.0,"Green Published, gold",,,2024-08-15,WOS:000534009700060,,,,157

The increasing complexity of the control and estimation algorithms requires deeper functional testing and validation phases of BMSs. However, the use of real batteries in such phases leads to hazards and safety risks. Battery emulators and the Hardware-in-the-Loop approach can instead speed-up and increase the safety of the functional testing and algorithm validation phases. This work describes the design and the characterization of a low-cost modular multi-cell battery emulator which provides a complete emulation of cell voltage, temperature, and current. This platform can be used to carry out Hardware-in-the-Loop tests on custom and commercial Battery Management Systems. The paper describes the platform design constraints derived from the most diffused Battery Management System architectures, the main design and implementation choices, and the platform characterization results. The proposed emulation platform is compared with literature and commercial ones showing a very good trade-off between performance and cost. This characteristic makes it appealing for small-size laboratories that develop and test Battery Management Systems.

Energy harvesting has emerged as a promising approach to delivering long-life, environmentally friendly IoT device operation. However, with the exception of solar harvesting, it remains difficult to ensure sustainable system operation using environmental power alone.

However, the algorithms and applications that need to be accelerated are evolving at a rate that is incompatible with manual design processes based on hardware description languages. Agile hardware design tools based on compiler techniques can help by quickly producing an application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) accelerator starting from a high-level algorithmic description. We present the software-defined accelerator (SODA) synthesizer, a modular and open-source hardware compiler that provides automated end-to-end synthesis from high-level software frameworks to ASIC implementation, relying on multilevel representations to progressively lower and optimize the input code. Our approach does not require the application developer to write any register-transfer level code, and it is able to reach up to 364 giga floating point operations per second (GFLOPS)/W efficiency (32-bit precision) on typical convolutional neural network operators.","[Agostini, Nicolas Bohm; Curzel, Serena; Limaye, Ankur; Castellana, Vito Giovanni; Manzano, Joseph; Tumeo, Antonino] Pacific Northwest Natl Lab, High Performance Comp Grp, Richland, WA 99354 USA; [Amatya, Vinay] Pacific Northwest Natl Lab, Richland, WA 99354 USA; [Minutoli, Marco] Pacific Northwest Natl Lab, Data Sci & Machine Intelligence Grp, Richland, WA 99354 USA; [Zhang, Jeff (Jun)] Harvard Univ, Architecture Circuits & Compilers Grp, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Brooks, David] Harvard Univ, Sch Engn & Appl Sci, Comp Sci, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Wei, Gu-Yeon] Harvard Univ, John A Paulson Sch Engineer & Appl Sci, Elect Engn & Comp Sci, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Tan, Cheng] Microsoft, Redmond, WA USA",United States Department of Energy (DOE); Pacific Northwest National Laboratory; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Pacific Northwest National Laboratory; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Pacific Northwest National Laboratory; Harvard University; Harvard University; Harvard University; Microsoft,"Agostini, NB (corresponding author), Pacific Northwest Natl Lab, High Performance Comp Grp, Richland, WA 99354 USA.",nicolas.agostini@pnnl.gov; serena.curzel@polimi.it; jeffzhang@g.harvard.edu; ankur.limaye@pnnl.gov; chengtan@microsoft.com; Vinay.amatya@pnnl.gov; marco.minutoli@pnnl.gov; vitogiovanni.castellana@pnnl.gov; joseph.manzano@pnnl.gov; dbrooks@g.harvard.edu; guyeon@seas.harvard.edu; antonino.tumeo@pnnl.gov,"Curzel, Serena/AHD-0907-2022; Limaye, Ankur/AAM-4823-2021; Manzano, Joseph/M-6850-2014","Curzel, Serena/0000-0002-8202-1627; Limaye, Ankur/0000-0001-9406-2584; Bohm Agostini, Nicolas/0000-0003-1855-3810; Manzano, Joseph/0000-0002-6616-0125; Minutoli, Marco/0000-0002-4220-1420",,,,,15,8,8,0,3,IEEE COMPUTER SOC,LOS ALAMITOS,"10662 LOS VAQUEROS CIRCLE, PO BOX 3014, LOS ALAMITOS, CA 90720-1314 USA",0272-1732,1937-4143,,IEEE MICRO,IEEE Micro,SEPT 1,2022,42,5,,,,,78,88,,10.1109/MM.2022.3178580,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/MM.2022.3178580,,,11,"Computer Science, Hardware & Architecture; Computer Science, Software Engineering",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Computer Science,4O3EQ,,"Green Published, Green Submitted",,,2024-08-15,WOS:000854586200002,,,,162

A case study is presented where the platform is developed to provide both the colorimetry for biochemical oxygen demand/chemical oxygen demand and nephelometry to measure turbidity using method ISO 7027.

A threat plaguing these systems consists of software vulnerabilities that cause memory corruption, potentially allowing an attacker to breach the device. Software-based countermeasures exist, but suffer from high overhead. In this survey, we investigate whether this could be mitigated using dedicated hardware. Driven by the advancements of open hardware, we focus on implementations for RISC-V, a novel and open architecture tailored for customization. We distinguish between methods validating memory accesses beforehand, obfuscating information necessary for an attack, and detecting memory values corrupted earlier. We compare on qualitative metrics, such as the security coverage and level of transparency, and performance in both software and hardware. Although current implementations do not easily allow for a fair comparison as their evaluation methodologies vary widely, we show that current implementations are suitable to minimize the runtime overhead with a relatively small area overhead. Nevertheless, we identified that further research is still required to mitigate more fine-grained attacks such as intra-object overflows, to integrate into more sophisticated protected execution environments towards resilient systems that are automatically recoverable, and to move towards more harmonized evaluation.","[Brohet, Marco; Regazzoni, Francesco] Univ Amsterdam, Sci Pk 900, NL-1098 XH Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Regazzoni, Francesco] Univ Svizzera Italiana, ALaRi, Via Santa 1, CH-6962 Lugano, Switzerland",University of Amsterdam; Universita della Svizzera Italiana,"Brohet, M (corresponding author), Univ Amsterdam, Sci Pk 900, NL-1098 XH Amsterdam, Netherlands.",m.j.a.brohet@uva.nl; f.regazzoni@uva.nl,,"Brohet, M.J.A./0000-0002-0860-9107; Regazzoni, Francesco/0000-0001-6385-0780",,,,,83,0,0,2,2,ASSOC COMPUTING MACHINERY,NEW YORK,"1601 Broadway, 10th Floor, NEW YORK, NY USA",0360-0300,1557-7341,,ACM COMPUT SURV,ACM Comput.

Currently, WSNs provide data in different formats. There is a lack of communication protocol standardization, which turns into interoperability issues when connecting different sensor networks or even when connecting different sensor nodes within the same network. This work presents a sensorized platform proposal that adheres to the principles of the Internet of Things and the Web of Things. Wireless sensor nodes were built using open hardware solutions, and communications rely on the HTTP/IP Internet protocols. The Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) SensorThings API candidate standard was used as a neutral format to avoid interoperability issues. An environmental WSN developed following the proposed architecture was built as a proof of concept. Details on how to build each node and a study regarding energy concerns are presented.","[Trilles, Sergio; Lujan, Alejandro; Belmonte, Oscar; Montoliu, Raul; Torres-Sospedra, Joaquin; Huerta, Joaquin] Univ Jaume 1, Inst New Imaging Technol, Castellon De La Plana 12071, Spain",Universitat Jaume I,"Trilles, S (corresponding author), Univ Jaume 1, Inst New Imaging Technol, Ave Vicente Sos Baynat S-N, Castellon De La Plana 12071, Spain.",strilles@uji.es; alujan@uji.es; belfern@uji.es; montoliu@uji.es; jtorres@uji.es; huerta@uji.es,"Trilles, Sergio/AAB-1339-2019; Torres-Sospedra, Joaquín/G-4885-2013; Huerta, Joaquin/L-6103-2018","Trilles, Sergio/0000-0002-9304-0719; Torres-Sospedra, Joaquín/0000-0003-4338-4334; Huerta, Joaquin/0000-0002-8625-441X; Belmonte-Fernandez, Oscar/0000-0002-0121-0697; Montoliu Colas, Raul/0000-0002-8467-391X",Generalitat Valenciana [ACIF/2012/112],Generalitat Valenciana(Center for Forestry Research & Experimentation (CIEF)),The authors acknowledge the received support by Steve Liang's team for the server contribution with the development of the OGC SensorThings API.

One of the most promising solutions that couple the flexibility of a processor with the performance and efficiency of an accelerator is the vector processor architecture. Since RISC-V has only recently frozen its vector ISA extension, no open-source RISC-V-based vector processor has been fabricated and characterized. This brief presents the Yun SoC, featuring the first implementation of an open-source RISC-V-based vector processor in TSMC's 65-nm technology. Our efficient 4-lane design achieves almost peak theoretical performance on large matrix multiplication problems with an FPU utilization of almost 90%. Yun, with a critical path of 30 FO4 inverter delays, achieves a peak performance of 2.83 GFLOPSDP (at 400 MHz and 1.5 V), a leading-edge area efficiency of 3 GFLOPSP/cycle/MGE, and a peak energy efficiency of 10.8 GFLOPSDP (at 100 MHz and 0.85 V).

This review explores the applications of Raspberry Pi in microfluidics, with a focus on imaging, including microscopy and automated image capture. By leveraging the low cost, flexibility and accessibility of Raspberry Pi components, high-resolution imaging and analysis have been achieved in direct mammalian and bacterial cellular imaging and a plethora of image-based biochemical and molecular assays, from immunoassays, through microbial growth, to nucleic acid methods such as real-time-qPCR. The control of image capture permitted by Raspberry Pi hardware can also be combined with onboard image analysis. Open-source hardware offers an opportunity to develop complex laboratory instrumentation systems at a fraction of the cost of commercial equipment and, importantly, offers an opportunity for complete customisation to meet the users' needs. However, these benefits come with a trade-off: challenges remain for those wishing to incorporate open-source hardware equipment in their own work, including requirements for construction and operator skill, the need for good documentation and the availability of rapid prototyping such as 3D printing plus other components. These advances in open-source hardware have the potential to improve the efficiency, accessibility, and cost-effectiveness of microfluidic-based experiments and applications.","[Sariyer, Rueya Meltem; Needs, Sarah Helen] Univ Reading, Sch Pharm, Reading RG6 6DX, England; [Edwards, Alexander Daniel] Univ Southampton, Sch Elect & Comp Sci, Southampton SO17 1BJ, England",University of Reading; University of Southampton,"Needs, SH (corresponding author), Univ Reading, Sch Pharm, Reading RG6 6DX, England.; Edwards, AD (corresponding author), Univ Southampton, Sch Elect & Comp Sci, Southampton SO17 1BJ, England.",r.sariyer@pgr.reading.ac.uk; a.d.edwards@soton.ac.uk; s.h.needs@reading.ac.uk,"Sarıyer, Rüya Meltem/GON-8554-2022; Edwards, Alexander Daniel/AAX-8524-2021","Sarıyer, Rüya Meltem/0000-0002-2155-653X; Edwards, Alexander Daniel/0000-0003-2369-989X; Needs, Sarah/0000-0003-3407-9637","Turkish Ministry of National Education, Republic of Tuerkiye; National Institute for Health and Care Research (NIHR) [NIHR203362]; National Institutes of Health Research (NIHR) [NIHR203362] Funding Source: National Institutes of Health Research (NIHR)","Turkish Ministry of National Education, Republic of Tuerkiye; National Institute for Health and Care Research (NIHR)(National Institutes of Health Research (NIHR)); National Institutes of Health Research (NIHR)(National Institutes of Health Research (NIHR))","This research was was supported by the Turkish Ministry of National Education, Republic of Tuerkiye for Postgraduate Study Abroad Program to support Rueya Meltem Sariyer, and the National Institute for Health and Care Research (NIHR) under its Invention for Innovation (i4i) Programme (Grant Reference Number NIHR203362).

Microalgae cultivation techniques have evolved and improved, but a vast amount of research is still needed to achieve a better understanding of these microorganisms. Due to this, there is a growing need for affordable, flexible, and easy to control research systems and protocols. 3D printing revolutionized design and manufacturing as it became widely available to the mass market, allowing the creation of novel forms, enabling mass customization, and supporting low-volume, distributed production. The emergence of open source designs combined with 3D printing applications have the potential to replace and outperform standard designs and methods. This protocol describes CultureLED, a well plated cell culture system that can be mounted on an orbital shaker or positioned on a shelf. It is an open hardware design, based on low-cost commercial off-the-shelf components. It was designed for optimized production cost, simplicity, low power consumption, design flexibility, and controllable light conditions. The CultureLED utilizes light-emitting diodes and it can be used for cultivation of small sized organisms or microorganisms with different light requirements and as such, has a wide range of applications.(c) 2022 The Authors.

Lack of reliable quality management tools has impeded repository development in the past several decades. Microfabricated open-hardware devices have emerged as a new approach to assist repository development by providing standardized quality assessment capabilities to enable routine quality control. However, prototyping of microfabricated devices (microdevices) traditionally relies on photolithography techniques that are costly, time intensive, and accessible only through specialized engineering laboratories. Although resin 3-D printing has been introduced into the microfabrication domain, existing publications focus on customized or high-cost (>thousands of USD) printers. The goal of this report was to identify and call attention to the emerging opportunities to support innovation in microfabrication by use of low-cost (<USD 350) resin 3-D printing for rapid prototyping. We demonstrate that low-cost mask-based stereolithography (MSLA) 3-D printers with straightforward modifications can provide fabrication quality that approaches traditional photolithography techniques. For example, reliable feature sizes of 20 <mu>m with dimensional discrepancy of <4% for lateral dimensions and <5% for vertical dimensions were fabricated with a consumer-level MSLA printers. In addition, alterations made to pre-processing, post-processing, and printer configuration steps improved print quality as demonstrated in objects with sharper edges and smoother surfaces. The prototyping time and cost of resin 3-D printing (3 h with USD 0.5/prototype) were considerably lower than those of traditional photolithography (5 d with USD 80/prototype). With the rapid advance of consumer-grade printers, resin 3-D printing can revolutionize rapid prototyping approaches for microdevices in the near future, facilitating participation in interdisciplinary development of innovative hardware to support germplasm repository development for aquatic species.","[Zuchowicz, Nikolas C.; Liu, Yue; Tiersch, Terrence R.] Louisiana State Univ, Agr Ctr, Sch Renewable Nat Resources, Aquatic Germplasm & Genet Resources Ctr, Baton Rouge, LA 70820 USA; [Belgodere, Jorge A.; Liu, Yue; Monroe, William Todd] Louisiana State Univ, Agr Ctr, Dept Biol & Agr Engn, Baton Rouge, LA 70803 USA; [Belgodere, Jorge A.; Semmes, Ignatius; Monroe, William Todd] Louisiana State Univ, Dept Biol & Agr Engn, Baton Rouge, LA 70803 USA",Louisiana State University System; Louisiana State University; Louisiana State University System; Louisiana State University; Louisiana State University System; Louisiana State University,"Tiersch, TR (corresponding author), Louisiana State Univ, Agr Ctr, Sch Renewable Nat Resources, Aquatic Germplasm & Genet Resources Ctr, Baton Rouge, LA 70820 USA.",nzucho1@lsu.edu; jbelgo1@lsu.edu; yliu@agcenter.lsu.edu; isemme1@lsu.edu; tmonroe@lsu.edu; ttiersch@agcenter.lsu.edu,,"Liu, Yue/0000-0003-3838-8277; Zuchowicz, Nikolas/0000-0002-3577-0190; Belgodere, Jorge/0000-0003-3399-4796","National Institutes of Health, Office of Research Infrastructure Programs [R24-OD010441, R24-OD028443]; National Institute of Food and Agriculture, United States Department of Agriculture [LAB94420, NC1194]; Louisiana State University Research & Technology Foundation [AG-2018-LIFT-003]; LSU-ACRES (Audubon Center for Research of Endangered Species) Collaborative Program; Paul M.

The regression models developed by re-searchers to predict physicochemical attributes using spectra remain theoretical due to lack of mechanism to integrate the developed models back into proprietary devices. This poses challenge for commercial adaptation of this technology in commercial food quality supply chain. The present study addresses this research gap by presenting first of its kind innovative approach to classify tomatoes based on lycopene content using chemometrics-machine learning framework driven portable short-wave near infra-red (SWNIR) spectropho-tometer developed by integration of open-source hardware (AS7265x multispectral chipset having wavelength range 410-940 nanometre (nm), Arduino Uno microcontroller) and software (R platform), housed in ergo-nomically designed and 3-dimension printed cabinet ensuring noise-free spectra acquisition. The lycopene content was observed to have strong negative correlation with wavelengths (nm) 485, 560 and 585 at rho = - 0.65, - 0.70, - 0.70, whereas strong positive correlation with 760 nm at rho = +0.64. Similar associations were qual-itatively observed using principal component analysis. Atypical of literature, feature selection was performed based on analysis of variance and 14 wavelengths which exhibited statistically significant difference with respect to 15-days storage study (p <= 0.05) were selected for model development. Chemometrics-machine learning framework was used for development of optimised probabilistic and non-probabilistic models including logistic regression, Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), Random Forest (RF), Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) models using 10-fold cross validation subjected to 80-20% train-test split of the dataset. In agreement with literature, 500-750 nm wavelength range dominated the classification of lycopene content. Notably, specific wavelengths for logistic regression (560 nm), LDA (730 nm, 645 nm, 560 nm, 535 nm), RF (760 nm, 585 nm, 560 nm, 645 nm), and ANN (585 nm, 560 nm) significantly influenced outcome instances across classifiers. Accuracy obtained from confusion matrix on test dataset was used as performance metric to compare different models. Logistic regression and RF showcased accuracy of 80%, LDA and SVM at 90% while ANN outperformed all models with accuracy of 95%. This study successfully augmented technological advancement in field of spectroscopy for non-invasive quality assessment of fruit. It is recommended to conduct similar studies on other climacteric fruits for wider adoption of this technology.","[Sharma, Arun; Kumar, Ritesh] CSIR Cent Sci Instruments Org, Sect 30, Chandigarh 160030, India; [Sharma, Arun; Kumar, Ritesh] Acad Sci & Innovat Res AcSIR, Ghaziabad 201002, India; [Sharma, Arun; Kumar, Nishant; Saxena, Vikas] Natl Inst Food Technol Entrepreneurship & Manageme, Sonipat 131028, Haryana, India",Council of Scientific & Industrial Research (CSIR) - India; CSIR - Central Scientific Instruments Organisation (CSIO); Academy of Scientific & Innovative Research (AcSIR),"Sharma, A (corresponding author), Natl Inst Food Technol Entrepreneurship & Manageme, Sonipat 131028, Haryana, India.",arun.sharma@niftem.ac.in,"Kumar, Nishant/AAW-7613-2021; Kumar, Nishant/K-9395-2018","Kumar, Nishant/0000-0003-0124-9337; Sharma, Arun/0000-0002-0460-3939; Kumar, Nishant/0000-0003-0187-7544",,,,,78,1,1,7,8,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0924-2031,1873-3697,,VIB SPECTROSC,Vib.

After the toilet usage, the circular lid can be brought back to the initial seating using a lever mechanism and a spring-loaded lock restrains its downward movement. Thereafter, it can be used as an ordinary WC for indoor applications. Moreover, a small wheel with 22 in diameter and removable hand-rests ensured the transferability between utilities. A CAD model is prepared and numerical simulation is performed to verify the structural stability of the design. Results The optimized model is fabricated using standard manufacturing practices and is delivered to different persons with disabilities to collect user feedback. A systematic skill test is conducted to validate the compliance of the prototype with the user requirements including transferability and independent restroom access. Conclusion The opinions from most of the users are positive which categorically indicated that the proposed design addresses the multipurpose mobility requirements at indoors.","[Akhil, J.

Dynamic adaptivity arises when stimulation targets dynamically changing states, which often calls for a reliable and fast causal estimation of the phase and amplitude of the signals. Here, we present an open-hardware implementation that exploits the concepts of resonators and Hilbert filters embedded in an open-hardware platform. To emulate real-world scenarios, we built a hardware setup that included a system to replay and process different types of physiological signals and test the accuracy of the instantaneous phase and amplitude estimates. The results show that the system can provide a precise and reliable estimation of the phase even in the challenging scenario of dealing with high-frequency oscillations (similar to 250 Hz) in real-time. The framework might be adopted in neuromodulation studies to quickly test biomarkers in clinical and preclinical settings, supporting the advancement of aDBS.","[Ochoa, Jose angel; Gonzalez-Burgos, Irene; Nicolas, Maria Jesus; Valencia, Miguel] Univ Navarra, Biomed Engn Program, Physiol Monitoring & Control Lab, CIMA, Avda Pio 12 55, Pamplona 31080, Spain; [Ochoa, Jose angel; Gonzalez-Burgos, Irene; Nicolas, Maria Jesus; Valencia, Miguel] Navarra Inst Hlth Res, IdiSNA, C Irunlarrea, Pamplona 31008, Spain; [Valencia, Miguel] Univ Navarra, Inst Data Sci & Artificial Intelligence, Pamplona 31009, Spain",University of Navarra; University of Navarra,"Valencia, M (corresponding author), Univ Navarra, Biomed Engn Program, Physiol Monitoring & Control Lab, CIMA, Avda Pio 12 55, Pamplona 31080, Spain.; Valencia, M (corresponding author), Navarra Inst Hlth Res, IdiSNA, C Irunlarrea, Pamplona 31008, Spain.; Valencia, M (corresponding author), Univ Navarra, Inst Data Sci & Artificial Intelligence, Pamplona 31009, Spain.",jochoamarti@unav.es; igonzalezb@unav.es; mnicolas@unav.es; mvustarroz@unav.es,"Valencia, Miguel/C-3055-2009","Valencia, Miguel/0000-0001-5617-5270","Departamento de Salud, Gobierno de Navarra","Departamento de Salud, Gobierno de Navarra",The authors would like to thank J.

For bringing this technology to AEC classrooms, an open-source TLS was developed. The physical model was built using digital fabrication, its connectivity was established using accessible, affordable, open-source sensors and actuators and its digital representation was developed using generative design tools. All elements together are synchronized in real-time and the TLS becomes live, digitally twinned, geometry generator. The points that are generated by the TLS are gathered in a 3D virtual space in the form of virtual points. The present digitally twinned vision of laser scanning has thus three identified educational uses: (i) illustration of the measuring principle using open-source hardware together with mathematics and statistics, (ii) illustration of the generation and visualization of point clouds in real-time within a CAD environment, and (iii) perhaps with a vaster scope in AEC classrooms, illustration of the usage, analysis and identification of these point clouds. The development of this tool belongs to a vaster project for infusing Construction 4.0 technologies in AEC classrooms under development in xxxxxxxxxxxxx. The illustration to students of all these concepts with accessible technological tools is expected to enlarge their vision of more advanced constructional technologies such as cyber-physical systems for monitoring and surveying as well as digital technologies for reproducing ""As-Built"" models.","[Ramonell, Carlos; Chacon, Rolando] Univ Politecn Cataluna, Sch Civil Engn, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, C Jordi Girona 1-3,Campus Nord UPC,Bldg C1, Barcelona 08034, Spain",Universitat Politecnica de Catalunya,"Chacón, R (corresponding author), Univ Politecn Cataluna, Sch Civil Engn, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, C Jordi Girona 1-3,Campus Nord UPC,Bldg C1, Barcelona 08034, Spain.",,"Chacon, Rolando/K-4755-2015","Chacon, Rolando/0000-0002-7259-5635",European Commission [958161]; Institut de Ciencies de la Educacio.

They are seen as a key to advancements in such fields. A robotic is being used to assure precision and reliability. Some bigger companies like amazon use robotics to achieve stability and speed up their productions. In real-life, robots are mostly used in environments that contain uncertainties events. Additionally, interruptions occur there. Determining several performance quantities such as the execution time, throughput, power dissipation and energy under severe circumstances is crucial in the fields where robotics are used. This paper uses the developed framework earlier on a robotic manipulator to estimate average power dissipation, also known as power consumption, and average energy. Subsequently, a comparison analysis is conducted using several free tools such as Power Gadget, HW Monitor, Sidebar Diagnostics and Open Hardware Monitor. Those free tools are chosen since they are available with no extra hidden charges, and they are easy to download and use. The aim of that analysis is to find the differences between the average estimated value using mathematical equations and the actual ones from those tools. The analysis is performed on a machine running on a Windows based system. The results that obtained indicate that the estimated/predicted values of the dissipated power and energy are close to the actual values. Likewise, the error between those figures varies between 6% to 11%. This variation happens because the used machine is affected by its specifications, especially the number of cores of its CPU and the clock frequency.","[Alsheikhy, Ahmed] Northern Border Univ, Coll Engn, Dept Elect Engn, Ar Ar, Saudi Arabia",Northern Border University,"Alsheikhy, A (corresponding author), Northern Border Univ, Coll Engn, Dept Elect Engn, Ar Ar, Saudi Arabia.",aalsheikhy@nbu.edu.sa,"Alsheikhy, Ahmed/AAJ-7904-2021","Alsheikhy, Ahmed/0000-0002-9811-0341",,,,,17,1,1,0,0,UNION SCIENTISTS BULGARIA,SOFIA,"1505 SOFIA 39, MADRID BLVD, FLR 2, SOFIA, 00000, BULGARIA",1313-8251,,,INT J INF TECHNOL SE,Int.

However, published results usually focus on the experiment, disregarding technical details of the scientific equipment. Lacking enough information about these custom devices prevents their accurate replication, hindering the experiment reproducibility, which is a fundamental requirement for Open Science. In the field of Geology, custom electromechanical devices with low-speed moving elements are required to analyze scaled-down models of the tectonic deformation processes. In these experiments, the earth crust is modeled with materials whose properties and setup are scrupulously specified to comply with the scale model theory and to have standard and reproducible procedures. Notwithstanding this rigorous characterization, we believe that the moving apparatus has received little attention, implicitly assuming an ideal behavior despite the difficulties of moving uniformly at such slow speeds, which could produce disparities with the natural model. In this paper we address this issue by presenting a device for scientific analogue modeling of contractional and extensional tectonics. We analyze the challenges and implications of moving at such low speeds, demonstrate its satisfactory performance and provide suggestions for improvement. In addition, the proposed apparatus is not only affordable and relatively easy to build, but also is an open-hardware project that can be replicated, improved or customized, even in other research fields. We hope that this contribution will be beneficial for the scientific and educational community, facilitating the reliability of experiments, the exchange of ideas, and thereby the promotion of Open Science.","[Machado, Felipe; Nieto, Ruben; Fernandez-Garcia, Cristina; Borromeo, Susana] Univ Rey Juan Carlos, Area Elect Technol, Mostoles 28933, Spain; [Machado, Felipe] Univ Las Palmas Gran Canaria, Inst Appl Microelect, Las Palmas Gran Canaria 35017, Spain; [Ramos, Marta Rincon; Gonzalez-Munoz, Sandra; Martin-Gonzalez, Fidel] Univ Rey Juan Carlos, Escuela Super Ciencias Expt & Tecnol ESCET, Area Geol, Tecvolrisk Res Grp, Mostoles 28933, Spain",Universidad Rey Juan Carlos; Universidad de Las Palmas de Gran Canaria; Universidad Rey Juan Carlos,"Borromeo, S (corresponding author), Univ Rey Juan Carlos, Area Elect Technol, Mostoles 28933, Spain.",susana.borromeo@urjc.es,"Nieto, Rubén/ACO-5821-2022; Machado, Felipe/N-5051-2018; Martin-Gonzalez, Fidel/G-3235-2015","Nieto, Rubén/0000-0002-8293-9665; Machado, Felipe/0000-0001-7674-0943; Rincon, Marta/0000-0003-3469-9190; Fernandez Garcia, Cristina/0000-0003-0735-4170; Borromeo, Susana/0000-0002-2353-2902; Martin-Gonzalez, Fidel/0000-0002-5239-1846; Gonzalez Munoz, Sandra/0000-0001-8985-5088",,,,,70,0,0,0,1,IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC,PISCATAWAY,"445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA",2169-3536,,,IEEE ACCESS,IEEE Access,,2023,11,,,,,,31716,31746,,10.1109/ACCESS.2023.3262617,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2023.3262617,,,31,"Computer Science, Information Systems; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Telecommunications",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Computer Science; Engineering; Telecommunications,D2VX4,,gold,,,2024-08-15,WOS:000967362900001,,,,185

Traditionally, the volume of such measurements has been limited by the high cost of commercially available instruments. An increasingly attractive solution to this cost issue is to use instruments produced in-house from open-source hardware, firmware, and postprocessing building blocks. In the present work, we release the next iteration of our open-source drifter and wave-monitoring instrument, which follows these solution aspects. The new design is significantly less expensive (typically by a factor of 5 compared with our previous, already cost-effective instrument), much easier to build and assemble for people without specific microelectronics and programming competence, more easily extendable and customizable, and two orders of magnitude more power-efficient (to the point where solar panels are no longer needed even for long-term deployments). Improving performance and reducing noise levels and costs compared with our previous generation of instruments is possible in large part thanks to progress from the electronics component industry. As a result, we believe that this will allow scientists in geosciences to increase by an order of magnitude the amount of in situ data they can collect under a constant instrumentation budget. In the following, we offer (1) a detailed overview of our hardware and software solution, (2) in situ validation and benchmarking of our instrument, (3) a fully open-source release of both hardware and software blueprints. We hope that this work, and the associated open-source release, will be a milestone that will allow our scientific fields to transition towards open-source, community-driven instrumentation. We believe that this could have a considerable impact on many fields by making in situ instrumentation at least an order of magnitude less expensive and more customizable than it has been for the last 50 years, marking the start of a new paradigm in oceanography and polar science, where instrumentation is an inexpensive commodity and in situ data are easier and less expensive to collect.","[Rabault, Jean; Hope, Gaute; Mueller, Malte; Breivik, Oyvind; Hole, Lars Robert; Bohlinger, Patrik; Christensen, Kai Haakon] Norwegian Meteorol Inst, N-0313 Oslo, Norway; [Nose, Takehiko; Waseda, Takuji; Kodaira, Tsubasa; Katsuno, Tomotaka] Univ Tokyo, Grad Sch Frontier Sci, Kashiwa, Chiba 2778561, Japan; [Mueller, Malte; Jensen, Atle; Gundersen, Olav] Univ Oslo, Dept Math, N-0313 Oslo, Norway; [Voermans, Joey; Babanin, Alexander] Univ Melbourne, Dept Infrastruct Engn, Parkville, Vic 3052, Australia; [Waseda, Takuji] Japan Agcy Marine Earth Sci & Technol, Yokosuka, Kanagawa 2370061, Japan; [Johnson, Mark] Univ Alaska Fairbanks, Coll Fisheries & Ocean Sci, Fairbanks, AK 99775 USA; [Sutherland, Graig] Environm Numer Predict Res, Environm Climate Change Canada, Dorval, PQ H9P 1J3, Canada; [Johansson, Malin] UiT Arctic Univ Norway, Dept Phys & Technol, N-9037 Tromso, Norway; [Garbo, Adam] Carleton Univ, Water & Ice Res Lab, Ottawa, ON K1S 5B6, Canada; [Marchenko, Aleksey] Univ Ctr Svalbard, Dept Arctic Technol, POB 156, N-9171 Longyearbyen, Norway",Norwegian Meteorological Institute; University of Tokyo; University of Oslo; University of Melbourne; Japan Agency for Marine-Earth Science & Technology (JAMSTEC); University of Alaska System; University of Alaska Fairbanks; Environment & Climate Change Canada; UiT The Arctic University of Tromso; Carleton University; University Centre Svalbard (UNIS),"Rabault, J (corresponding author), Norwegian Meteorol Inst, N-0313 Oslo, Norway.",jean.rblt@gmail.com; tak.nose@edu.k.u-tokyo.ac.jp; gauteh@met.no; maltem@met.no; oyvindb@met.no; jvoermans@unimelb.edu.au; lrh@met.no; patrikb@met.no; waseda@k.u-tokyo.ac.jp; kodaira@edu.k.u-tokyo.ac.jp; katsuno@s.otpe.k.u-tokyo.ac.jp; majohnson@alaska.edu; graigory.sutherland@canada.ca; malin.johansson@uit.no; kaihc@met.no; adamgarbo@cmail.carleton.ca; atlej@math.uio.no; olavgun@math.uio.no; alekseym@unis.no; a.babanin@unimelb.edu.au,"Marchenko, Aleksey/GSD-3516-2022; Waseda, Takuji/F-1445-2019; Muller, Malte/AAD-7692-2022","Marchenko, Aleksey/0000-0003-4169-0063; Muller, Malte/0000-0003-2871-8359; Johansson, Malin/0000-0003-0129-2239; Jensen, Atle/0000-0001-7376-0850; Christensen, Kai Hakon/0000-0002-5775-794X; Hole, Lars Robert/0000-0002-2246-9235; Babanin, Alexander/0000-0002-8595-8204; Garbo, Adam/0000-0002-7312-7390; Bohlinger, Patrik/0000-0002-7299-3676; Rabault, Jean/0000-0002-7244-6592; Waseda, Takuji/0000-0001-5403-5303","Research Council of Norway through ThinTEC [A321200]; Norwegian Polar Institute through ThinIce [66017]; ArCS II Japan-Russia-Canada International Exchange Program; Arctic Challenge for Sustainability II Project (ArCS II Project) [JPMXD1420318865]; JSPS KAKENHI [JP 19H00801, 19H05512, 21K14357]; DOFI Petromaks II project [28062]; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [20K20437, 21K14357] Funding Source: KAKEN","Research Council of Norway through ThinTEC(Research Council of Norway); Norwegian Polar Institute through ThinIce; ArCS II Japan-Russia-Canada International Exchange Program; Arctic Challenge for Sustainability II Project (ArCS II Project); JSPS KAKENHI(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI)); DOFI Petromaks II project; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))","This work was funded by the Research Council of Norway through ThinTEC (project number A321200), Norwegian Polar Institute through ThinIce (project number 66017); the ArCS II Japan-Russia-Canada International Exchange Program; the Arctic Challenge for Sustainability II Project (ArCS II Project, Program Grant Number JPMXD1420318865); the JSPS KAKENHI Grant Number JP 19H00801, 19H05512, and 21K14357; the DOFI Petromaks II project (funding to the University of Oslo, by the Research Council of Norway funding, grant number 28062).",,66,18,18,4,12,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2076-3263,,GEOSCIENCES,Geosciences,MAR,2022,12,3,,,,,,,110,10.3390/geosciences12030110,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/geosciences12030110,,,25,"Geosciences, Multidisciplinary",Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI),Geology,0E8TS,,"Green Submitted, Green Published, gold",,,2024-08-15,WOS:000776947500001,,,,187

The system monitors location (global positioning system), rider control data (level of assistance) and other custom sensor input in real time. The SEMS data feeds an online interface for data analysis, for riders to view their own data and for sharing on social media. The basic system can be replicated by other researchers and can be extended with modules to explore various issues in e-bike research. The source code and hardware design are publicly available, under the General Public License, for non-commercial use. SEMS was implemented on 30 bikes and collected data during 10 months of real-word trials in the UK.

Open-source hardware and software tools can allow researchers to design and build custom monitoring systems to sample organismal processes and the environment, systems that can be tailored to the particular needs of a research program.

We designed a position-independent differencing algorithm to robustly handle language constructs whose relative orderings do not matter. This paper presents Vdiff, an instantiation of this position-independent differencing algorithm for Verilog HDL. To help programmers reason about the differences at a high-level, Vdiff outputs syntactic differences in terms of Verilog-specific change types. The quantitative evaluation of Vdiff on two open source hardware design projects shows that Vdiff is very accurate, with overall 96.8 % precision and 97.3 % recall when using manually classified differences as a basis of comparison. Vdiff is also fast and scalable-it processes the entire revision history of nine open projects all under 5.35 minutes. We conducted a user study with eight hardware design experts to understand how the program differences identified by the experts match Vdiff's output. The study results show that Vdiff's output is better aligned with the experts' classification of Verilog changes than an existing textual program differencing tool.","[Kim, Miryung] Univ Texas Austin, Austin, TX 78712 USA; [Duley, Adam] ARM Inc, Austin, TX 78746 USA; [Spandikow, Chris] IBM Corp, Austin, TX 78758 USA",University of Texas System; University of Texas Austin; International Business Machines (IBM),"Kim, M (corresponding author), Univ Texas Austin, Austin, TX 78712 USA.",adam.duley@arm.com; spandiko@gmail.com; miryung@ece.utexas.edu,,,"National Science Foundation [CCF-1043810, CCF-1117902, CCF-1149391]; Microsoft SEIF Award; Direct For Computer & Info Scie & Enginr; Division of Computing and Communication Foundations [1043810] Funding Source: National Science Foundation; Division of Computing and Communication Foundations; Direct For Computer & Info Scie & Enginr [1117902, 1533791] Funding Source: National Science Foundation",National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Microsoft SEIF Award(Microsoft); Direct For Computer & Info Scie & Enginr; Division of Computing and Communication Foundations(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Computer & Information Science & Engineering (CISE)); Division of Computing and Communication Foundations; Direct For Computer & Info Scie & Enginr(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Computer & Information Science & Engineering (CISE)),"This research is in part supported by National Science Foundation grants under CCF-1043810, CCF-1117902, and CCF-1149391 and 2011 Microsoft SEIF Award.

Nowadays, IEQ monitoring systems are becoming important for several reasons: (1) to ensure that temperature and humidity conditions are adequate, improving the comfort and productivity of the occupants; (2) to introduce actions to reduce energy consumption, contributing to achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG); and (3) to guarantee the quality of the air-a key concern due to the COVID-19 worldwide pandemic. Two kinds of nodes compose the proposed architecture; these are the so-called: (1) smart IEQ sensor nodes, responsible for acquiring indoor environmental measures locally, and (2) the IEQ concentrators, responsible for collecting the data from smart sensor nodes distributed along the facilities. The IEQ concentrators are also responsible for configuring the acquisition system locally, logging the acquired local data, analyzing the information, and connecting to cloud applications. The presented architecture has been designed using low-cost open-source hardware and software-specifically, single board computers and microcontrollers such as Raspberry Pis and Arduino boards. WiFi and TCP/IP communication technologies were selected, since they are typically available in corporative buildings, benefiting from already available communication infrastructures. The application layer was implemented with MQTT. A prototype was built and deployed at the Faculty of Engineering of Vitoria-Gasteiz, University of the Basque Country (UPV/EHU), using the existing network infrastructure. This prototype allowed for collecting data within different academic scenarios.

One parameter to assess the water transparency is the diffuse attenuation coefficient. However, the number of subsurface irradiance measurements obtained with conventional instrumentation is relatively low, due to instrument costs and the logistic requirements to provide regular and autonomous observations. In recent years, the citizen science concept has increased the number of environmental observations, both in time and space. The recent technological advances in embedded systems and sensors also enable volunteers (citizens) to create their own devices (known as Do-It-Yourself or DIY technologies). In this paper, a DIY instrument to measure irradiance at different depths and automatically calculate the diffuse attenuation K-d coefficient is presented. The instrument, named KdUINO, is based on an encapsulated low-cost photonic sensor and Arduino (an open-hardware platform for the data acquisition). The whole instrument has been successfully operated and the data validated comparing the KdUINO measurements with the commercial instruments.

Drifters that can be tracked in real time have so far been rather expensive. Recently, due to the rise of the open-hardware revolution and the associated Arduino ecosystem, both GPS receivers and cellular modems have become available at lower prices to ""tinkering scientists"", i.e., scientists that like to build their own measurement devices as much as is possible. This article serves two goals. Firstly, we provide detailed instructions on how to build a low-power GPS drifter with local storage and cellular model that we tested in a fieldwork on the confluence of the Chindwin and Ayeyarwady rivers in Myanmar. The device was designed from easily connected off-the-shelf components, allowing construction without a background in electrical engineering. The instructions allow fellow geoscientists to recreate the device. Secondly, we set the following question: has the open-hardware revolution progressed to the point that a low-power GPS drifter that wirelessly transmits its position can be made from open-hardware components by most geoscientists?. We feel this question is relevant and timely as more low-cost open-hardware devices are promoted, but in practice applicability is often restricted to the ""tinkering engineer"". We argue that because of the plug-and-play nature of the components geoscientists should be able to construct these type of devices. However, to get such devices to operate at low power levels that fieldwork often demands requires detailed (micro)electrical expertise.","[Hut, Rolf] Delft Univ Technol, Fac Civil Engn & Geosci, Chair Water Resources Engn, NL-2628 CH Delft, Netherlands; [Win, Thanda Thatoe Nwe; Bogaard, Thom] Delft Univ Technol, Fac Civil Engn & Geosci, Chair Hydrol, NL-2628 CH Delft, Netherlands",Delft University of Technology; Delft University of Technology,"Hut, R (corresponding author), Delft Univ Technol, Fac Civil Engn & Geosci, Chair Water Resources Engn, NL-2628 CH Delft, Netherlands.",r.w.hut@tudelft.nl,"; Hut, Rolf/O-3344-2013","Bogaard, Thom/0000-0002-1325-024X; Hut, Rolf/0000-0002-5697-5697",[NICHE-NMR-250],,This research has been supported by VPDelta and NICHE-NMR-250 projects.,,22,1,1,0,2,COPERNICUS GESELLSCHAFT MBH,GOTTINGEN,"BAHNHOFSALLEE 1E, GOTTINGEN, 37081, GERMANY",2193-0856,2193-0864,,GEOSCI INSTRUM METH,Geosci.

It combines: (i) custom printed circuit boards (PCBs) with RFM69 frequency shift keying (FSK) radio frequency (RF) transceivers for wireless sensors, control nodes, and USB gateway, (ii) a Raspberry Pi 3B with custom firmware acting as either a centralized or distributed backhaul, and (iii) a custom dockerized application for the backend called Brood that serves as the director software managing message brokering via Message Queuing Telemetry Transport (MQTT) protocol using VerneMQ, database storage using InfluxDB, and data visualization using Grafana. The platform is built around the idea of a private, secure, and open technology for the built environment. Among its many applications, the platform allows occupants to investigate anomalies in energy usage, environmental quality, and thermal performance via a comprehensive dashboard with rich querying capabilities. It also includes multiple frontends to view and analyze building activity data, which can be used directly in building controls or to provide recommendations on how to increase operational efficiency or improve operating conditions. Here, we demonstrate three distinct applications of the Elemental platform, including: (1) deployment in a research lab for long-term data collection and automated analysis, (2) use as a full-home energy and environmental monitoring solution, and (3) fault and anomaly detection and diagnostics of individual building systems at the zone-level. Through these applications we demonstrate that the platform allows easy and virtually unlimited datalogging, monitoring, and analysis of real-time sensor data with low setup costs. Low-power sensor nodes placed in abundance in a building can also provide precise and immediate fault-detection, allowing for tuning equipment for more efficient operation and faster maintenance during the lifetime of the building.","[Ali, Akram Syed; Heidarinejad, Mohammad; Stephens, Brent] IIT, Dept Civil Architectural & Environm Engn, Chicago, IL 60616 USA; [Cote, Christopher] Entropealabs, Chicago, IL 60626 USA",Illinois Institute of Technology,"Ali, AS; Stephens, B (corresponding author), IIT, Dept Civil Architectural & Environm Engn, Chicago, IL 60616 USA.",aali21@hawk.iit.edu; chris@entropealabs.com; muh182@iit.edu; brent@iit.edu,,"Ali, Akram/0000-0003-0248-0493; Heidarinejad, Mohammad/0000-0002-3064-825X; Stephens, Brent/0000-0002-0177-6703",Franklin Energy; ASHRAE New Investigator Award,Franklin Energy; ASHRAE New Investigator Award,"This work was funded by Franklin Energy, by an ASHRAE New Investigator Award to Brent Stephens, and by an ASHRAE New Investigator Award to Mohammad Heidarinejad.",,49,35,37,6,34,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,1424-8220,,SENSORS-BASEL,Sensors,Sep 2,2019,19,18,,,,,,,4017,10.3390/s19184017,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/s19184017,,,20,"Chemistry, Analytical; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Instruments & Instrumentation",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Chemistry; Engineering; Instruments & Instrumentation,JC3OK,31540360.0,"gold, Green Published",,,2024-08-15,WOS:000489187800202,,,,194

Since its appearance more than 40 years ago, ICG has been used for assessing hemodynamic parameters. This paper presents a measurement system based on two System on Chip (SoC) solutions and Raspberry PI, implementing both a full three-lead ECG recorder and an impedance cardiographer, for educational and research development purposes. Raspberry PI is a platform supporting Do-I t-Yourself project and education applications across the world. The development is part of Biosignal PI, an open hardware platform focusing in quick prototyping of physiological measurement instrumentation. The SoC used for sensing cardiac biopotential is the ADAS1000, and for the EBI measurement is the AD5933. The recordings were wirelessly transmitted through Bluetooth to a PC, where the waveforms were displayed, and hemodynamic parameters such as heart rate, stroke volume, ejection time and cardiac output were extracted from the ICG and ECG recordings. These results show how Raspberry PI can be used for quick prototyping using relatively widely available and affordable components, for supporting developers in research and engineering education.

In this new scenario, advanced devices are needed for real-time monitoring and control of the energy flow and power quality (PQ). Ideally, the data collected by Internet of Thing (IoT) sensors should be shared to central cloud systems for online and off-line analysis. In this paper openZmeter (oZm) is presented as an advanced low-cost and open-source hardware device for high-precision energy and power quality measurement in low-voltage power systems. An analog front end (AFE) stage is designed and developed for the acquisition, conditioning, and processing of power signals. This AFE can be stacked on available quadcore embedded ARM boards. The proposed hardware is capable of adapting voltage signals up to 800 V AC/DC and currents up to thousands of amperes using different probes. The oZm device is described as a fully autonomous open-source system for the computation and visualization of PQ events and consumed/generated energy, along with full details of its hardware implementation. It also has the ability to send data to central cloud management systems. Given the small size of the hardware design and considering that it allows measurements under a wide range of operating conditions, oZm can be used both as bulk metering or as metering/submetering device for individual appliances. The design is released as open hardware and therefore is presented to the community as a powerful tool for general usage.","[Viciana, Eduardo; Alcayde, Alfredo; Montoya, Francisco G.; Banos, Raul; Arrabal-Campos, Francisco M.; Manzano-Agugliaro, Francisco] Univ Almeria, Dept Engn, Almeria 04120, Spain",Universidad de Almeria,"Montoya, FG (corresponding author), Univ Almeria, Dept Engn, Almeria 04120, Spain.",edu.vg82@gmail.com; aalcayde@ual.es; pagilm@ual.es; rbanos@ual.es; fmarrabal@ual.es; fmanzano@ual.es,"García, Alfredo Alcayde/R-8627-2018; Baños, Raúl/D-6433-2013; Manzano-Agugliaro, Francisco/K-8184-2014; Gil Montoya, Francisco/L-8067-2014; Arrabal Campos, Francisco Manuel/L-8544-2014","García, Alfredo Alcayde/0000-0002-2776-089X; Baños, Raúl/0000-0001-7844-4902; Manzano-Agugliaro, Francisco/0000-0002-0085-030X; Gil Montoya, Francisco/0000-0003-4105-565X; Arrabal Campos, Francisco Manuel/0000-0002-5510-6297; Viciana Gamez, Eduardo/0000-0001-9206-4105",Regional Government of Andalusia (ceiA3 project) at the University of Almeria,Regional Government of Andalusia (ceiA3 project) at the University of Almeria,This research was funded by the Regional Government of Andalusia (ceiA3 project) at the University of Almeria.,,49,39,39,1,11,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,1424-8220,,SENSORS-BASEL,Sensors,Feb 1,2019,19,3,,,,,,,627,10.3390/s19030627,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/s19030627,,,25,"Chemistry, Analytical; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Instruments & Instrumentation",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Chemistry; Engineering; Instruments & Instrumentation,HN1IR,30717225.0,"Green Published, gold, Green Submitted",,,2024-08-15,WOS:000459941200190,,,,196

Results: We developed a novel deep learning-based root extraction method that leverages the latest advances in convolutional neural networks for image segmentation and incorporates temporal consistency into the root system architecture reconstruction process. Automatic extraction of phenotypic parameters from sequences of images allowed a comprehensive characterization of the root system growth dynamics. Furthermore, novel time-associated parameters emerged from the analysis of spectral features derived from temporal signals.

This current practice of releasing water from reservoirs causes flash floods in downstream areas and increases the likelihood of dam failures and public outrage. Pre-release of water from reservoirs is therefore an important strategy for downstream flood mitigation. Hydrological models can simulate river flow with sufficient lead time. Thus, the resulting outputs can be effectively applied to pre-release decision making in the reservoirs. Since the beginning of computer-aided applications, many attempts have been made to establish a decision support system for reservoir flood control. However, this is hampered by manual stations, low quality data, high cost of software and data, unknown parameter values, and lack of expertise, especially in developing countries. Therefore, a total open-source solution combined with low-cost open-source hardware, free and open-source software, and open standards was seen as the only way to overcome reservoir-related flood risk. Moreover, research studies on open-source hardware, software, standards, and data are limited to a few case studies reporting real-time data on certain environmental parameters. Therefore, the application of integrated open-source technologies for reservoir flood control remains an unexplored area. In this background, a hydrological model powered by integrated open-source technology is presented in this research for reservoir pre-release decision making. The model was tested for the Deduru Oya watershed using the SWAT (Soil and Water Assessment Tool) toolkit. The calibration results appear to be satisfactory for both daily and hourly time intervals. Thus, this model helps to simulate the inflow of the reservoir and determine the level of reservoir gate opening.","[Warusavitharana, E.; Mahanama, P. K. S.; Ratnayake, R.; Sudantha, B.

Moreover, we present several design highlights on how to operate considering real open hardware and software products already available in the market.","[Puliafito, Antonio; Celesti, Antonio; Villari, Massimo; Fazio, Maria] Univ Messina, DICIEAMA, Contrada Dio, I-98166 Messina, Italy",University of Messina,"Celesti, A (corresponding author), Univ Messina, DICIEAMA, Contrada Dio, I-98166 Messina, Italy.",acelesti@unime.it,"Puliafito, Antonio/H-7823-2016","Puliafito, Antonio/0000-0003-0385-2711",European Unions Horizon Research and Innovation Programme project BEACON [644048]; H2020 - Industrial Leadership [644048] Funding Source: H2020 - Industrial Leadership,European Unions Horizon Research and Innovation Programme project BEACON; H2020 - Industrial Leadership(European Union (EU)H2020 - Industrial Leadership),This research was supported by the European Unions Horizon 2020 Research and Innovation Programme project BEACON under Grant Agreement no. 644048.,,19,5,5,0,5,HINDAWI LTD,LONDON,"ADAM HOUSE, 3RD FLR, 1 FITZROY SQ, LONDON, W1T 5HF, ENGLAND",1550-1329,1550-1477,,INT J DISTRIB SENS N,Int.

Microscopy techniques can be loosely divided into three main branches, namely photon-based optical microscopy, electron microscopy, and scanning probe microscopy with optical microscopy being the most prominent one. On the high-end level, optical microscopy nowadays enables nanometer resolution covering many scientific disciplines ranging from material sciences over the natural sciences and life sciences to the food sciences. On the lower-end level, simplified hardware and openly available description and blueprints have helped to make powerful microscopes widely available to interested scientists and researchers. For this special issue, we invited contributions from the community to share their latest ideas, designs, and research results on open-source hardware in microscopy. With this collection of articles, we hope to inspire the community to further increase the accessibility, interoperability, and reproducibility of microscopy. We further touch on the standardization of methodologies and devices including the use of computerized control of data acquisition and data analysis to achieve high quality and efficiency in research and development.","[Hohlbein, Johannes] Wageningen Univ & Res, Lab Biophys, Wageningen, Netherlands; [Hohlbein, Johannes] Wageningen Univ & Res, Microspect Res Facil, Wageningen, Netherlands; [Faez, Sanli] Univ Utrecht, Debye Inst Nanomat Res, Nanophoton, Utrecht, Netherlands",Wageningen University & Research; Wageningen University & Research; Utrecht University,"Hohlbein, J (corresponding author), Wageningen Univ & Res, Lab Biophys, Wageningen, Netherlands.; Hohlbein, J (corresponding author), Wageningen Univ & Res, Microspect Res Facil, Wageningen, Netherlands.",johannes.hohlbein@wur.nl; s.faez@uu.nl,,,,,,,33,1,1,2,3,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",,2468-0672,,HARDWAREX,HardwareX,SEP,2023,15,,,,,,,,e00473,10.1016/j.ohx.2023.e00473,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ohx.2023.e00473,,Sep 2023,4,"Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Instruments & Instrumentation; Materials Science, Multidisciplinary",Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI),Engineering; Instruments & Instrumentation; Materials Science,S5XJ3,37700785.0,Green Published,,,2024-08-15,WOS:001071889500001,,,,202

Algorithm development and functional testing are among the most complex and time-consuming phases of lithium-ion battery management system design. Furthermore, the use of real batteries in those phases introduces safety hazards. The hardware-in-the-loop approach allows the designers to overcome these limitations by replacing real batteries with hardware emulators. This article presents a low-cost battery emulator platform to reproduce the main electrical and thermal behaviors of elementary battery cells. The platform allows the user to manually control the emulator outputs or automatically reproduce specific voltage, temperature, and current profiles. In addition, the platform can independently reproduce the battery cell behaviors by using a customizable 2-RC equivalent electrical model. The functional testing and the balancing algorithm assessment of a custom battery management system are used as a case study to evaluate the developed battery emulator platform. Results demonstrate the effective advantages of the developed platform to assess the battery management system safety functionalities and algorithms. Finally, the platform is made freely available to accelerate research and innovation in the field of energy storage technology.","[Verani, Alessandro; Di Rienzo, Roberto; Nicodemo, Niccolo; Baronti, Federico; Roncella, Roberto; Saletti, Roberto] Univ Pisa, Dipartimento Ingn Informaz, I-56122 Pisa, Italy",University of Pisa,"Di Rienzo, R (corresponding author), Univ Pisa, Dipartimento Ingn Informaz, I-56122 Pisa, Italy.",roberto.dirienzo@unipi.it,,"DI RIENZO, ROBERTO/0000-0002-4238-5864; Nicodemo, Niccolo/0000-0001-8322-4250","Centro Nazionale di Mobilit Sostenibile (MOST)-Sustainable Mobility Center funded by the European Union Next-GenerationEU (Piano Nazionale di Ripresa e Resilienza (PNRR)-Missione 4 Componente 2, Investimento 1.4-D.D. 1033 17/06/2022)","Centro Nazionale di Mobilit Sostenibile (MOST)-Sustainable Mobility Center funded by the European Union Next-GenerationEU (Piano Nazionale di Ripresa e Resilienza (PNRR)-Missione 4 Componente 2, Investimento 1.4-D.D. 1033 17/06/2022)",No Statement Available,,56,0,0,4,4,IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC,PISCATAWAY,"445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA",2169-3536,,,IEEE ACCESS,IEEE Access,,2024,12,,,,,,84488,84497,,10.1109/ACCESS.2024.3413187,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2024.3413187,,,10,"Computer Science, Information Systems; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Telecommunications",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Computer Science; Engineering; Telecommunications,WB7Y0,,gold,,,2024-08-15,WOS:001252485200001,,,,203

Print management inherently conforms with the rationale and mentality of green and eco-friendly technologies that also relate with the ethos of the open source movement in IT. One would expect that open source print management solutions would thrive; however, the vast majority of integrated management systems are commercial. There is only a small number of valuable open source print accounting solutions, but there are none that integrate accounting with a form of credit reception. This paper presents the design of an open system that integrates the provision of automated credit reception with accounting services in order to produce an open solution that fully automates the business process of print charging. The objective is to design the necessary automations for credit reception so that it can be realized without any human intervention, to plan the integration with a suitable open print accounting system and to specify any complementary utilities and tools necessary for production installations.","[Kalochristianakis, Michael; Grammatikakis, Kostas; Saldaris, Manolis; Demesoukas, Ioannis; Tzanodaskalakis, Grigoris] Fac Sci & Engn, Lib & Informat Ctr, Iraklion 71409, Greece",,"Kalochristianakis, M (corresponding author), Fac Sci & Engn, Lib & Informat Ctr, Iraklion 71409, Greece.",kalohr@lib.uoc.gr; kgram@lib.uoc.gr; saldaris@lib.uoc.gr; demas@lib.uoc.gr; grigoris@lib.uoc.gr,,,University of Crete,University of Crete,This work was supported in part by the University of Crete.,,8,1,1,0,15,IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC,PISCATAWAY,"445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA",1932-8184,1937-9234,,IEEE SYST J,IEEE Syst.

Within these communities for peer production, citizens can apply cutting-edge technologies in DIY projects. In recent decades, mushrooming makerspaces and hacklabs were embraced by the tech industry and governments alike. Feminist makerspaces and hacklabs, however, as they are centred around a queer feminist agenda, have raised eyebrows. In order to foster diversity in tech development, they create safer spaces for self-expression. Here, feminist lay(wo)men* (To emphasise that the category 'Woman' is constructed and that more people than only those who identify as women are being included, one uses the sign * after the term 'women' ), makers, designers, artists and tinkerers experiment with open-source hardware and software. Art and design projects emerging from feminist hacklabs focus on issues of representation and democratic participation in digital media, as well as on ways of reclaiming one's own body. This article tries to unpack how, after an exhibition on sexual health norms, a feminist hacklab was attacked by local right-wing and conservative politicians. The attack resulted in the defunding of the feminist hacklab. But it also started a transformation process within the collective, as members became aware of critical interferences of diffracting marginalisations. The crisis triggered a discussion on how each member was threatened to very different degrees; for example, there was more at stake for members depending on their legal status in the country. The right-wing and conservative campaign against the feminist hacklab damaged the initiative, but at the same time it pushed the collective to generate increased vehemence and resilience.","[Wuschitz, Stefanie] Inst Philosophie Literatur Wissenschafts & Techni, Berlin, Germany",,"Wuschitz, S (corresponding author), TU Berlin, Hochschulprogramm DiGiTal, Inst Hist & Philosophy Sci Technol & Literature, Fac Human & Educ Sci 1, Berlin, Germany.",wuschitz@protonmail.com,,"Wuschitz, Stefanie/0000-0003-2519-449X",Berliner Hochschulprogramm DiGiTal,Berliner Hochschulprogramm DiGiTal,"The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This work was supported by the Berliner Hochschulprogramm DiGiTal.",,114,1,1,0,1,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",1464-7001,1741-2773,,FEM THEOR,Fem.

Recently, human and rodent studies using virtual reality (VR) environments have shown VR to be an important tool for uncovering the neural mechanisms underlying spatial learning in the hippocampus and cortex, due to the extremely precise control over parameters such as spatial and contextual cues. Setting up virtual environments for rodent spatial behaviors can, however, be costly and require an extensive background in engineering and computer programming. Here, we present a simple yet powerful system based upon inexpensive, modular, open-source hardware and software that enables researchers to study spatial learning in head-restrained mice using a VR environment. This system uses coupled microcontrollers to measure locomotion and deliver behavioral stimuli while head-restrained mice run on a wheel in concert with a virtual linear track environment rendered by a graphical software package running on a single-board computer. The emphasis on distributed processing allows researchers to design flexible, modular systems to elicit and measure complex spatial behaviors in mice in order to determine the connection between neural circuit activity and spatial learning in the mammalian brain.","[Lacefield, Clay; Cai, Hongtao; Ho, Huong; Dias, Carla; Chung, Hannah; Hen, Rene; Turi, Gergely F.] New York State Psychiat Inst & Hosp, Div Syst Neurosci, New York, NY 10032 USA; [Lacefield, Clay; Hen, Rene; Turi, Gergely F.] Columbia Univ, Dept Psychiat, New York, NY 10027 USA",New York State Psychiatry Institute; Columbia University,"Lacefield, C; Turi, GF (corresponding author), New York State Psychiat Inst & Hosp, Div Syst Neurosci, New York, NY 10032 USA.; Lacefield, C; Turi, GF (corresponding author), Columbia Univ, Dept Psychiat, New York, NY 10027 USA.",col8@cumc.columbia.edu; gt2253@cumc.columbia.edu,"Turi, Gergely/G-5054-2019","Turi, Gergely/0000-0001-5651-9459","BBRF Young Investigator Award; NIMH [1R21MH122965, R01MH068542]; NINDS [R56NS128177]",BBRF Young Investigator Award; NIMH(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH)); NINDS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Neurological Disorders & Stroke (NINDS)),"We would like to thank Noah Pettit from the Harvey lab for the discussion and suggestions while developing the protocol in this manuscript.

The miniaturization of mass-produced actuators and sensors enables the use of technically extremely complex functions in smartphones at a very low price. They can be used to implement modern microscopy methods for use in places where access to such techniques is often very limited. In this review, we show how easy it is to integrate a smartphone into the everyday microscopy-imaging routines of biology research. Such devices have also been used to identify diseases directly at the patient. Furthermore, we demonstrate how constantly increasing computing power in combination with the steadily improving imaging quality of cameras of handheld devices enables the realization of new biomedical imaging methods, which together with commercially available and 3D-printed components make current research available to a broad mass.

In the fields of materials science and mechanical engineering, fundamental equipment such as tensile testing devices can cost tens to hundreds of thousands of dollars. While a research lab often has access to a large-scale testing machine suitable for conventional samples, loading devices for meso-and micro-scale samples for in-situ testing with the myriad of microscopy tools are often hard to source and cost prohibitive. Open-source software has allowed for great strides in the reduction of costs associated with software development and open-source hardware and additive manufacturing have the potential to similarly reduce the costs of scientific equipment and increase the accessibility of scientific research. To investigate the feasibility of open-source hardware, a micro-tensile tester was designed with a freely accessible computer-aided design package and manufactured with a desktop 3D-printer and off-the-shelf components. To our knowledge this is one of the first demonstrations of a tensile tester with additively manufactured components for scientific research. The capabilities of the tensile tester were demonstrated by investigating the mechanical properties of Graphene Oxide (GO) paper and thin films. A 3D printed tensile tester was successfully used in conjunction with an atomic force microscope to provide one of the first quantitative measurements of GO thin film buckling under compression. The tensile tester was also used in conjunction with an atomic force microscope to observe the change in surface topology of a GO paper in response to increasing tensile strain. No significant change in surface topology was observed in contrast to prior hypotheses from the literature. Based on this result obtained with the new open source tensile stage we propose an alternative hypothesis we term 'superlamellae consolidation' to explain the initial deformation of GO paper. The additively manufactured tensile tester tested represents cost savings of > 99% compared to commercial solutions in its class and offers simple customization. However, continued development is needed for the tensile tester presented here to approach the technical specifications achievable with commercial solutions.","[Nandy, Krishanu; Collinson, David W.; Scheftic, Charlie M.; Brinson, L.

However, coding education in Thailand appears to lag behind that of many other countries due to the lack of accessible coding learning resources suitable for students as well as the limited number of teachers with coding experience. Regarding these issues, we have developed an open-source hardware-based coding platform named KidBright, based on these requirements: 1. making coding simple for novice learners through the use of graphical blocks with Thai and English support; 2. inspiring young students to develop creative embedded applications with minimal effort; and 3. providing sustainable support for coding education. KidBright is proposed as a coding learning tool that can motivate children to learn to code and develop embedded system projects using its block-based coding environment, the KidBright IDE, in conjunction with its embedded device, the KidBright board. KidBright is distinguished from other embedded programming platforms due to the deployment of a dedicated software framework as the backend of the KidBright IDE. In this article, we introduce KidBright and present the design, architecture, and demonstrations of the software framework, the key roles of which are to conceal low-level hardware issues from learners and to enable makers to develop new command blocks and hardware peripherals in support of KidBright. We claim that, with this particular design, KidBright can help support coding education sustainably. In particular, we present how a small research team introduces coding to a large number of learners who have little or no coding experience, resulting in an impact on coding education in the country.","[Tan-a-ram, Surapol; Leelayuttho, Anuchit; Kittipiyakul, Somphong; Pornsukjantra, Wuthipong; Sereevoravitgul, Thundluck; Intarapanich, Apichart; Kaewkamnerd, Saowaluck; Treeumnuk, Dusadee] Natl Sci & Technol Dev Agcy NSTDA, Natl Elect & Comp Technol Ctr NECTEC, Pathum Thani 12120, Thailand",National Science & Technology Development Agency - Thailand; National Electronics & Computer Technology Center (NECTEC),"Treeumnuk, D (corresponding author), Natl Sci & Technol Dev Agcy NSTDA, Natl Elect & Comp Technol Ctr NECTEC, Pathum Thani 12120, Thailand.",dusadee.treeumnuk@nectec.or.th,"Tan-a-ram, Surapol/GYU-7316-2022","Tan-a-ram, Surapol/0000-0003-3162-1590; Treeumnuk, Dusadee/0000-0002-9743-2787","National Electronics and Computer Technology Center (NECTEC); National Science and Technology Development Agency (NSTDA) [P2052225, P2150643]",National Electronics and Computer Technology Center (NECTEC); National Science and Technology Development Agency (NSTDA),"This work was supported in part by the National Electronics and Computer Technology Center (NECTEC), and in part by the National Science and Technology Development Agency (NSTDA) through projects P2052225 and P2150643.",,46,0,0,2,8,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2071-1050,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,NOV,2022,14,21,,,,,,,14528,10.3390/su142114528,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su142114528,,,31,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,6E8RI,,gold,,,2024-08-15,WOS:000883640600001,,,,211

From a tribological point of view, these are often linked to the reduction of wear and friction. When testing new materials, coating systems or lubricants, the underlying mechanisms and physical relationships are investigated by the deployment of simplified model tests. Advanced commercial test rigs allow high -resolution measurement of important friction and wear parameters, but also entail a considerable cost and thus a certain entry barrier to deal further with tribological aspects. In many research projects, therefore, self -developed test rigs are used, which at the same time, however, makes comparability and reproducibility with other systems considerably more difficult. For this reason, we have developed a pin -on -disc tribometer based on the open hardware approach, which can be completely additively manufactured by fused filament fabrication. In addition to presenting the customizable measurement system, we investigated the measurement capability using 50 repeated measurements on two different tribological test systems. The reproducibility of the measured values was 0.4 % and 1.1 % for friction and 0.6 % and 1.0 % for wear and was thus considerably lower than the standard deviation in the tests on a single tribometer, which was up to 7.7 % and 16.1 % for friction and wear, respectively. So, the presented tribometer can be used, for example, to perform high throughput tests and thus to detect systematic correlations, e.g., in combination with machine learning approaches. Another area of application is training and education of students and professionals.","[Orgeldinger, Christian; Rosnitschek, Tobias; Tremmel, Stephan] Univ Bayreuth, Engn Design & CAD, Univ Str 30, D-95447 Bayreuth, Germany",University of Bayreuth,"Orgeldinger, C (corresponding author), Univ Bayreuth, Engn Design & CAD, Univ Str 30, D-95447 Bayreuth, Germany.",christian.orgeldinger@uni-bayreuth.de,,,University of Bayreuth,University of Bayreuth,"The authors greatly acknowledge the continuous support of the University of Bayreuth.

To automate and monitor these challenging infrastructures, industrial equipment is used due to their reliability and versatility. In particular, Programmable Logic Controllers (PLCs) are the prevalent automation units devoted to process control. They are combined with Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems, responsible of acquiring and displaying operational data. One of the prominent trends to facilitate such deployment is the open source movement, being the Arduino microcontroller one of the most illustrative examples. This low-cost and community-supported platform is achieving increasing attention from academy and industry. However, there is still a need of integration frameworks to combine this device with reliable industrial equipment. This paper presents an approach that seamlessly integrates PLCs and Arduino platforms into a common SCADA system using the connectivity provided by Open Platform Communications (OPC). The open source device is devoted to sensing tasks. As a proof of concept, an application case has been carried out within the automation system of an experimental SMG, where the temperature of a PV panel is sensed and monitored. The developed system is described and successful results are reported.","[Gonzalez, Isaias; Jose Calderon, Antonio] Univ Extremadura, Dept Elect Engn Elect & Automat, Ave Elvas S-N, Badajoz 06006, Spain",Universidad de Extremadura,"González, I (corresponding author), Univ Extremadura, Dept Elect Engn Elect & Automat, Ave Elvas S-N, Badajoz 06006, Spain.",igonzp@unex.es; ajcalde@unex.es,"Calderón, Antonio José/R-4094-2019; González, Isaías/Y-7300-2018","Calderón, Antonio José/0000-0003-2094-209X; González, Isaías/0000-0001-5645-3832",Junta de Extremadura (Spain) in the VI Plan Regional de I + D + i (2017-2020) [IB18041]; European Regional Development Funds FEDER (Programa Operativo FEDER de Extremadura 2014-2020),Junta de Extremadura (Spain) in the VI Plan Regional de I + D + i (2017-2020); European Regional Development Funds FEDER (Programa Operativo FEDER de Extremadura 2014-2020)(European Union (EU)),"This work is a contribution of the project IB18041 supported by the Junta de Extremadura (Spain) in the VI Plan Regional de I + D + i (2017-2020), cofinanced by European Regional Development Funds FEDER (Programa Operativo FEDER de Extremadura 2014-2020).

In this paper, we propose strategies for the placement of CU and DU network functions in the regional and edge O-Cloud nodes while jointly associating the users to RUs. The aim is to minimize the end-to-end delay of users and minimize the cost of O-RAN deployment. Thus, we first formulate the end-to-end delay, the cost, and the constraints. We then model the problem as a multi-objective optimization problem The optimization formulation consists of a huge number of constraints and variables. To provide a solution to the problem, we develop the corresponding Markov Decision Problem (MDP) and propose a Deep Q-Network (DQN)-based algorithm. The simulation results demonstrate that our proposed scheme reduces the average user delay up to 40% and the deployment cost up to 20% with respect to our baselines.","[Joda, Roghayeh; Pamuklu, Turgay; Iturria-Rivera, Pedro Enrique; Erol-Kantarci, Melike] Univ Ottawa, Sch Elect Engn & Comp Sci, Ottawa, ON K1N 6N5, Canada; [Joda, Roghayeh] Ericsson Canada, Ottawa, ON K2K 2V6, Canada",University of Ottawa; Ericsson,"Erol-Kantarci, M (corresponding author), Univ Ottawa, Sch Elect Engn & Comp Sci, Ottawa, ON K1N 6N5, Canada.",roghayeh.joda@ericsson.com; turgay.pamuklu@uottawa.ca; pitur008@uottawa.ca; melike.erolkantarci@uottawa.ca,"pamuklu, turgay/AAO-2127-2020; Joda, Roghayeh/AAM-6483-2021; Iturria Rivera, Pedro Enrique/JXN-4857-2024","pamuklu, turgay/0000-0003-1444-8263; Joda, Roghayeh/0000-0002-1273-8067; Iturria Rivera, Pedro Enrique/0000-0002-8757-2639; Erol-Kantarci, Melike/0000-0001-6787-8457",NSERC Canada Research Chairs Program,NSERC Canada Research Chairs Program(Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)),This work is supported by the NSERC Canada Research Chairs Program.

Among Trusted Execution Environment (TEE), an open-source RISC-V Keystone TEE is the expected one. However, some issues remain when applying it to various devices: untrusted DRAM, and untrusted path to non-volatile storage. These issues can be resolved by Memory Protection Engine (MPE) based on an integrity tree, and Non-Volatile Main Memory (NVMM), respectively. TEE, MPE, and NVMM must be cooperatively optimized to exploit performance. Despite this demand, there is no widely available platform which enables fast, reliable, and system-wide evaluation. In the paper, we provide an open-source hardware simulator for secure edge devices. We implemented an MPE using SGX-style Integrity Tree on the Keystone compatible RISC-V SoC. Then, we ported the NVMM simulation technique to it. Its whole design was publicized to widely provide a baseline hardware design. The MPE behavior was validated by using micro benchmarks. It revealed that the MPE read/write overhead 2.55 x /4.16x on DRAM, and 3.05 x /5.40x on NVMM, respectively Besides, we discuss our work's role by comparing with the gem5 considering TEE evaluation time and impact of the protected NVMM.","[Omori, Yu; Kimura, Keiji] Waseda Univ, Dept Comp Sci & Engn, Tokyo 1698050, Japan",Waseda University,"Kimura, K (corresponding author), Waseda Univ, Dept Comp Sci & Engn, Tokyo 1698050, Japan.",oy@kasahara.cs.waseda.ac.jp; keiji@waseda.jp,"Kimura, Keiji/GWV-7240-2022","Kimura, Keiji/0000-0003-2325-4866; OMORI, Yu/0000-0002-7554-6214",,,,,22,0,0,2,3,IEEE COMPUTER SOC,LOS ALAMITOS,"10662 LOS VAQUEROS CIRCLE, PO BOX 3014, LOS ALAMITOS, CA 90720-1314 USA",1556-6056,1556-6064,,IEEE COMPUT ARCHIT L,IEEE Comput.

Here, we summarise community-driven approaches based on Free and Open Source scientific and medical Hardware (FOSH) as well as personal protective equipment (PPE) currently being developed and deployed to support the global response for COVID-19 prevention, patient treatment and diagnostics.","[Chagas, Andre Maia; Baden, Tom] Univ Sussex, Sch Life Sci, Sussex Neurosci, Brighton, E Sussex, England; [Chagas, Andre Maia; Prieto-Godino, Lucia L.; Baden, Tom] TReND Africa, Brighton, E Sussex, England; [Chagas, Andre Maia; Molloy, Jennifer C.] Univ Cambridge, Gathering Open Sci Hardware, Cambridge, England; [Molloy, Jennifer C.] Univ Cambridge, Dept Chem Engn & Biotechnol, Cambridge, England; [Prieto-Godino, Lucia L.] Francis Crick Inst, London, England; [Prieto-Godino, Lucia L.; Baden, Tom] Univ Tubingen, FENS KAVLI Network Excellence, Tubingen, Germany; [Baden, Tom] Univ Tubingen, Inst Ophthalm Res, Tubingen, Germany",University of Sussex; University of Cambridge; University of Cambridge; Francis Crick Institute; Eberhard Karls University of Tubingen; Eberhard Karls University of Tubingen; Eberhard Karls University Hospital,"Chagas, AM; Baden, T (corresponding author), Univ Sussex, Sch Life Sci, Sussex Neurosci, Brighton, E Sussex, England.; Chagas, AM; Prieto-Godino, LL; Baden, T (corresponding author), TReND Africa, Brighton, E Sussex, England.; Chagas, AM; Molloy, JC (corresponding author), Univ Cambridge, Gathering Open Sci Hardware, Cambridge, England.; Molloy, JC (corresponding author), Univ Cambridge, Dept Chem Engn & Biotechnol, Cambridge, England.; Prieto-Godino, LL (corresponding author), Francis Crick Inst, London, England.; Prieto-Godino, LL; Baden, T (corresponding author), Univ Tubingen, FENS KAVLI Network Excellence, Tubingen, Germany.; Baden, T (corresponding author), Univ Tubingen, Inst Ophthalm Res, Tubingen, Germany.",a.maia-chagas@sussex.ac.uk; jcm80@cam.ac.uk; lucia.prietogodino@crick.ac.uk; baden@sussex.ac.uk,"Chagas, Andre/AFR-6550-2022; Baden, Tom/H-1412-2011","Molloy, Jenny/0000-0003-3477-8462; Prieto-Godino, Lucia L/0000-0002-2980-362X; Baden, Tom/0000-0003-2808-4210; Maia Chagas, Andre/0000-0003-2609-3017","European Research Council [677687, 802531]; UKRI (BBSRC) [BB/R014817/1]; UKRI (MRC) [MC_PC_15071]; UKRI (EPSRC) [EP/R014000/1]; Leverhulme Trust [PLP2017-005]; Lister Institute for Preventive Medicine; Shuttleworth Foundation; Francis Crick Institute; European Research Council (ERC) [802531, 677687] Funding Source: European Research Council (ERC); BBSRC [BB/R014817/1] Funding Source: UKRI; GCRF [EP/R014000/1] Funding Source: UKRI; MRC [MC_PC_15071] Funding Source: UKRI",European Research Council(European Research Council (ERC)); UKRI (BBSRC)(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC)); UKRI (MRC)(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Medical Research Council UK (MRC)); UKRI (EPSRC)(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)); Leverhulme Trust(Leverhulme Trust); Lister Institute for Preventive Medicine; Shuttleworth Foundation; Francis Crick Institute; European Research Council (ERC)(European Research Council (ERC)Spanish Government); BBSRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC)); GCRF(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)); MRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Medical Research Council UK (MRC)),"Funding was provided by the European Research Council (ERC-StG ""NeuroVisEco"" 677687 to TB and ERC StG ""EvoNeuroCircuit"" 802531 to LLPG), the UKRI (BBSRC, BB/R014817/1 to TB; MRC, MC_PC_15071 to TB; EPSRC EP/R014000/1 to JCM), the Leverhulme Trust (PLP2017-005 to TB), the Lister Institute for Preventive Medicine (to TB), the Shuttleworth Foundation (to JCM), and The Francis Crick Institute (to LLPG).

One limitation of this model system is the lack of long-term storage for genetic resources. In this study, approaches for Hydractinia sperm cryopreservation were established for the first time. Open hardware and 3-D printing were used to facilitate animal husbandry, sperm handling, and cryopreservation. Hydractinia sperm at a concentration of 2 x 10(7) cells/mL stored at 4 degrees C for as long as 6 d were able to achieve 50% fertilization rate. A fertilization rate of 41-69% was observed using sperm equilibrated with 5, 10, or 15% (v/v) cryoprotectant (dimethyl sulfoxide or methanol) for 20 min, cooled at a rate of 5, 10, or 20 degrees C/min from 4 degrees C to -80 degrees C, at a cell concentration of 1 x 10(8) sperm/mL, in 0.25 mL French straws. Establishing repository capabilities for the Hydractinia research community will be essential for future development, maintenance, protection, and distribution of genetic resources. More broadly, these generalizable approaches can be used as a model to develop germplasm repositories for other cnidarian species. Hydractinia symbiolongicarpus is an emerging model organism in which cutting-edge genomic tools and resources are being developed for use in a growing number of research fields. One limitation of this model system is the lack of long-term storage for genetic resources. The goal of this study was to establish a generalizable cryopreservation approach for Hydractinia that would support future repository development for other cnidarian species. Specific objectives were to: (1) characterize basic parameters related to sperm quality; (2) develop a generalizable approach for sperm collection; (3) assess the feasibility of in vitro fertilization (IVF) with sperm after refrigerated storage; (4) assess the feasibility of IVF with sperm cryopreserved with various sperm concentrations; (5) evaluate feasibility of cryopreservation with various freezing conditions, and (6) explore the feasibility of cryopreservation by use of a 3-D printed open-hardware (CryoKit) device. Animal husbandry and sperm collection were facilitated by use of 3-D printed open hardware. Hydractinia sperm at a concentration of 2 x 10(7) cells/mL stored at 4 degrees C for 6 d were able to achieve 50% fertilization rate. It appeared that relatively higher sperm concentration (>5 x 10(7) cells/mL) for cryopreservation could promote fertilization. A fertilization rate of 41-69% was observed using sperm equilibrated with 5, 10, or 15% (v/v) cryoprotectant (dimethyl sulfoxide or methanol) for 20 min, cooled at a rate of 5, 10, or 20 degrees C/min from 4 degrees C to -80 degrees C, at a cell concentration of 10(8)/mL, in 0.25 mL French straws. Samples cryopreserved with the CryoKit produced a fertilization rate of 72-82%. Establishing repository capabilities for the Hydractinia research community will be essential for future development, maintenance, protection, and distribution of genetic resources.

The open source PAPR can be fabricated with a low-cost 3-D printer and widely available components for less than $150, replacing commercial conversion kits saving 85% or full-fledged proprietary PAPRs saving over 90%. The parametric designs allow for adaptation to other core components and can be custom fit specifically to fire-fighter equipment, including their suspenders. The open source PAPR has controllable air flow and its design enables breathing even if the fan is disconnected or if the battery dies. The open source PAPR was tested for air flow as a function of battery life and was found to meet NIOSH air flow requirements for 4 h, which is 300% over expected regular use. (C) 2020 The Authors.

Nowadays, in parallel to the growth of the chemical industry, new chemical compounds have been developed, such as dyes and medicines. The increasing use of these products has led to the appearance of recalcitrant pollutants in industrial wastewater, and even in the drinking water circuit of our populations. The current work presents a photoreactor prototype that allows the performance of experiments for the decomposition of coloured pollutants using photocatalysis at the laboratory scale. The design of this device included the study of the photometric technique for light emission and the development of a software that allows monitoring the dye degradation process. Open-source hardware platforms, such as Arduino, were used for the monitoring system, which have the advantages of being low-cost platforms. A software application that manages the communication of the reactor with the computer and graphically displays the data read by the sensor was also developed. The results obtained demonstrated that this device can accelerate the photodegradation reaction in addition to monitoring the changes throughout the process.","[Ruiz-Flores, Alberto; Brox, Maria; Gersnoviez, Andres; Canete-Carmona, Eduardo] Univ Cordoba, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, Leonardo Vinci Bldg,Rabanales Campus, Cordoba 14071, Spain; [Garcia, Araceli; Pineda, Antonio] Univ Cordoba, Dept Organ Chem, Marie Curie Bldg,Rabanales Campus, Cordoba 14071, Spain",Universidad de Cordoba; Universidad de Cordoba,"Cañete-Carmona, E (corresponding author), Univ Cordoba, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, Leonardo Vinci Bldg,Rabanales Campus, Cordoba 14071, Spain.",ecanete@uco.es,"Cañete, Eduardo/G-3553-2018; Gersnoviez, Andrés/P-5146-2015; Brox Jimenez, Maria/N-4447-2014; Garcia, Araceli/A-7774-2016","Cañete, Eduardo/0000-0002-0384-1660; Gersnoviez, Andrés/0000-0002-5515-2584; Ruiz Flores, Alberto/0000-0001-5792-5643; Brox Jimenez, Maria/0000-0002-4002-3253; Pineda, Antonio/0000-0003-2229-4989; Garcia, Araceli/0000-0003-1063-8043",University of Cordoba [PID-2020-4-5002],University of Cordoba,This research was funded by University of Cordoba grant number PID-2020-4-5002.,,26,2,2,1,7,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,1424-8220,,SENSORS-BASEL,Sensors,JAN,2023,23,2,,,,,,,775,10.3390/s23020775,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/s23020775,,,13,"Chemistry, Analytical; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Instruments & Instrumentation",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Chemistry; Engineering; Instruments & Instrumentation,8E4XL,36679572.0,"Green Published, gold",,,2024-08-15,WOS:000918978100001,,,,220

A gate, such as a door, can have a lock mechanism for securing the area from unauthorized access. Most commercial solutions for access control management offer pre-packaged software systems where customization of the authorization logic is either not allowed or subject to payment. Moreover, cross-platform development is a barrier for solution providers due to the high cost of development and maintenance that it implies. To overcome these limitations and further optimize the entire access control systems development process, we propose a model-driven approach that supports automatic code generation to enable communication between an IoT infrastructure and platforms for Facility Access Management. Specifically, the approach combines the benefits of Near-Field Communication (NFC) and Tinkerforge (i.e., an open-source hardware platform) with model-driven techniques. This allows the approach to exploit both behavioral and structural models for the modeling and the consequent code generation of part of the authorization mechanism, thus providing complete coverage of the code generated for the whole system. We implemented and evaluated our approach in a real-world case study within the premises of a fitness center with an IoT infrastructure consisting of several heterogeneous sensors by showing its practical applicability. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in supporting abstraction and automation concerning traditional code-centric development through code generation features. Consequently, our approach makes the whole development process less time-consuming and error-prone, thus reducing the system's time to market.","[De Sanctis, Martina; Iovino, Ludovico; Rossi, Maria Teresa] Gran Sasso Sci Inst, Comp Sci Sci Area, I-67100 Laquila, Italy; [Di Salle, Amleto] European Univ Rome, Human Sci Dept, I-00163 Rome, Italy",Gran Sasso Science Institute (GSSI); European University of Rome,"Iovino, L (corresponding author), Gran Sasso Sci Inst, Comp Sci Sci Area, I-67100 Laquila, Italy.",martina.desanctis@gssi.it; amleto.disalle@unier.it; ludovico.iovino@gssi.it; mariateresa.rossi@gssi.it,,"Rossi, Maria Teresa/0000-0003-0273-7324; Iovino, Ludovico/0000-0001-6552-2609; DI SALLE, AMLETO/0000-0002-0163-9784",Gran Sasso Science Institute- GSSI within the CRUI-CARE Agreement,Gran Sasso Science Institute- GSSI within the CRUI-CARE Agreement,Open access funding provided by Gran Sasso Science Institute- GSSI within the CRUI-CARE Agreement.,,58,0,0,0,4,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1433-2779,1433-2787,,INT J SOFTW TOOLS TE,Int.

Radio-frequency identification (RFID) tags represent some of the smallest animal-borne technologies available. They are frequently used for understanding fine-scale associations between animals and their environments. However, currently available devices are often prohibitively expensive or difficult to customise. 2. We present 'WildWID', an open-source radio-frequency identification system that can be used for detecting encounters between tags and loggers and/or integrated into more advanced experimental set-ups for triggering audio or visual playbacks following the detection of RFID tag codes. WildWID systems can be made using commercially available components (costing similar to$20 USD for tags and similar to$60 for loggers) and can be customised to fit project and species-specific needs. 3. WildWID tags have been deployed on a range of species including koalas Phascolarctos cinereus, lions Panthera leo and shy albatross Thalassarche cauta for a range of research topics, including the assessment of road-crossing structures and species' responses to intraspecific competitors. 4. WildWID is a cost-effective RFID system that can increase the accessibility of this technology for a wider range of researchers and study questions. Its use provides researchers with opportunities to mitigate ethical concerns, for example, by customising systems for species-specific conditions, and its customisability extends the range of applications where RFID systems can be used by field biologists.","[Rafiq, Kasim] Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Environm Studies Dept, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA; [Rafiq, Kasim; Radford, Cameron; Jordan, Neil R.] Botswana Predator Conservat, Maun, Botswana; [Appleby, Rob G.; Dexter, Cathryn E.; Jones, Darryl N.; Blacker, Amy R.

To preserve this investment, attention must be given to proper maintenance. Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) has emerged as a tool to support this task. Networks of smart sensors, built upon wireless communication, have the potential to significantly improve SHM. Numerous platforms for smart sensors have been developed, most of which utilise proprietary hardware/software. The Berkeley Mote, utilised in this study, was the first open hardware/software platform to be developed. However, the Berkeley Mote was designed for generic applications and therefore the available sensors are not optimised for use in civil infrastructure applications. Acceleration and strain are among the most important physical quantities to judge the health of a structure. Although commercially available sensor boards have accelerometers, their applicability towards civil infrastructure is limited. This paper presents the development of new acceleration and strain sensor boards based on the Berkely-Mote platform and provides experimental verification of their performance within civil infrastructure applications.","Univ Autonoma Metropolitana Azcapotzalco, Dept Mat, Mexico City 02200, DF, Mexico; Univ Illinois, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Urbana, IL 61801 USA",Universidad Autonoma Metropolitana - Mexico; University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign,"Ruiz-Sandoval, M (corresponding author), Univ Autonoma Metropolitana Azcapotzalco, Dept Mat, Av San Pablo 180, Mexico City 02200, DF, Mexico.",,"Spencer, Billie F/G-8439-2013; nagayama, tomonori/G-4465-2019","nagayama, tomonori/0000-0003-1387-4738",,,,,16,23,30,1,10,IMPERIAL COLLEGE PRESS,LONDON,"57 SHELTON ST, COVENT GARDEN, LONDON WC2H 9HE, ENGLAND",1363-2469,,,J EARTHQ ENG,J.

This work presents a method to measure the internal mechanical condition of lithium-ion cells with high spatial resolution through scanning acoustic imaging. An open-hardware ultrasound scan set-up has been engineered to increase the availability of acoustic imaging significantly. Using this set-up, three cells that were aged and clamped at different pressures have been imaged. The resulting ultrasound image clearly showed which parts of the cells have more severely aged than others. The cells which were clamped with the highest examined pressure (5 and 10 bar) showed the strongest covering layer and gas formation in the ultrasound scan. The mechanical effect of the aging seen in the ultrasound image was verified for each cell by conventional electrical and post-mortem analysis. At locations where the ultrasound image showed distinct irregularities, scanning electron microscopy images identified mossy surface layers typical for lithium plating.","[Wasylowski, David; Kisseler, Niklas; Ditler, Heinrich; Sonnet, Morian; Fuchs, Georg; Ringbeck, Florian; Sauer, Dirk Uwe] Rhein Westfal TH Aachen, Inst Power Elect & Elect Drives ISEA, Chair Electrochem Energy Convers & Storage Syst, Jagerstr 17-19, D-52066 Aachen, Germany; [Sauer, Dirk Uwe] Rhein Westfal TH Aachen, Inst Power Generat & Storage Syst PGS, E ON ERC, Mathieustr 10, D-52074 Aachen, Germany; [Wasylowski, David; Ditler, Heinrich; Sonnet, Morian; Ringbeck, Florian; Sauer, Dirk Uwe] JARA Energy, Julich Aachen Res Alliance, Templergraben 55, D-52056 Aachen, Germany; [Sauer, Dirk Uwe] Forschungszentrum Julich, Helmholtz Inst Munster HI MS, IEK 12, D-52425 Julich, Germany; [Fuchs, Georg] Safion GmbH, Huttenstr 7, D-52068 Aachen, Germany",RWTH Aachen University; E-ON; RWTH Aachen University; Helmholtz Association; Research Center Julich,"Wasylowski, D (corresponding author), Rhein Westfal TH Aachen, Inst Power Elect & Elect Drives ISEA, Chair Electrochem Energy Convers & Storage Syst, Jagerstr 17-19, D-52066 Aachen, Germany.",david.wasylowski@isea.rwth-aachen.de,"Sauer, Dirk Uwe/A-7414-2012","Sauer, Dirk Uwe/0000-0002-5622-3591; Ditler, Heinrich/0000-0002-4320-6207; Wasylowski, David/0000-0001-8629-7439; Sonnet, Morian/0000-0002-6168-2880; Kisseler, Niklas/0000-0002-6462-3042","Federal Ministry of Education and Research, Germany, the research cluster ""Batterienutzungskonzepte'' through the project MADAM4Life [03XP0327C]; Federal Ministry of Education and Research, Germany, the research cluster ""AQua'' through the project InOPlaBat [03XP0352A]","Federal Ministry of Education and Research, Germany, the research cluster ""Batterienutzungskonzepte'' through the project MADAM4Life; Federal Ministry of Education and Research, Germany, the research cluster ""AQua'' through the project InOPlaBat","This work was funded by the Federal Ministry of Education and Research, Germany as part of the research cluster ""Batterienutzungskonzepte'' through the project MADAM4Life (grant number 03XP0327C) and as part of the research cluster ""AQua'' through the project InOPlaBat (grant number 03XP0352A).

In science, technology, engineering and mathematics, it is important that practical training be an integral part of the curriculum. Laborem project developed at the technological university institute in Bayonne, France, enables undergraduate students to carry out part of their lab experiments in electronics remotely. Started in 2011, Laborem platform was based on proprietary solutions. Since 2017, the platform has migrated to open source software (PyScada) and open source interface box (Laborem Box), which was developed in order to enable the connection of several circuit boards to be studied. These boards, called plugs, are easily interchangeable and enable teachers to quickly adapt the proposed circuits to their course. The software also provides a simple front panel to adapt the human machine interface that is available for students. Laborem Box consists of a 3D printable box, a power supply board, a set of plugs, and a motherboard that enables students to study the selected plug. In addition, a single board computer is embedded and a hard disk can be used if necessary. This paper is intended to describe the hardware and software design of Laborem platform, and to serve as a guide to explain how to duplicate and deploy this system, primarily dedicated to undergraduate students for learning basic electronics.(c) 2022 The Authors.

The rise of distributed digital manufacturing provides an opportunity for much more rapid lateral scaling of open source appropriate technologies for agriculture. However, the most mature distributed manufacturing area is plastic, which has limited use for many OSA applications. To overcome this limitation with design, this study reports on of a completely 3D-printable planetary roller screw linear actuator. The device is designed as a parametric script-based computer aided design (CAD) package to allow for the easy adaption for a number of applications such as food processing at different scales. The planetary roller screw is fabricated in dishwasher-safe polyethylene terephthalate glycol (PETG) on an open source machine and tested using an open source testing platform to determine if it could maintain a constant load without slipping and the maximum force. Then, this output is compared to a direct screw press using the same materials. The results found that the maximum force is more than doubled for the roller screw actuator using the same materials, making them adequate for some food processing techniques. Future work is outlined to improve the performance and ease of assembly.","[Guadagno, Marcello C.] Michigan Technol Univ, Dept Mech Engn Engn Mech, Houghton, MI 49931 USA; [Loss, Jacob M.; Pearce, Joshua M.] Michigan Technol Univ, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, Houghton, MI 49931 USA; [Pearce, Joshua M.] Michigan Technol Univ, Dept Mat Sci & Engn, Houghton, MI 49931 USA; [Pearce, Joshua M.] Aalto Univ, Sch Elect Engn, Dept Elect & Nanoengn, FI-00076 Espoo, Finland",Michigan Technological University; Michigan Technological University; Michigan Technological University; Aalto University,"Pearce, JM (corresponding author), Michigan Technol Univ, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, Houghton, MI 49931 USA.; Pearce, JM (corresponding author), Michigan Technol Univ, Dept Mat Sci & Engn, Houghton, MI 49931 USA.; Pearce, JM (corresponding author), Aalto Univ, Sch Elect Engn, Dept Elect & Nanoengn, FI-00076 Espoo, Finland.",mcguadag@mtu.edu; jmloss@mtu.edu; pearce@mtu.edu,"Pearce, Joshua/C-9240-2013","Pearce, Joshua/0000-0001-9802-3056",Witte Endowment; Aleph Objects,Witte Endowment; Aleph Objects,This research was supported by the Witte Endowment and Aleph Objects.,,75,5,5,1,11,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2227-7080,,TECHNOLOGIES,Technologies,JUN,2021,9,2,,,,,,,24,10.3390/technologies9020024,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/technologies9020024,,,26,"Engineering, Multidisciplinary",Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI),Engineering,SX7JB,,"gold, Green Published",,,2024-08-15,WOS:000665375300001,,,,227

However, the use of laboratory automation in academic laboratories is limited due to high acquisition costs and the inability to customize off-the-shelf hardware. To address these challenges, we present an Open Source Hardware concept, referred to as OpenWorkstation, to build an assembly line-inspired platform consisting of ready-to-use and customizable modules. In contrast to current standalone solutions, the OpenWorkstation concept enables the combination of single hardware modules - each with a specific set of functionalities - to a modular workstation to provide a fully automated setup. The base setup consists of a pipetting and transport module and is designed to execute basic protocol steps for in vitro research applications, including pipetting operations for liquids and viscous substances and transportation of cell culture vessels between the modules. We demonstrate the successful application of this concept within a case study by the development of a storage module to facilitate high-throughput studies and a photo-crosslinker module to initiate photo-induced polymerization of hydrogel solutions. We present a Systems Engineering framework for customized module development, guidance for the design and assembly of the presented modules, and operational instructions on the usage of the workstation. By combining capabilities from various open source instrumentations into a modular technology platform, the OpenWorkstation concept will facilitate efficient and reliable experimentation for in vitro research.

Today, developments in NdFeb magnets have caused these magnets to become essential elements in many technology fields. NdFeB magnets are widely used in the engines of hybrid electric vehicles due to the maximum energy product (BHmax). In addition, usage of NdFeB in applications such as magnetic resonance imaging, electric motors, various generators and in large-scale or small-scale wind energy generators have increased significantly. In this study, before the production of NdFeB magnets, a virtual laboratory platform which can be used in research and development studies and production is realized.The developed virtual platform is designed and run as a desktop application. In future studies, web based applications will be developed by using open source hardware.In the study, mathematical functions were obtained from data related to B-r(permanent magnetism), H-c(magnetic coercivity), BHmax, and Curie temperature obtained in researches on different NdFeB alloys in real laboratory.The virtual laboratory platform was prepared with the obtained functions. The laboratory system can be used in industry for multi-purpose. In addition, it also allows for use for educational purposes. It is aimed to save cost and time during the the research and development studies in magnet design and to perform different magnet works.","[Cakir, Musa Faruk; Karhan, Mustafa] Cankiri Karatekin Univ, Elekt & Otomasyon Bolumu, Cankiri, Turkey",Cankiri Karatekin University,"Karhan, M (corresponding author), Cankiri Karatekin Univ, Elekt & Otomasyon Bolumu, Cankiri, Turkey.",mustafakarhan@gmail.com,"Karhan, Mustafa/ABF-6315-2021","Karhan, Mustafa/0000-0001-6747-8971",,,,,29,0,0,0,6,GAZI UNIV,ANKARA,"CENTER CAMPUS TECHNOLOGY FAC B BLOCK EK BINA, 2ND FL, ANKARA, 06500, TURKEY",1302-0900,2147-9429,,J POLYTECH,J.

To further drive down the cost while improving the performance of lab-on-a-chip paper-based microfluidic prototyping, this study reports on the development of a RepRap upgrade capable of converting a Prusa Mendel RepRap into a wax 3-D printer for paper-based microfluidic applications. An open-source hardware approach is used to demonstrate a 3-D printable upgrade for the 3-D printer, which combines a heated syringe pump with the RepRap/Arduino 3-D control. The bill of materials, designs, basic assembly, and use instructions are provided, along with a completely free and open-source software tool chain.

Drawing from long-term ethnographic research, this article examines how China's makers demarcate Chinese manufacturing as a site of expertise in implementing this vision. China's makers demonstrate that the future of makingif to materialize in the ways currently envisioned by writers, politicians, and scholars of the global tech industryrests on taking seriously the technological and cultural fabrics of professional making outside familiar information technology innovation hubs like Silicon Valley: making-do, mass production, and reuse. I trace back to China's first hackerspace, documenting how a collective of makers began to move away from appropriating Western concepts of openness toward promoting China as source for knowledge, creativity, and innovation. This article demonstrates that when China's makers set up open hardware businesses and articulate a unique culture of hacking with Chinese characteristics, they draw boundaries between the professional making they saw embodied in Chinese industrial production and the hobbyist making embodied in Western histories and cultures of hacking. In so doing, they position China as site of both technological and cultural expertise, intervening in dominant conceptions of computing that split manufacturing and innovation along geographical lines.

Since manual phenotyping has limited efficiency, highthroughput phenotyping methods are recently popularized owing to progress in sensor and image processing technologies. However, in a size-limited breeding field, which is common in Japan and other Asian countries, it is challenging to introduce large machinery in the field or fly unmanned aerial vehicles over the field. In this study, we developed a ground-based high-throughput field phenotyping rover that could be easily introduced to a field regardless of the scale and location of the field even without special facilities. We also made the field rover open-source hardware, making its system available to public for easy modification, so that anyone can build one for their own use at a low cost. The trial run of the field rover revealed that it allowed the collection of detailed remote-sensing images of plants and quantitative analyses based on the images. The results suggest that the field rover developed in this study could allow efficient phenotyping of plants especially in a small breeding field.","[Kuroki, Ken; Nasuda, Shuhei] Kyoto Univ, Grad Sch Agr, Sakyo Ku, Kyoto 6068502, Japan; [Kuroki, Ken] Univ Tokyo, Grad Sch Sci, Bunkyo Ku, 7-3-1 Hongo, Tokyo 1130033, Japan; [Yan, Kai] LabRomance Inc, 1-3-29-2F Ureshino, Fujimino, Saitama 3560056, Japan; [Iwata, Hiroyoshi] Univ Tokyo, Grad Sch Agr & Life Sci, Bunkyo Ku, 1-1-1 Yayoi, Tokyo 1138657, Japan; [Shimizu, Kentaro K.] Univ Zurich, Dept Evolutionary Biol & Environm Studies, CH-8057 Zurich, Switzerland; [Shimizu, Kentaro K.; Tameshige, Toshiaki] Yokohama City Univ, Kihara Inst Biol Res, Totsuka Ku, 641-12 Maioka, Yokohama, Kanagawa 2440813, Japan; [Tameshige, Toshiaki] Niigata Univ, Fac Sci, Dept Biol, Nishi Ku, 8050 Ikarashi 2 No Cho, Niigata 9502181, Japan; [Guo, Wei] Univ Tokyo, Grad Sch Agr & Life Sci, 1-1-1 Midori, Nishitokyo, Tokyo 1880002, Japan",Kyoto University; University of Tokyo; University of Tokyo; University of Zurich; Yokohama City University; Niigata University; University of Tokyo,"Guo, W (corresponding author), Univ Tokyo, Grad Sch Agr & Life Sci, 1-1-1 Midori, Nishitokyo, Tokyo 1880002, Japan.",guowei@g.ecc.u-tokyo.ac.jp,"Guo, Wei/AAK-8956-2021; Tameshige, Toshiaki/ISB-1723-2023","Guo, Wei/0000-0002-3017-5464; Kuroki, Ken/0000-0002-2096-2747; Iwata, Hiroyoshi/0000-0002-6747-7036","JST, CREST, Japan [JPMJCR16O2, JPMJCR16O3]; Swiss National Science Foundation [31003A_ 182318]; Australia GRDC project [UOQ2002-008RTX]; Swiss National Science Foundation (SNF) [31003A_182318] Funding Source: Swiss National Science Foundation (SNF); Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [22K21352] Funding Source: KAKEN","JST, CREST, Japan(Core Research for Evolutional Science and Technology (CREST)); Swiss National Science Foundation(Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF)); Australia GRDC project; Swiss National Science Foundation (SNF)(Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF)); Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))","The authors would like to thank the staff of NBRP-Wheat, the field technical staff, and the members of the Laboratory of Plant Breeding, Graduate School of Agriculture, Kyoto University for supporting this study.

More people than ever-from artists, makers and entrepreneurs to educators and students-are connecting microcontrollers with sensors and actuators to create new interactive devices. However, physical computing still presents many challenges and demands many skills, spanning electronics, low-level protocols, and software-road blocks that reduce participation. While USB has made connecting peripherals to a personal computing device (PC) trivial, USB components are expensive and require a PC to operate. This makes USB impractical for many physical computing scenarios where cost, size and low power operation are often important. We introduce Jacdac, an open-source hardware and software platform that brings the user experience of USB to physical computing at a fraction of the cost and resource requirements. It combines an intuitive connector, standardized hardware and software interfaces, a simple bus-based protocol that runs on virtually any microcontroller, and integration with Microsoft MakeCode for the micro:bit. In this way, Jacdac provides a low-cost, extensible web-based plug-and-play experience for physical computing. We evaluated Jacdac in an international hackathon involving over 80 participants who built functional artifacts with Jacdac. Interviews reveal that users find Jacdac intuitive and appreciate the plug-and-play experience where sensors and actuators are automatically discovered by the web browser in real-time.","[Devine, James; Hodges, Steve] Microsoft, London, England; [Moskal, Michal; De Halleux, Peli; Ball, Thomas; D'Amone, Gabriele; Gakure, David; Finney, Joe] Microsoft, Redmond, WA USA; [Finney, Joe; Underwood, Lorraine; Hartley, Kobi; Oppenheim, Matt] Univ Lancaster, Lancaster, England; [Kos, Paul] Microsoft, Beijing, Peoples R China",Microsoft; Microsoft; Lancaster University,"Devine, J (corresponding author), Microsoft, London, England.",,"D'Amone, Gabriele/IQV-7791-2023","Underwood, Lorraine/0000-0002-8521-7094",EPSRC [EP/T022574/1] Funding Source: UKRI,EPSRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)),,,41,4,4,1,1,ASSOC COMPUTING MACHINERY,NEW YORK,"1601 Broadway, 10th Floor, NEW YORK, NY USA",,2474-9567,,PROC ACM INTERACT MO,Proc.

However, RES power inverters affect power quality, increase power losses, and, in certain cases, may cause power interruptions due to harmonics, deterioration of the rate of change of frequency, and inability to rapidly react in grid faults. Today, phasor measurement units (PMUs) are the ultimate tools for real-time monitoring of distribution grids' health, and they enable several data-driven added-value services such as fast and automated fault detection, isolation, and recovery; state estimation; power quality monitoring; dynamic events analysis, etc. The present paper proposes an open hardware and software PMU platform, which is low cost, high performance, expandable, and, in general, suitable for research and innovation activities.

In the RoboCup MSL, two teams of five autonomous robots play on an 18- x 12-m field. Equipped with sensors and on-board computers, each robot should be able to perceive the environment, make decision and control itself to play the soccer game autonomously. Design/methodology/approach - This paper presents the design of our soccer robots, participating in RoboCup MSL. The mechanical platform, electrical architecture and software framework are discussed separately. The mechanical platform is designed modularly, so easy maintainability is achieved; the electronic architecture is built on industrial standards using PC-based control technique, which results in high robustness and reliability during the intensive and fierce MSL games; the software is developed upon the open-source Robot Operating System (ROS); thus, the advantages of ROS such as modularity, portability and expansibility are inherited. Findings - Based on this paper and the open-source hardware and software, the MSL robots can be re-developed easily to participate in the RoboCup MSL. The robots can also be used in other research and education fields, especially for multi-robot systems and distributed artificial intelligence. Furthermore, the main designing ideas proposed in the paper, i.e. using a modular mechanical structure, an industrial electronic system and ROS-based software, provide a common solution for designing general intelligent robots. Originality/value - The methodology of the intelligent robot design for highly competitive and dynamic RoboCup MSL environments is proposed.","[Xiong, Dan; Xiao, Junhao; Lu, Huimin; Zeng, Zhiwen; Yu, Qinghua; Huang, Kaihong; Zheng, Zhiqiang] Natl Univ Def Technol, Coll Mechatron Engn & Automat, Changsha, Hunan, Peoples R China; [Yi, Xiaodong] Natl Univ Def Technol, Coll Comp, Changsha, Hunan, Peoples R China",National University of Defense Technology - China; National University of Defense Technology - China,"Xiao, JH (corresponding author), Natl Univ Def Technol, Coll Mechatron Engn & Automat, Changsha, Hunan, Peoples R China.",junhao.xiao@ieee.org,,"Xiao, Junhao/0000-0002-4751-539X",National Science Foundation of China [61403409]; Graduate School of National University of Defense Technology,National Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Graduate School of National University of Defense Technology,This work was supported by the Graduate School of National University of Defense Technology and National Science Foundation of China (No. 61403409).,,41,10,11,1,36,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0143-991X,1758-5791,,IND ROBOT,Ind.

OpenPMU achieves this through open-source hardware design specifications and software source code, allowing duplicates of the OpenPMU to be fabricated under open-source licenses. This paper presents the OpenPMU device based on the Labview development environment. The device is performance tested according to the IEEE C37.118.1 standard. Compatibility with the IEEE C37.118.2 messaging format is achieved through middleware which is readily adaptable to other PMU projects or applications.

There is an open area to develop and to build didactic modules to improve the learning process using experimentation in real physical systems. Particularly, a cart inverted pendulum is a classical physical system very commonly used in recent decades. We propose a cart inverted pendulum named MoDiCA-X as a low-cost didactic module with open source hardware and software. It is an electromechanical system feasible to build and easy to be modified. The mechanical parts of the module are 3D printed solids and can also be easily replicated. In terms of programming, the control applied to the system can be modified, since it uses C/C++ programming languages that are widely used in the academic community. The module is equipped with two very commercial sensors, are easy to install and to remove; both acquire the pendulum attitude and the car position. The actuators are four electric DC motors coupled to the car wheels to provide suitable velocity and torque to each axle independently. We validate the performance of the module by applying a multivariable linear quadratic regulator algorithm (LQR). (C) 2020 The Authors.

A 3-D printable, open-source colorimeter utilizing only open-source hardware and software solutions and readily available discrete components is discussed and its performance compared to a commercial portable colorimeter. Performance is evaluated with commercial vials prepared for the closed reflux chemical oxygen demand (COD) method. This approach reduced the cost of reliable closed reflux COD by two orders of magnitude making it an economic alternative for the vast majority of potential users. The open-source colorimeter demonstrated good reproducibility and serves as a platform for further development and derivation of the design for other, similar purposes such as nephelometry.

Different implementations are commercially available from the industry and yet there is quite an interest from the scientific community to spread its use to the majority of society by means of cost effectiveness and ease of use for solutions. These devices make the most sense when combined with unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), going a step further and alleviating repetitive routines which could be strenuous if traditional methods were adopted. In this work, a low cost and modular solution for a multispectral camera is presented, based on the use of a single panchromatic complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) sensor combined with a rotating wheel of interchangeable band pass optic filters. The system is compatible with open source hardware permitting one to capture, process, store and/or transmit data if needed. In addition, a calibration and characterization methodology has been developed for the camera, allowing not only for quantifying its performance, but also able to characterize other CMOS sensors in the market in order to select the one that best suits the budget and application. The process was experimentally validated by mounting the camera in a Dji Matrice 600 UAV to uncover vegetation indices in a reduced area of palm trees plantation.

These applications need new intelligent devices along heterogeneous networking. Which makes them costly to implement indeed. Platforms and open devices designed for open-source hardware are possible solutions. This research was conducted under an IoT design, implementation, and assessment model for the remote monitoring of pulse oximetry via oxygen partial saturation (SpO(2)) and heart rate (HR) with low-energy consumption. Methods: This study focused on the development of SpO(2) and HR measurements that will allow the monitoring and estimation in real time of the user's state and health related to the established parameters. Measurements were acquired and recorded using a remote web server that recorded the acquired variables for further processing. The statistical analysis data allows comparison of the registered data measured with theoretical models. Results: The IoT model was developed use Bluetooth low-energy devices, which comply with low-cost and open-hardware solutions operated via 'HTTP requests' for data transmission and reception from a cloud server to an edge device. Network performance assessment was conducted to guarantee the availability and integrity of the acquired values and signals. The system measured SpO(2) and HR variables. The most significant result was to achieve energy consumption 20% lower than that of devices in the market. Conclusions: In summary, the acquired data validation based on the IoT model had a transmission error of 0.001% which proves its applicability in healthcare.","[Ramirez Lopez, Leonardo Juan; Puerta Aponte, Gabriel] Univ Mil Nueva Granada, TIGUM Res Grp, Carrera 11 101-80, Bogota 110111481, Colombia; [Rodriguez Garcia, Arturo] Univ Santiago Chile, GINT Res Grp, Santiago, Chile",Universidad de Santiago de Chile,"Lopez, LJR (corresponding author), Univ Mil Nueva Granada, TIGUM Res Grp, Carrera 11 101-80, Bogota 110111481, Colombia.",leonardo.ramirez@unimilitar.edu.co,"LOPEZ, LEONARDO JUAN RAMIREZ/E-8930-2017; Rodriguez, Arturo/I-7205-2016","LOPEZ, LEONARDO JUAN RAMIREZ/0000-0002-6473-5685; Puerta, Gabriel/0000-0003-1730-170X; Rodriguez, Arturo/0000-0002-8383-6561",Office of the Vice Rector for Research at Universidad Militar Nueva Granada [INV-ING-2365],Office of the Vice Rector for Research at Universidad Militar Nueva Granada,This research has been funded by the Office of the Vice Rector for Research at Universidad Militar Nueva Granada (Project No. INV-ING-2365).,,25,21,22,1,13,KOREAN SOC MEDICAL INFORMATICS,SEOUL,"1618 KYUNGHEEGUNG ACHIM BLDG 3, 72 NAESOO-DONG CHONGRO-KU, SEOUL, 110-872, SOUTH KOREA",2093-3681,2093-369X,,HEALTHC INFORM RES,Healthc.

The use of Autonomous surface vehicles (ASV) have a promising role to revolutionize the transportation, monitorization, operation and maintenance areas, allowing to perform distinct task from offshore assets inspection to harbor patrolling. This work presents SENSE, an autonomouS vEssel for multi-domaiN inSpection and maintEnance. It provides an open-source hardware and software architecture that is easy to replicate for both research institutes and industry. This is a multi-purpose vehicle capable of acquiring multi-domain data for inspecting and reconstructing maritime infrastructures. SENSE provides a research platform which can increase the situational awareness capabilities for ASVs. SENSE full configuration provides multimodal sensory data acquired from both domains using a Light Detection And Ranging (LiDAR), a stereoscopic camera, and a multibeam echosounder. In addition, it supplies navigation information obtained from a real-time kinematic satellite navigation system and inertial measurement units. Moreover, the tests performed at the harbor of Marina de Leca, at Porto, Portugal, resulted in a dataset which captures a fully operational harbor. It illustrates several conditions on maritime scenarios, such as undocking and docking examples, crossings with other vehicles and distinct types of moored vessels. The data available represents both domains of the maritime scenario, being the first public dataset acquired for multi-domain observation using a single vehicle. This paper also provides examples of applications for navigation and inspection on multi-domain scenarios, such as odometry estimation, bathymetric surveying and multi-domain mapping.","[Campos, Daniel Filipe] Univ Porto, Fac Engn, P-4200465 Porto, Portugal; INESC TEC, Ctr Robot & Autonomous Syst, P-4200465 Porto, Portugal",Universidade do Porto; INESC TEC,"Campos, DF (corresponding author), Univ Porto, Fac Engn, P-4200465 Porto, Portugal.",daniel.f.campos@inesctec.pt,"Matos, Anibal/N-4350-2013","Matos, Anibal/0000-0002-9771-002X; Pinto, Andry Maykol Gomes/0000-0003-2465-5813; Campos, Daniel/0000-0002-3982-1856",Portuguese Government through the FCT-Foundation for Science and Technology [SFRH-BD-144263-2019]; ERDF-European Regional Development Fund through the Operational Program for Competitiveness and Internationalization-COMPETE 2020 Program; FCT [POCI-01-0145-FEDER-030010]; European Union [871571],Portuguese Government through the FCT-Foundation for Science and Technology(Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia (FCT)); ERDF-European Regional Development Fund through the Operational Program for Competitiveness and Internationalization-COMPETE 2020 Program; FCT(Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia (FCT)); European Union(European Union (EU)),"This work was supported in part by the Portuguese Government through the FCT~Foundation for Science and Technology within the Ph.D. Studentship to DC SFRH-BD-144263-2019, in part by the ERDF-European Regional Development Fund through the Operational Program for Competitiveness and Internationalization-COMPETE 2020 Program and FCT within Project POCI-01-0145-FEDER-030010 (DIIUS), and in part by the European Union's Horizon 2020-The EU Framework Program for Research and Innovation 2014~2020 under Grant 871571 (ATLANTIS).",,58,6,7,4,9,IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC,PISCATAWAY,"445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA",2169-3536,,,IEEE ACCESS,IEEE Access,,2022,10,,,,,,113355,113375,,10.1109/ACCESS.2022.3217504,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2022.3217504,,,21,"Computer Science, Information Systems; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Telecommunications",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Computer Science; Engineering; Telecommunications,5Y0RO,,gold,,,2024-08-15,WOS:000878999500001,,,,247

CTDs, devices that measure salinity (via conductivity), temperature, and depth in the ocean, are essential for almost all marine scientific research, whether oceanography, ecology, conservation, or management. But CTDs are often cost- prohibitive, making this essential tool of ocean science inaccessible to the majority of ocean knowledge seekers. The OpenCTD is a low-cost, open-source oceanographic instrument, built from relatively accessible components, that allows ocean knowledge seekers to collect data on salinity, temperature, and depth in waters as deep as 140 m, with depth accurate to <1 cm, temperature to +/- 0.1 degrees C, and a salinity error rate of 1%, with a 90% response time of 1 second. The OpenCTD is an open, adaptable platform that allows users to integrate other sensors (e.g., dissolved oxygen, pH) to fit their specific needs or questions. The utility of the OpenCTD for both STEM education and community oceanography is demonstrated in real-world case studies. The OpenCTD offers researchers, community groups, educators, managers, and other ocean knowledge seekers the ability to collect baseline data about their local waters at a fraction of the cost of commercial alternatives and, for most use cases, with comparable data quality.","[Thaler, Andrew] Univ Maryland, Ctr Environm Sci, Horn Point Lab, Cambridge, MD 21613 USA; [Thaler, Andrew] Blackbeard Biol Sci & Environm Advisors, St Michaels, MD 21663 USA; [Sturdivant, S.

However, the cost of acquisition and operation of sensor networks is still a limiting factor for their wide use. Under this scenario, low-cost and affordable open-source sensors and systems emerge as an alternative to research-grade instruments. To fulfill the quality requirements defined by international organizations, sensor calibration has to be performed and shall be considered as a basic requirement. Best monitoring practices including established quality control procedures should be implemented for gathering environmental data.

It is reasonable to concede that a collective, guided enterprise could serve to devise solid and substantial datasets, as a result of a collaborative effort, in the same sense as the open software community does. In this way datasets could be complemented, extended and expanded in size with, for example, more individuals, samples and human actions. For this to be possible some commitments must be made by the collaborators, being one of them sharing the same data acquisition platform. In this paper, we offer an affordable open source hardware and software platform based on inertial wearable sensors in a way that several groups could cooperate in the construction of datasets through common software suitable for collaboration. Some experimental results about the throughput of the overall system are reported showing the feasibility of acquiring data from up to 6 sensors with a sampling frequency no less than 118 Hz.

A better understanding of the mechanical properties of 3-D printing thermoplastics at cryogenic temperatures is essential to material selection, part design, and printing optimization. The goal of the present study was to explore the feasibility of development for a 3-D printed device ('CryoTensileDevice') to hold a test specimen in liquid nitrogen and be mounted in standard mechanical testing systems to evaluate 3-D printing material behaviors at cryogenic temperatures. The CryoTensileDevice was prototyped with flexible filaments with a per-unit material cost of <US$5 and a printing time of 5 h. The commonly used printing filament polylactic acid (PLA) was selected to evaluate the utility of the CryoTensileDevice. At room temperature, the CryoTensileDevice did not significantly (P 0.05) affect PLA tensile measurements such as Young's modulus, yield stress, yield strain, stress at break, or strain at break. With the CryoTensileDevice, specimens 3-D printed with PLA at 50%, 75%, and 100% infill rates had comparable tensile properties when tested at room and liquid nitrogen temperatures. The PLA showed superior performance in tensile properties in comparison to acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS). This device can assist characterization of 3-D printing approaches for cryogenic work, and opens a pathway for future innovations to create a variety of 3-D printed devices to study a wide range of material properties for cryogenic applications.","[Liu, Yue; Monroe, William T.] Louisiana State Univ, Dept Biol & Agr Engn, 163 EB Doran Bldg, Baton Rouge, LA 70803 USA; [Dong, Ju; Tiersch, Terrence R.; Wu, Qinglin] Louisiana State Univ, Sch Renewable Nat Resources, Agr Ctr, Baton Rouge, LA 70803 USA; [Tiersch, Terrence R.] Louisiana State Univ, Aquat Germplasm & Genet Resources Ctr, Sch Renewable Nat Resources, Agr Ctr, Baton Rouge, LA 70820 USA",Louisiana State University System; Louisiana State University; Louisiana State University System; Louisiana State University; Louisiana State University System; Louisiana State University,"Monroe, WT (corresponding author), Louisiana State Univ, Dept Biol & Agr Engn, 163 EB Doran Bldg, Baton Rouge, LA 70803 USA.",tmonroe@lsu.edu,"Wu, Qing-Lin/A-2727-2015",,"National Institutes of Health, Office of Research Infrastructure Programs [R24OD010441, R24-OD028443]; National Institute of Food and Agriculture, United States Department of Agriculture [LAB94420, NC1194]; Louisiana State University Research & Technology Foundation [AG-2018-LIFT003]; LSU-ACRES (Audubon Center for Research of Endangered Species) Collaborative Program; NIH Office of the Director [R24OD028443] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER","National Institutes of Health, Office of Research Infrastructure Programs; National Institute of Food and Agriculture, United States Department of Agriculture(United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)); Louisiana State University Research & Technology Foundation; LSU-ACRES (Audubon Center for Research of Endangered Species) Collaborative Program; NIH Office of the Director(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH Office of the Director)","This work was supported in part by funding from the National Institutes of Health, Office of Research Infrastructure Programs (R24OD010441 and R24-OD028443), with additional support provided by the National Institute of Food and Agriculture, United States Department of Agriculture (Hatch project LAB94420 and NC1194), the Louisiana State University Research & Technology Foundation (AG-2018-LIFT003), and the LSU-ACRES (Audubon Center for Research of Endangered Species) Collaborative Program.",,31,6,7,1,8,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0011-2275,1879-2235,,CRYOGENICS,Cryogenics,JAN,2022,121,,,,,,,,103409,10.1016/j.cryogenics.2021.103409,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cryogenics.2021.103409,,Dec 2021,8,"Thermodynamics; Physics, Applied",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Thermodynamics; Physics,XU6UV,36779016.0,"Bronze, Green Accepted",,,2024-08-15,WOS:000734398100003,,,,251

The challenge is to consider all of the different structures and components available and build the optimal power management on a microscale. The purpose of this paper is to streamline the design process by creating a novel reconfigurable testbed called Medlay. First, we propose a uniform interface for management functions e.g., power conversion, energy storing and power routing. This interface results in a clear layout because power and status pins are strictly separated, and inputs and outputs have fixed positions. Medlay is the ready-to-use and open-hardware platform based on the interface. It consists of a base board and small modules incorporating e.g., dc-dc converters, power switches and supercapacitors. Measurements confirm that Medlay represents a system on one circuit board, as parasitic effects of the interconnections are negligible. The versatility regarding different setups on the testbed is determined to over 250,000 combinations by layout graph grammar. Lastly, we underline the applicability by recreating three state-of-the-art systems with the testbed. In conclusion, Medlay facilitates building and testing power management in a very compact, clear and extensible fashion.","[Kokert, Jan; Beckedahl, Tobias; Reindl, Leonhard M.] Univ Freiburg, Dept Microsyst Engn IMTEK, Lab Elect Instrumentat, Georges Kohler Allee 106, D-79110 Freiburg, Germany",University of Freiburg,"Kokert, J (corresponding author), Univ Freiburg, Dept Microsyst Engn IMTEK, Lab Elect Instrumentat, Georges Kohler Allee 106, D-79110 Freiburg, Germany.",jan.kokert@imtek.uni-freiburg.de; becksed@googlemail.com; reindl@imtek.uni-freiburg.de,"Reindl, Leonhard/AAH-3274-2020","Reindl, Leonhard/0000-0002-5068-8929","Ministry of Science, Research and Arts of Baden-Wurttemberg, Germany; German Research Foundation (DFG); University of Freiburg","Ministry of Science, Research and Arts of Baden-Wurttemberg, Germany; German Research Foundation (DFG)(German Research Foundation (DFG)); University of Freiburg","This work was financially supported by the Ministry of Science, Research and Arts of Baden-Wurttemberg, Germany.

This is performed thanks to the design of a methodology of using a thermal simulation tool with experimental measurements based on a low-cost open source hardware platform in order to evaluate the energy saving measures and analyse the thermal comfort and energy savings. To accomplish this, a study of the housing needs is performed a priori to later design the different actions in the rehabilitation, using if possible, ecological materials in its development. Basically, walls and ceilings are insulated, three solar air collectors are included to heat the air ventilation and decrease the heating demand, and two pellet stoves are installed. Finally, the refurbished house is modeled and simulated in EnergyPlus and compared with the indoor air temperature and relative humidity measurements, made using an Open-Source Monitoring System (OSMS) developed for this research in Arduino, obtaining results with no significant differences without the need to calibrate the system. The results of thermal comfort, heating and cooling demand and heating energy consumption of the house before and after the renovation are compared providing a decrease in thermal demand of 66% and a decrease in heating energy consumption of 50% in the winter season, where 60% of the energy consumed is contributed from renewable sources. In terms of thermal comfort, the comparison of the PPD and PMV values shows an improvement in the house in heating and cooling season.","[Ghoreishi, Kusha] Quark Arquitectura SL, Ave Las Palmeras S-N, Benalmadena 29630, Spain; [Ghoreishi, Kusha; Fernandez-Gutierrez, Alberto; Parras, Luis] Univ Malaga, Escuela Ingn Ind, C Doctor Pedro Ortiz Ramos S-N, E-29071 Malaga, Spain; [Fernandez-Hernandez, Francisco] EII Univ Malaga, Energy Res Grp, C Doctor Pedro Ortiz Ramos S-N, Malaga 29071, Spain",Universidad de Malaga,"Fernández-Hernández, F (corresponding author), EII Univ Malaga, Energy Res Grp, C Doctor Pedro Ortiz Ramos S-N, Malaga 29071, Spain.",franciscofh@uma.es,"Parras, Luis/AAG-5863-2021; Fernandez, Francisco/Q-4911-2019; Fernandez Hernandez, Francisco/E-2862-2015; Parras, Luis/B-7223-2016","Fernandez, Francisco/0000-0002-5074-1507; Fernandez Hernandez, Francisco/0000-0002-5074-1507; Fernandez Gutierrez, Alberto/0000-0002-2234-4272; Parras, Luis/0000-0002-5592-3465",,,,,39,11,11,1,14,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",,2352-7102,,J BUILD ENG,J.

However, the signal processing and audiological research needed to address these problems has long been hampered by proprietary development systems, underpowered embedded processors, and the difficulty of performing tests in real-world acoustical environments. To facilitate existing research in hearing healthcare and enable new investigations beyond what is currently possible, we have developed a modern, open-source hearing research platform, Open Speech Platform (OSP). This paper presents the system design of the complete OSP wearable platform, from hardware through firmware and software to user applications. The platform provides a complete suite of basic and advanced hearing aid features which can be adapted by researchers. It serves web apps directly from a hotspot on the wearable hardware, enabling users and researchers to control the system in real time. In addition, it can simultaneously acquire high-quality electroencephalography (EEG) or other electrophysiological signals closely synchronized to the audio. All of these features are provided in a wearable form factor with enough battery life for hours of operation in the field.","[Pisha, Louis; Lee, Ching-Hua; Mercier, Patrick P.; Rao, Bhaskar D.] Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Warchall, Julian] Booz Allen Hamilton, Arlington, VA 22203 USA; [Zubatiy, Tamara] Georgia Inst Technol, Sch Interact Comp, Atlanta, GA 30332 USA; [Hamilton, Sean; Gupta, Rajesh] Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Comp Sci & Engn, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Chockalingam, Ganz; Garudadri, Harinath] Univ Calif San Diego, Qualcomm Inst, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Gupta, Rajesh] Halicioglu Data Sci Inst, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA",University of California System; University of California San Diego; Booz Allen Hamilton Holding Corporation; University System of Georgia; Georgia Institute of Technology; University of California System; University of California San Diego; University of California System; University of California San Diego,"Pisha, L (corresponding author), Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA.",lpisha@eng.ucsd.edu,"Lee, Ching-Hua/AAE-7523-2021","Gupta, Rajesh/0000-0002-6489-7633; Garudadri, Harinath/0000-0003-0456-0956; Lee, Ching-Hua/0000-0001-6116-3653; Pisha, Louis A/0000-0001-5307-4263; Mercier, Patrick/0000-0003-1488-5076","National Institute of Health/National Institute on Deafness and Other communication Disorders (NIH/NIDCD) [R21DC015046, R33DC015046]; NIH/NIDCD [R01DC015436]; U.S. Army Research Laboratory [W911QX-16-C-0003]; National Science Foundation [DGE-114086]; National Science Foundation Division of Information & Intelligent Systems [IIS-1838830]",National Institute of Health/National Institute on Deafness and Other communication Disorders (NIH/NIDCD); NIH/NIDCD(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute on Deafness & Other Communication Disorders (NIDCD)); U.S. Army Research Laboratory(United States Department of DefenseUS Army Research Laboratory (ARL)); National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); National Science Foundation Division of Information & Intelligent Systems,"This work was supported in part by the National Institute of Health/National Institute on Deafness and Other communication Disorders (NIH/NIDCD) under Grant R21DC015046 and Grant R33DC015046, ""Self-fitting of Amplification: Methodology and Candidacy,"" in part by the NIH/NIDCD under Grant R01DC015436, ""A Real-time, Open, Portable, Extensible, Speech Lab,"" in part by the U.S. Army Research Laboratory under Contract W911QX-16-C-0003, in part by the National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship under Grant DGE-114086, and in part by the National Science Foundation Division of Information & Intelligent Systems under Grant IIS-1838830, ""A Framework for Optimizing Hearing Aids In Situ Based on Patient Feedback, Auditory Context, and Audiologist Input.""",,68,8,13,0,8,IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC,PISCATAWAY,"445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA",2169-3536,,,IEEE ACCESS,IEEE Access,,2019,7,,,,,,162083,162101,,10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2951145,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2951145,,,19,"Computer Science, Information Systems; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Telecommunications",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Computer Science; Engineering; Telecommunications,JN8VQ,32547893.0,"Green Accepted, Green Submitted, gold",,,2024-08-15,WOS:000497169800092,,,,254

Currently, as no commercial continuum robot platform is available, a large variety of early-stage prototypes exists. These prototypes are developed by individual research groups and are often used for a single publication. Thus, a significant amount of time is devoted to creating proprietary hardware and software hindering the development of a common platform, and shifting away scarce time and efforts from the main research challenges. We address this problem by proposing an open-source actuation module, which can be used to build different types of continuum robots. It consists of a high-torque brushless electric motor, a high resolution optical encoder, and a low-gear-ratio transmission. For this article, we create three different types of continuum robots. In addition, we illustrate, for the first time, that continuum robots built with our actuation module can proprioceptively detect external forces. Consequently, our approach opens untapped and under-investigated research directions related to the dynamics and advanced control of continuum robots, where sensing the generalized flow and effort is mandatory. Besides that, we democratize continuum robots research by providing open-source software and hardware with our initiative called the Open Continuum Robotics Project, to increase the accessibility and reproducibility of advanced methods.","[Grassmann, Reinhard M.; Shentu, Chengnan; Hamoda, Taqi; Dewi, Puspita Triana; Burgner-Kahrs, Jessica] Univ Toronto, Dept Math Computat Sci, Continuum Robot Lab, Mississauga, ON, Canada",University of Toronto,"Grassmann, RM (corresponding author), Univ Toronto, Dept Math Computat Sci, Continuum Robot Lab, Mississauga, ON, Canada.",reinhard.grassmann@utoronto.ca,,,Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada10.13039/501100000038,Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada10.13039/501100000038,"The original version of this article, prior to peer review, can be found as a preprint here (Grassmann et al., 2023).",,39,3,3,13,14,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,LAUSANNE,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",2296-9144,,,FRONT ROBOT AI,Front.

Such systems often require to be multi-modal and multi-channel capable of acquiring and processing several different types of physiological signals simultaneously in realtime. Developments of modular and scalable electrophysiological data acquisition systems for experimental research enhance understanding and progress in the field. To contribute to such an endeavor, we present an open-source hardware project called High-Channel Count Electrophysiology or HiCCE, targeting to produce an easily-adaptable, cost-effective, and affordable electrophysiological acquisition system as an alternative solution for mostly available commercial tools and the current state of the art in the field. In this paper, we describe the design and validation of the entire chain of the HiCCE-128 electrophysiological data acquisition system. The system comprises of 128 independent channels capable of acquiring signal at 31.25 kHz, with 16 effective bits per channel with a measured noise level of about 3 fiV. The reliability and feasibility of the implemented system have been confirmed through a series of tests and real-world applications. The modular design methodology based on the FPGA Mezzanine Card (FMC) standard allows the connection of the HiCCE-128 board to programmable system-on-chip carrier devices through the high-speed FMC link.

The system is based on an open-source ARDUINO microcontroller-board, programmed in a simple integrated development environment (IDE). Low cost high-frequency dielectric probes were used in the platform and lab tested on three non-saline soils (ECe1: 2.5 < 0.1 mS/cm). Empirical calibration curves were subjected to cross-validation (leave-one-out method), and normalized root mean square error (NRMSE) were respectively 0.09 for the overall model, 0.09 for the sandy soil, 0.07 for the clay loam and 0.08 for the sandy loam. The overall model (pooled soil data) fitted the data very well (R-2 = 0.89) showing a high stability, being able to generate very similar RMSEs during training and validation (RMSEtraining = 2.63; RMSEvalidation = 2.61).

A promising technology for the safe and efficient collection of monitoring data is a compact autonomous surface vehicle (ASV), capable of autonomous navigation along a predefined trajectory based on geographic coordinates and measurements in different places and depths. In this practical paper, the development process, technical details and functional testing results of a low-cost ASV for WSP monitoring are presented. Commonly available construction materials and electronic components were used to ensure affordability and reparability. The access to online tutorials and peer-support was crucial for assembling the open-source autopilot and data logger.

In this study, we designed and built a multifunction fluorescent open source in vivo/in vitro imaging system (openIVIS) system that integrates a Raspberry Pi with commercial cameras and LEDs with 3D printed structures combined with an acrylic housing. Our openIVIS provides three excitation wavelengths of 460 nm, 520 nm, and 630 nm integrated with Python control software to enable fluorescent measurements across the full visible light spectrum. To demonstrate the potential applications of our system, we tested its performance against a diverse set of experiments including laboratory assays (measuring fluorescent dyes, using optical nanosensors, and DNA gel electrophoresis) to potentially fieldable applications (plant and mineral imaging). We also tested the potential use for a high school biology environment by imaging small animals and tracking their development over the course of ten days. Our system demonstrated its ability to measure a wide dynamic range fluorescent response from millimolar to picomolar concentrations in the same sample while measuring responses across visible wavelengths. These results demonstrate the power and flexibility of open-source hardware and software and how it can be integrated with customizable manufacturing to create low-cost scientific instruments with a wide range of applications. Our study provides a promising model for the development of low-cost instruments that can be used in both research and education.","[Branning Jr, John M.; Bell, Grant J.; Cash, Kevin J.] Colorado Sch Mines, Quantitat Biosci & Engn, Golden, CO 80401 USA; [Branning Jr, John M.] MITRE Corp, Bedford, MA USA; [Faughnan, Kealy A.; Isbell, Sydney M.; Cash, Kevin J.] Colorado Sch Mines, Chem & Biol Engn Dept, Golden, CO 80401 USA; [Tomson, Austin A.; Kilroy, Kramer; Smith, Michael] Colorado Sch Mines, Mech Engn, Golden, CO USA; [Degroot, Allen; Jameson, Lydia; Smith, Robert] Colorado Sch Mines, Elect Engn, Golden, CO 80401 USA; [Mottel, Landon] Arvada West High Sch, Arvada, CO USA; [Branning, Elizabeth G.] Colorado Early Coll Castle Rock, Castle Rock, CO USA; [Worrall, Zoe; Anderson, Frances; Panditaradyula, Ashrit; Yang, William; Abdelmalek, Joseph; Brake, Joshua] Harvey Mudd Coll, Dept Engn, Claremont, CA USA",Colorado School of Mines; MITRE Corporation; Colorado School of Mines; Colorado School of Mines; Colorado School of Mines; Claremont Colleges; Harvey Mudd College,"Cash, KJ (corresponding author), Colorado Sch Mines, Quantitat Biosci & Engn, Golden, CO 80401 USA.; Cash, KJ (corresponding author), Colorado Sch Mines, Chem & Biol Engn Dept, Golden, CO 80401 USA.",kcash@mines.edu,,"Bell, Grant/0000-0002-9296-2332","Chan Zuckerberg Initiative DAF [2022-251273, 2022-251322]; Silicon Valley Community Foundation; National Institutes of Health [R15GM140443]; MITRE Corporation",Chan Zuckerberg Initiative DAF(Chan Zuckerberg Initiative (CZI)); Silicon Valley Community Foundation; National Institutes of Health(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA); MITRE Corporation,"This project has been made possible in part by grant numbers 2022-251273 to KJC and 2022-251322 to JB from the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative DAF, https://chanzuckerberg.com/, an advised fund of Silicon Valley Community Foundation, by the National Institutes of Health, https://www.nih.gov/, under Award Number R15GM140443 to KJC, and by The MITRE Corporation, https://www.mitre.org/, under their Advanced Graduate Degree Program.

Therefore, and considering that COVID-19 generally causes damage to the respiratory system (in the form of lung infection), it is essential to ensure the best pulmonary ventilation for the patient. However, depending on the severity of the disease and the health condition of the patient, the situation can become critical when the patient has respiratory distress or becomes unable to breathe on his/her own. In that case, the ventilator becomes the lifeline of the patient. This device must keep patients stable until, on their own or with the help of medications, they manage to overcome the lung infection. However, with thousands or hundreds of thousands of infected patients, no country has enough ventilators. If this situation has become critical in the Global North, it has turned disastrous in developing countries, where ventilators are even more scarce. This article shows the race against time of a multidisciplinary research team at the University of Huelva, UHU, southwest of Spain, to develop an inexpensive, multifunctional, and easy-to-manufacture ventilator, which has been named ResUHUrge.

These are essentially cheap, easy-to-handle systems, offering rapid sample-to-answer results to non-technical operators. In this perspective, we do not review all the current advances of Lab-on-a-chip techniques for the realisation of PoC. Instead, we aim to provide insight into what we foresee as the three most important factors to play the essential roles for succeeding in making commercially viable PoC pathogen-detection devices. The three insights are namely: the utilizations of (i) disposable polymer (microfluidic) chips, (ii) the implementation of surface-bound (or solid-phase) nucleic-acid amplification techniques and (iii) relying (more) on open-source hardware and software.

Here we present a novel easy-to-use open-source gravity-chuck type spin coater with minimal points of failure at a material cost of around 100 USD (1500 ZAR). The unique chuck design makes use of interchangeable brass plate sample masks, each specific to a sample size, these can be made with basic skills and common hand tools. In comparison, replacement chucks for commercial alternatives can cost as much as the entire spin coater we present.

These self-replicating rapid prototypers (RepRaps) can manufacture approximately half of their own parts from sequential fused deposition of polymer feedstocks. RepRaps have been demonstrated for conventional prototyping and engineering, customizing scientific equipment, and appropriate technology-related manufacturing for sustainable development. However, in order for this technology to proliferate like 2-D electronic printers have, it must be economically viable for a typical household. This study reports on the life-cycle economic analysis (LCEA) of RepRap technology for an average US household. A new low-cost RepRap is described and the costs of materials and time to construct it are quantified. The economic costs of a selection of 20 open-source printable designs (representing less than 0.02% of those available), are typical of products that a household might purchase, are quantified for print time, energy, and filament consumption and compared to low and high Internet market prices for similar products without shipping costs. The results show that even making the extremely conservative assumption that the household would only use the printer to make the selected 20 products a year the avoided purchase cost savings would range from about $300 to $2000/year. Assuming the 25 h of necessary printing for the selected products is evenly distributed throughout the year these savings provide a simple payback time for the RepRap in 4 months to 2 years and provide an ROI between >200% and >40%. As both upgrades and the components that are most likely to wear out in the RepRap can be printed and thus the lifetime of the distributing manufacturing can be substantially increased the unavoidable conclusion from this study is that the RepRap is an economically attractive investment for the average US household already. It appears clear that as RepRaps improve in reliability, continue to decline in cost and both the number and assumed utility of open-source designs continues growing exponentially, open-source 3-D printers will become a mass-market mechatronic device.

Here, we present three contributions towards making the field of acoustic holography more widespread. Firstly, we introduce an iterative algorithm that accurately calculates the amplitudes and phases of an array of ultrasound emitters in order to create a target amplitude field in mid-air. Secondly, we use the algorithm to analyse the impact of spatial, amplitude and phase emission resolution on the resulting acoustic field, thus providing engineering insights towards array design. For example, we show an onset of diminishing returns for smaller than a quarter-wavelength sized emitters and a phase and amplitude resolution of eight and four divisions per period, respectively. Lastly, we present a hardware platform for the generation of acoustic holograms. The array is integrated in a single board composed of 256 emitters operating at 40 kHz. We hope that the results and procedures described within this paper enable researchers to build their own ultrasonic arrays and explore novel applications of ultrasonic holograms.","[Morales, Rafael] UltraLeap Ltd, Bristol BS2 0EL, Avon, England; [Ezcurdia, Inigo; Irisarri, Josu; Marzo, Asier] Univ Publ Navarra, UpnaLab, Pamplona 31006, Spain; [Andrade, Marco A.

This article describes a low-cost and open-source hardware architecture able to detect the indoor variables necessary for the IEQ calculation as an alternative to the traditional hardware used for this purpose. The system consists of some sensors and an Arduino board. One of the key strengths of Arduino is the possibility it affords of loading the script into the board's memory and letting it run without interfacing with computers, thus granting complete independence, portability and accuracy. Recent works have demonstrated that the cost of scientific equipment can be reduced by applying open-source principles to their design using a combination of the Arduino platform and a 3D printer. The evolution of the 3D printer has provided a new means of open design capable of accelerating self-directed development.

However, their computational demands are also growing, which constraints their use in mobile and time-sensitive robots. Biological vision presents a well known practical solution. Specifically, primates limit the computational demands of vision by processing only small parts of the scene in detail, and frequently reorienting the eyes to different locations. Artificial vision is much more power-intensive than biological vision, so this strategy is likely to be increasingly relevant to robots, as they become more visually sophisticated. To facilitate progress and reduce duplication of work in this area, we have developed a 7-degree-of-freedom robotic head that supports such rapid saccade-like camera movements, and we are releasing the design files under an open-hardware license. The system supports C-mount cameras, large foveated lenses, and liquid lenses that allow rapid changes in focus distance. It also has a stereo baseline that is roughly the same as that of humans, to support stereo processing of nearby objects in grasping and manipulation tasks. The main contributions of this work are the mechanical design, and the demonstration that its stereo baseline, range of motion, and saccade velocity are similar to those of primate systems. The main general advantages over existing robotic heads are speed and the open-hardware license. The system would also be an ideal platform for future research that aims to replicate the performance of primate vision systems.","[Huber, Scott] Axcendo Innovat Corp, Toronto, ON M6H 1B5, Canada; [Selby, Ben; Tripp, Bryan] Univ Waterloo, Dept Syst Design Engn, Waterloo, ON N2G 3G1, Canada",University of Waterloo,"Tripp, B (corresponding author), Univ Waterloo, Dept Syst Design Engn, Waterloo, ON N2G 3G1, Canada.",scott@axcendo.com; bselby@uwaterloo.ca; bptripp@uwaterloo.ca,,"Tripp, Bryan/0000-0002-2150-297X",Canadian Foundation for Innovation; Research Infrastructure grant from the Ontario Research Fund; Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada; Axcendo Innovation Corporation,Canadian Foundation for Innovation(Canada Foundation for Innovation); Research Infrastructure grant from the Ontario Research Fund; Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada(Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)CGIAR); Axcendo Innovation Corporation,"This work was supported in part by a Leaders' Opportunity Fund grant from the Canadian Foundation for Innovation, in part by the Research Infrastructure grant from the Ontario Research Fund, in part by the Discovery Grant from the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada, and in part by the Axcendo Innovation Corporation.",,35,1,1,0,10,IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC,PISCATAWAY,"445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA",2377-3766,,,IEEE ROBOT AUTOM LET,IEEE Robot.

Modernization of conventional weather radars is now possible within a small budget using open hardware and software architectures. Our Primary Processor ""ELBRUS"" (Signal Processor + Radar Controller) makes use of available computer cards and commercial PC systems. The system architecture was designed with a particular stress on software. All functions that could be handled within the Data Acquisition Computer have been put there. Also, a versatile Product Generator and Processing System were developed. Vests processor Vesta RPG and its front end application Vesta\Process deal with product and composite generation, data base management and web server links. They function in a server-client fashion using standard protocols.

This is especially true if we are to gain insights into one of the least studied aspects: the potential perturbations that neurotoxicants can have on cognitive behaviors. The paucity of experimental data is partly caused by a lack of low-cost technologies for the analysis of higher-level neurological functions (e.g., associative learning) in small aquatic organisms. Here, we present a proof-of-concept prototype that utilizes a new real-time animal tracking software for on-the-fly video analysis and closed-loop, external hardware communications to deliver stimuli based on specific behaviors in aquatic organisms, spanning three animal phyla: chordates (fish, frog), platyhelminthes (flatworm), and arthropods (crustacean). The system's open-source software features an intuitive graphical user interface and advanced adaptive threshold-based image segmentation for precise animal detection. We demonstrate the precision of animal tracking across multiple aquatic species with varying modes of locomotion. The presented technology interfaces easily with low-cost and open-source hardware such as the Arduino microcontroller family for closed-loop stimuli control. The new system has potential future applications in eco-neurotoxicology, where it could enable new opportunities for cognitive research in diverse small aquatic model organisms.","[Bai, Yutao; Henry, Jason; Wlodkowic, Donald] RMIT Univ, Sch Sci, Neurotoxicol Lab, Melbourne, Vic 3083, Australia; [Cheng, Eva; Perry, Stuart] Univ Technol Sydney, Fac Engn & IT, Sch Elect & Data Engn, Sydney, NSW 2007, Australia; [Mawdsley, David] Def Sci & Technol Grp, Melbourne, Vic 3207, Australia; [Wong, Bob B.

IEEE 754-2019 compliant (floating-point) arithmetic is the de facto standard for performing these computations. Recently, posit-arithmetic has been proposed as a drop-in replacement for floating-point arithmetic. The posit data representation and arithmetic claim several advantages over the floating-point format and arithmetic, including higher dynamic range, better accuracy, and superior performance-area trade-offs. However, very few accessible and holistic frameworks facilitate the validation of these claims of posit-arithmetic, especially with long accumulations (quire).We present a consolidated general-purpose processor-based framework to support posit-arithmetic empiri-cism. Users can seamlessly experiment using posit and floating-point arithmetic in their applications since the framework is designed for the two number systems to coexist. Melodica is a posit-arithmetic core that implements parametric fused operations on the quire data type. Clarinet is a Melodica-enabled processor based on the RISC-V ISA. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first-ever integration of the quire in a RISC-V core. We report results from application studies on Clarinet and benchmark common linear algebra and computer vision kernels. We synthesize Clarinet on a Xilinx FPGA and present utilization and timing data.

This ability requires the nervous system to undergo adjustments at distinct temporal scales, from short-term dynamic changes in expression of neurotransmitters and receptors to longer-term growth, spatial and connectivity reorganization, while integrating external stimuli. The nematode Caenorhabditis elegans provides a model of nervous system plasticity, in particular its dauer exit decision. Under unfavorable conditions, larvae will enter the non-feeding and non-reproductive stress-resistant dauer stage and adapt their behavior to cope with the harsh new environment, with active reversal under improved conditions leading to resumption of reproductive development. However, how different environmental stimuli regulate the exit decision mechanism and thereby drive the larva's behavioral change is unknown. To fill this gap and provide insights on behavioral changes over extended periods of time, we developed a new open hardware method for long-term imaging (12h) of C. elegans larvae.Results: Our WormObserver platform comprises open hardware and software components for video acquisition, automated processing of large image data (> 80k images/experiment) and data analysis. We identified dauer-specific behavioral motifs and characterized the behavioral trajectory of dauer exit in different environments and genetic backgrounds to identify key decision points and stimuli promoting dauer exit. Combining long-term behavioral imaging with transcriptomics data, we find that bacterial ingestion triggers a change in neuropeptide gene expression to establish post-dauer behavior.Conclusions: Taken together, we show how a developing nervous system can robustly integrate environmental changes activate a developmental switch and adapt the organism's behavior to a new environment. WormObserver is generally applicable to other research questions within and beyond the C. elegans field, having a modular and customizable character and allowing assessment of behavioral plasticity over longer periods.","[Preusser, Friedrich; Neuschulz, Anika; Junker, Jan Philipp; Rajewsky, Nikolaus] Max Delbruck Ctr Mol Med Helmholtz Assoc MDC, Berlin Inst Med Syst Biol BIMSB, D-10115 Berlin, Germany; [Preusser, Friedrich; Neuschulz, Anika] Humboldt Univ, Inst Biol, D-10099 Berlin, Germany; [Preibisch, Stephan] Howard Hughes Med Inst, Janelia Res Campus, Ashburn, VA 20147 USA",Helmholtz Association; Max Delbruck Center for Molecular Medicine; Humboldt University of Berlin; Howard Hughes Medical Institute,"Preusser, F (corresponding author), Humboldt Univ, Inst Biol, D-10099 Berlin, Germany.; Preibisch, S (corresponding author), Howard Hughes Med Inst, Janelia Res Campus, Ashburn, VA 20147 USA.",flpreusser@gmail.com; preibischs@janelia.hhmi.org,"Neuschulz, Anika/KWU-7581-2024; Junker, Jan Philipp/A-9754-2010","Neuschulz, Anika/0000-0001-6163-3344; Preibisch, Stephan/0000-0002-0276-494X; Preusser, Friedrich/0000-0001-8231-2195; Junker, Jan Philipp/0000-0002-2826-8290",HFSP; Studienstiftung des deutschen Volkes; MDC-Berlin; ERC starting grant SPACEVAR; HHMI Janelia;  [RGP0021/2018-102],HFSP(Human Frontier Science Program); Studienstiftung des deutschen Volkes; MDC-Berlin; ERC starting grant SPACEVAR(European Research Council (ERC)); HHMI Janelia;,F.P. was funded by a PhD fellowship from Studienstiftung des deutschen Volkes and MDC-Berlin.

In addition, 11 people took part in an experiment in which they had to implement several exercises and complete a usability test. Sampling rates under 250 Hz (typical for many biomedical applications) makes it feasible to implement filters, sliding windows and Fourier analysis, operating in real time. Participants rated software usability at 70.2 out of 100 and the ease of use when implementing several signal processing applications was rated at just over 4.4 out of 5. Participants showed their intention of using this software because it was percieved as useful and very easy to use. The performances of the library showed that it may be appropriate for implementing small biomedical real-time applications or for human movement monitoring, even in a simple open-source hardware device like Arduino Genuino.

However, affordable tools are often constrained to short-term studies due to high energy consumption and limited storage. To enable long-term monitoring, energy and space efficiency must be improved on such tools. This paper describes the development and deployment of three acoustic detection algorithms that reduce the power and storage requirements of acoustic monitoring on affordable, open-source hardware. The algorithms aim to detect bat echolocation, to search for evidence of an endangered cicada species, and also to collect evidence of poaching in a protected nature reserve. The algorithms are designed to run on AudioMoth: a low-cost, open-source acoustic monitoring device, developed by the authors and widely adopted by the conservation community. Each algorithm addresses a detection task of increasing complexity, implementing extra analytical steps to account for environmental conditions such as wind, analysing samples multiple times to prevent missed events, and incorporating a hidden Markov model for sample classification in both the time and frequency domain. For each algorithm, we report on real-world deployments carried out with partner organisations and also benchmark the hidden Markov model against a convolutional neural network, a deep-learning technique commonly used for acoustics. The deployments demonstrate how acoustic detection algorithms extend the use of low-cost, open-source hardware and facilitate a new avenue for conservation researchers to perform large-scale monitoring.","[Prince, Peter; Hill, Andrew] Univ Southampton, Sch Elect & Comp Sci, Southampton SO17 1BJ, Hants, England; [Covarrubias, Evelyn Pina; Doncaster, Patrick] Univ Southampton, Sch Biol Sci, Southampton SO17 1BJ, Hants, England; [Snaddon, Jake L.] Univ Southampton, Sch Geog & Environm Sci, Southampton SO17 1BJ, Hants, England; [Rogers, Alex] Univ Oxford, Dept Comp Sci, Oxford OX1 2JD, England",University of Southampton; University of Southampton; University of Southampton; University of Oxford,"Prince, P (corresponding author), Univ Southampton, Sch Elect & Comp Sci, Southampton SO17 1BJ, Hants, England.",pcp1g11@soton.ac.uk; ah1u14@soton.ac.uk; e.pinacovarrubias@soton.ac.uk; cpd@soton.ac.uk; j.l.snaddon@soton.ac.uk; alex.rogers@cs.ox.ac.uk,"Doncaster, C.

This novel experimental approach allows the application of the following stimuli to an ex vivo vessel in a physiological bath: (a) a realistic intravascular pressure waveform defined by the user; (b) shear stress in the endothelial layer since, in addition to the pressure waveform, the flow through the vessel can be independently controlled by the user; (c) conditions of hypo/hyperoxia and hypo/hypercapnia in an intravascular circulating medium. These stimuli can be applied alone or in different combinations to study possible synergistic or antagonistic effects. The setting performance is illustrated by a proof of concept in an ex vivo rabbit aorta. The experimental setting is easy to build by using very low-cost materials widely available.

One area that requires improved supply chain resilience and that is of particular importance to electronic designers is the shortage of basic dual in-line package (DIP) electronic components commonly used for prototyping. This anecdotal observation was investigated as a case study of using additive manufacturing to enforce contact between premade, off-the-shelf conductors to allow for electrical continuity between two arbitrary points by examining data relating to the stock quantity of electronic components, extracted from Digi-Key Electronics. This study applies this concept using an open hardware approach for the design, testing, and use of a simple, parametric, 3-D printable invention that allows for small outline integrated circuit (SOIC) components to be used in DIP package circuits (i.e., breadboards, protoboards, etc.). The additive manufacture breakout board (AMBB) design was developed using two different open-source modelers, OpenSCAD and FreeCAD, to provide reliable and consistent electrical contact between the component and the rest of the circuit and was demonstrated with reusable 8-SOIC to DIP breakout adapters. The three-part design was optimized for manufacturing with RepRap-class fused filament 3-D printers, making the AMBB a prime candidate for use in distributed manufacturing models. The AMBB offers increased flexibility during circuit prototyping by allowing arbitrary connections between the component and prototyping interface as well as superior organization through the ability to color-code different component types. The cost of the AMBB is CAD $0.066/unit, which is a 94% saving compared to conventional PCB-based breakout boards. Use of the AMBB device can provide electronics designers with an increased selection of components for through-hole use by more than a factor of seven. Future development of AMBB devices to allow for low-cost conversion between arbitrary package types provides a path towards more accessible and inclusive electronics design as well as faster prototyping and technical innovation.","[Brooks, Cameron K.; Pearce, Joshua M.] Western Univ, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, London, ON N6A 5B9, Canada; [Peplinski, Jack E.; Pearce, Joshua M.] Western Univ, Ivey Business Sch, London, ON N6A 5B9, Canada",Western University (University of Western Ontario); Western University (University of Western Ontario),"Pearce, JM (corresponding author), Western Univ, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, London, ON N6A 5B9, Canada.; Pearce, JM (corresponding author), Western Univ, Ivey Business Sch, London, ON N6A 5B9, Canada.",cbrook49@uwo.ca; jpeplin2@uwo.ca; joshua.pearce@uwo.ca,"; Pearce, Joshua/C-9240-2013","Brooks, Cameron/0000-0002-1275-3267; Pearce, Joshua/0000-0001-9802-3056; Peplinski, Jack Edward/0000-0003-4169-3643",,,,,70,0,0,1,2,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2411-5134,,INVENTIONS-BASEL,Inventions,APR,2023,8,2,,,,,,,61,10.3390/inventions8020061,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/inventions8020061,,,15,"Engineering, Multidisciplinary",Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI),Engineering,E9CE8,,gold,,,2024-08-15,WOS:000978429200001,,,,287

The authors are focusing on a new symmetrical robot which can be used to rehabilitate the right upper limb and the left upper limb. The robotic arm can be automatically extended or reduced depending on the measurements of the patient's arm. The main idea is to integrate electrical stimulation into motor rehabilitation by robot. The goal is to provide automatic electrical stimulation based on muscle status during the rehabilitation process. Design/methodology/approach The developed robotic arm can be automatically extended or reduced depending on the measurements of the patient's arm. The system merges two rehabilitation strategies: motor rehabilitation and electrical stimulation. The goal is to take the advantages of both approaches. Electrical stimulation is often used for building muscle through endurance, resistance and strength exercises. However, in the proposed approach the electrical stimulation is used for recovery, relaxation and pain relief. In addition, the device includes an electromyography (EMG) muscle sensor that records muscle activity in real time. The control architecture provides the ability to automatically activate the appropriate stimulation mode based on the acquired EMG signal. The system software provides two modes for stimulation activation: the manual preset mode and the EMG driven mode. The program ensures traceability and provides the ability to issue a patient status monitoring report. Findings The developed robotic device is symmetrical and reconfigurable. The presented rehabilitation system includes a muscle stimulator associated with the robot to improve the quality of the rehabilitation process. The integration of neuromuscular electrical stimulation into the physical rehabilitation process offers effective rehabilitation sessions for neuromuscular recovery of the upper limb. A laboratory-made stimulator is developed to generate three modes of stimulation: pain relief, massage and relaxation. Through the control software interface, the physiotherapist can set the exercise movement parameters, define the stimulation mode and record the patient training in real time. Research limitations/implications There are certain constraints when applying the proposed method, such as the sensitivity of the acquired EMG signals. This involves the use of professional equipment and mainly the implementation of sophisticated algorithms for signal extraction. Practical implications Functional electrical stimulation and robot-based motor rehabilitation are the most important technologies applied in post-stroke rehabilitation. The main objective of integrating robots into the rehabilitation process is to compensate for the functions lost in people with physical disabilities. The stimulation technique can be used for recovery, relaxation and drainage and pain relief. In this context, the idea is to integrate electrical stimulation into motor rehabilitation based on a robot to obtain the advantages of the two approaches to further improve the rehabilitation process. The introduction of this type of robot also makes it possible to develop new exciting assistance devices. Originality/value The proposed design is symmetrical, reconfigurable and light, covering all the joints of the upper limbs and their movements. In addition, the developed platform is inexpensive and a portable solution based on open source hardware platforms which opens the way to more extensions and developments. Electrical stimulation is often used to improve motor function and restore loss of function. However, the main objective behind the proposed stimulation in this paper is to recover after effort. The novelty of the proposed solution is to integrate the electrical stimulation powered by EMG in robotic rehabilitation.","[Bouteraa, Yassine; Elmogy, Ahmed] Prince Sattam bin Abdulaziz Univ, Al Kharj, Saudi Arabia; [Bouteraa, Yassine] ENIS, CEM Lab, Sfax, Tunisia; [Bouteraa, Yassine] Univ Sfax, Digital Res Ctr Sfax, Sfax, Tunisia; [Ben Abdallah, Ismail] Natl Sch Engineers Sfax ENIS, Control & Energy Management Lab CEM Lab, Sfax, Tunisia; [Ben Abdallah, Ismail] Digital Res Ctr Sfax, Sfax, Tunisia; [Elmogy, Ahmed] Tanta Univ, Fac Engn, Tanta, Egypt",Prince Sattam Bin Abdulaziz University; Universite de Sfax; Ecole Nationale dIngenieurs de Sfax (ENIS); Universite de Sfax; Centre de Recherche en Numerique de Sfax (CRNS); Universite de Sfax; Ecole Nationale dIngenieurs de Sfax (ENIS); Centre de Recherche en Numerique de Sfax (CRNS); Universite de Sfax; Egyptian Knowledge Bank (EKB); Tanta University,"Bouteraa, Y (corresponding author), Prince Sattam bin Abdulaziz Univ, Al Kharj, Saudi Arabia.; Bouteraa, Y (corresponding author), ENIS, CEM Lab, Sfax, Tunisia.; Bouteraa, Y (corresponding author), Univ Sfax, Digital Res Ctr Sfax, Sfax, Tunisia.",yassinebouteraa@gmail.com; ismaelbanabdallah@yahoo.fr; a.elmogy@psau.edu.sa,"Elmogy, Ahmed/ABB-4988-2021; Bouteraa, Yassine/AAA-7999-2019; Abdallah, Ismail Ben/Q-4762-2016; Tariq, Usman/AAF-8954-2020","Elmogy, Ahmed/0000-0001-7282-6598; Bouteraa, Yassine/0000-0001-8785-3513; Abdallah, Ismail Ben/0000-0003-3836-9009;",Deanship of Scientific Research at Prince Sattam Bin Abdulaziz University [2019/01/11706],Deanship of Scientific Research at Prince Sattam Bin Abdulaziz University,This project was supported by the Deanship of Scientific Research at Prince Sattam Bin Abdulaziz University under the research project # 2019/01/11706.,,40,22,23,7,100,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0143-991X,1758-5791,,IND ROBOT,Ind.

However, the commercially available instruments for studying operant conditioning are expensive, and the design of low-cost chambers has emerged as an appealing alternative to resource-limited laboratories engaged in animal behavior. In this article, we provide a full description of a platform that records the operant behavior and synchronizes it with the electrophysiological activity. The programming of this platform is open source, flexible, and adaptable to a wide range of operant conditioning tasks.

Open-source printers are a potential platform for the insertion of new materials to the printing palette. However, as-purchased, they are not capable of printing high-temperature polymers. To address this, we developed an open-source-based 3D printer with increased environment controls. These include an enclosure and part heating using infrared energy focused on the printed part to keep it close to the desired temperature, while the printer components stay within their design operating ranges. This enables printing of high-temperature polymers while preventing damage to the machine. The effectiveness of this approach is demonstrated by printing polyetherimide parts (T-g = 217 degrees C). The temperature of the part as well as temperatures at various locations in the build chamber is monitored and assessed. We then evaluate the overall success of the approach by showing the relationship between part temperature and final properties such as surface flaws, tensile strength, and interfacial bonding.","[Gardner, John M.; Stelter, Christopher J.; Sauti, Godfrey; Wincheski, Russell A.; Siochi, Emilie J.] NASA, Adv Mat & Proc Branch, Langley Res Ctr, Hampton, VA 23681 USA; [Gardner, John M.; Schniepp, Hannes C.] William & Mary, Dept Appl Sci, Williamsburg, VA 23185 USA; [Kim, Jae-Woo] Natl Inst Aerosp, Hampton, VA 23666 USA; [Yashin, Edward A.] Univ Michigan, Dearborn, MI 48128 USA",National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA); NASA Langley Research Center; National Institute for Aerospace; University of Michigan System; University of Michigan,"Siochi, EJ (corresponding author), NASA, Adv Mat & Proc Branch, Langley Res Ctr, Hampton, VA 23681 USA.",emilie.j.siochi@nasa.gov,"Kim, Jae-Woo/A-8314-2008; Schniepp, Hannes C./B-8368-2008","Schniepp, Hannes C./0000-0003-4645-9469; Gardner, John/0000-0003-3399-5449",NASA Langley Research Center Internal Research and Development program; NASA Langley Research Center Advanced Air Transport Technology project; National Science Foundation [DMR-EF1534428],NASA Langley Research Center Internal Research and Development program; NASA Langley Research Center Advanced Air Transport Technology project; National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)),s This work was supported by NASA Langley Research Center's Internal Research and Development program and the Advanced Air Transport Technology project.

We argue that produsage is not a model that determines a change in the traditional consumption/production paradigm through a series of essential preconditions (such as open participation, peer-sharing, or common ownership). Rather, we explain produsage as the open-ended result of a series of heterogeneous actor-networking strategies. In this view, the so-called preconditions do not explain produsage but have to be explained along with its establishment as an actor-network. Drawing on this approach, we discuss a case study of an open hardware project: the Arduino board, and we develop a perspective that maps the skills of human and non-human entities in produsage actor-networks, showing how skills are symmetrical, relational, and circulating.","[Storni, Cristiano] Univ Limerick, Interact Design Ctr, Dept Comp Sci & Informat Syst, Limerick, Ireland; [De Paoli, Stefano] Natl Univ Ireland Maynooth, Dept Sociol, Maynooth, Kildare, Ireland; [De Paoli, Stefano] Natl Univ Ireland Maynooth, NIRSA, Maynooth, Kildare, Ireland",University of Limerick; Maynooth University; Maynooth University,"Storni, C (corresponding author), Univ Limerick, Interact Design Ctr, Dept Comp Sci & Informat Syst, Limerick, Ireland.",Cristiano.Storni@ul.ie,,,Irish Higher Education Authority,Irish Higher Education Authority,The authors would like to acknowledge the support of the Irish Higher Education Authority under the PRTLI 4 program (FutureComm project).

A versatile and standardized platform is needed to accelerate research and let practitioners focus on the core problems. To this end, we present Agilicious, a codesigned hardware and software framework tailored to autonomous, agile quadrotor flight. It is completely open source and open hardware and supports both model-based and neural network-based controllers. Also, it provides high thrust-to-weight and torque-to-inertia ratios for agility, onboard vision sensors, graphics processing unit (GPU)-accelerated compute hardware for real-time perception and neural network inference, a real-time flight controller, and a versatile software stack. In contrast to existing frameworks, Agilicious offers a unique combination of flexible software stack and high-performance hardware. We compare Agilicious with prior works and demonstrate it on different agile tasks, using both model-based and neural network-based controllers. Our demonstrators include trajectory tracking at up to 5g and 70 kilometers per hour in a motion capture system, and vision-based acrobatic flight and obstacle avoidance in both structured and unstructured environments using solely onboard perception. Last, we demonstrate its use for hardware-in-the-loop simulation in virtual reality environments. Because of its versatility, we believe that Agilicious supports the next generation of scientific and industrial quadrotor research.","[Foehn, Philipp; Kaufmann, Elia; Romero, Angel; Penicka, Robert; Sun, Sihao; Bauersfeld, Leonard; Laengle, Thomas; Cioffi, Giovanni; Song, Yunlong; Loquercio, Antonio; Scaramuzza, Davide] Univ Zurich, Dept Informat, Zurich, Switzerland",University of Zurich,"Foehn, P (corresponding author), Univ Zurich, Dept Informat, Zurich, Switzerland.",foehn@ifi.uzh.ch,"Pěnička, Robert/AAC-4673-2019","Pěnička, Robert/0000-0001-8549-4932; Foehn, Philipp/0000-0001-9585-1278; Scaramuzza, Davide/0000-0002-3831-6778; Bauersfeld, Leonard/0000-0002-5790-9982; Sun, Sihao/0000-0002-8539-3979; Cioffi, Giovanni/0000-0003-3964-8552; Kaufmann, Elia/0000-0001-6094-5901; Song, Yunlong/0000-0002-6352-3744; Romero Aguilar, Angel/0000-0002-7977-7802; Laengle, Thomas/0000-0002-8551-0370",National Centre of Competence in Research (NCCR) Robotics through the Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF); European Union [871479]; European Research Council (ERC) [864042]; European Research Council (ERC) [864042] Funding Source: European Research Council (ERC),National Centre of Competence in Research (NCCR) Robotics through the Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF)(Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF)); European Union(European Union (EU)); European Research Council (ERC)(European Research Council (ERC)); European Research Council (ERC)(European Research Council (ERC)),"This work was supported by the National Centre of Competence in Research (NCCR) Robotics through the Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF) and the European Union's Horizon 2020 Research and Innovation Program under grant agreement no. 871479 (AERIAL-CORE) and the European Research Council (ERC) under grant agreement no. 864042 (AGILEFLIGHT).

This article presents a methodology for the development of an open-architecture controller that is based on reconfigurable hardware under the open source concept for servo applications. The most outstanding contribution of this paper is the implementation of a Genetic Algorithm for online self tuning with a focus on both high-quality servo control and reduction of vibrations during the positioning of a linear motion system. The proposed techniques have been validated on a real platform and form a novel, effective approach as compared to the conventional tuning methods that employ empirical or analytical solutions and cannot improve their parameter set. The controller was elaborated from the Graphical User Interface to the logical implementation while using free tools. This approach also allows for modification and updates to be made easily, thereby reducing the susceptibility to obsolescence. A comparison of the logical implementation with the manufacturer software was also conducted in order to test the performance of free tools in FPGAs. The Graphical User Interface developed in Python presents features, such as speed profiling, controller auto-tuning, measurement of main parameters, and monitoring of servo system vibrations.","[Cruz-Miguel, Edson E.; Garcia-Martinez, Jose R.; Rodriguez-Resendiz, Juvenal; Carrillo-Serrano, Roberto, V] Univ Autonoma Queretaro, Fac Ingn, Div Invest & Posgrad, Queretaro 76010, Mexico",Universidad Autonoma de Queretaro,"Rodríguez-Reséndiz, J (corresponding author), Univ Autonoma Queretaro, Fac Ingn, Div Invest & Posgrad, Queretaro 76010, Mexico.",ecruz30@alumnos.uaq.mx; jose.gm@uaq.mx; juvenal@uaq.edu.mx; roberto.carrillo@uaq.mx,"Rodriguez-Resendiz, Juvenal/AAA-9293-2020; García-Martínez, José Román/HZU-3063-2023","Rodriguez-Resendiz, Juvenal/0000-0001-8598-5600; García-Martínez, José Román/0000-0001-5773-6068","Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia (CONACYT); ""Programa para el Desarrollo Profesional Docente"" (PRODEP)","Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia (CONACYT)(Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia (CONACyT)); ""Programa para el Desarrollo Profesional Docente"" (PRODEP)","This research was funded by the ""Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia (CONACYT)"" and also to ""Programa para el Desarrollo Profesional Docente"" (PRODEP).",,41,18,18,0,12,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,1424-8220,,SENSORS-BASEL,Sensors,NOV,2020,20,21,,,,,,,6155,10.3390/s20216155,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/s20216155,,,21,"Chemistry, Analytical; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Instruments & Instrumentation",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Chemistry; Engineering; Instruments & Instrumentation,OR1GI,33138049.0,"gold, Green Published",,,2024-08-15,WOS:000589224300001,,,,294

When motor actuators were used for robot development in the past, it was difficult to find cost-effective commercial products. Open-source motor controllers, recently developed with the collaboration of many people, have exhibited phenomenal growth as their performance is now comparable to those of commercial products and their price is cheaper. In this study, we utilized an open-source Vedder electronic speed controller (VESC), originally developed for electric skateboards, as a general-purpose motor controller for robot control. The high-speed, high-torque, and high-output VESC was hardware-upgraded to enable more accurate current control, and advanced position and speed control algorithms were developed to produce Myongji-VESC (MJ-VESC), a general-purpose motor controller for multiaxis robot systems. To evaluate its current, speed, and position control performances, MJ-VESC was applied to an open-source planetary geared actuator that can be fabricated with a 3D printer. Based on this, we propose an open-source motor controller framework that can be universally used for multiaxis robot systems.","[Choi, Dongil] Myongji Univ, Dept Mech Engn, Seoul 17058, South Korea",Myongji University,"Choi, DL (corresponding author), Myongji Univ, Dept Mech Engn, Seoul 17058, South Korea.",dongilc@mju.ac.kr,"Choi, Dongil/AAJ-3827-2020","Choi, Dongil/0000-0002-0566-2922",National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) - Korea government (MSIT) [2019R1G1A1008726]; 2018 Research Fund of Myongji University; National Research Foundation of Korea; Myongji University,"National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) - Korea government (MSIT)(National Research Foundation of KoreaMinistry of Science, ICT & Future Planning, Republic of KoreaMinistry of Science & ICT (MSIT), Republic of Korea); 2018 Research Fund of Myongji University; National Research Foundation of Korea(National Research Foundation of Korea); Myongji University","This work was supported in part by the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) grant funded by the Korea government (MSIT) (No. 2019R1G1A1008726), and in part by the 2018 Research Fund of Myongji University. 10.13039/501100003725-National Research Foundation of Korea and 10.13039/501100002538-Myongji University.",,32,4,4,0,11,IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC,PISCATAWAY,"445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA",2169-3536,,,IEEE ACCESS,IEEE Access,,2020,8,,,,,,14134,14145,,10.1109/ACCESS.2020.2965977,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2020.2965977,,,12,"Computer Science, Information Systems; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Telecommunications",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Computer Science; Engineering; Telecommunications,LB6HQ,,gold,,,2024-08-15,WOS:000524735300013,,,,295

The growth rate of leaves at different growth stages determines the overall LAI, which is used by crop growth models (CGM) for simulating yield. Consequently, precise phenotyping of the leaves can help elucidate phenological processes relating to resource capturing. A stable system for acquiring images and a strong data processing backend play a vital role in reducing throughput time and increasing accuracy of calculations, compared to manual analysis. However, most available solutions are not dynamic, as they use color-based segmentation, which fails to capture leaves with varying shades and shapes. We have developed a system that uses a low-cost setup to acquire images and an automated pipeline to manage the data storage on the device and in the cloud. The system is powered by virtual machines that run multiple custom-trained deep learning models to segment out leaves, calculate leaf area (LA) for the whole set and at the individual leaf level, overlays important information on the images, and appends them on a compatible file used for CGMs with very high accuracy. The pipeline is dynamic and can be used for multiple crops. The use of open-source hardware, platforms, and algorithms makes this system affordable and reproducible.","[Potnuru, Chaitanyam; Donepudi, Leela Prasad] Corteva Agrisci, 12Th Floor, V Ascendas IT Pk, Hyderabad, Telangana, India; [Richardson, Grant A.

Researchers are increasingly concerned about exposure to glyphosate and the risks its poses to human health, since it may cause substantial damage, even in small doses. The detection of glyphosate residues in waters is not a simple task, as it requires complex and expensive equipment and qualified personnel. New technological tools need to be designed and developed, based on proven, but also cost-efficient, agile, and user-friendly, analytical techniques, which can be used in the field and in the lab, enabled by connectivity and multiplatform software applications. This article presents the design, development, and testing of an innovative low-cost visible and near-infrared (VIS-NIR) spectrometer (called SpectroGLY), based on Internet of Things (IoT) technologies, which allows potential glyphosate contamination in waters to be detected. SpectroGLY combines the functional concept of a traditional lab spectrometer with the IoT technological concept, enabling the integration of several connectivity options for rural and urban settings and digital visualization and monitoring platforms (Mobile App and Dashboard Web).

IoT devices are currently being used in many fields. IoT devices use Wi-Fi and Bluetooth, however, communication distance is short and battery consumption is high. In areas such as smart cities and smart farms, IoT technology is needed to support a wide coverage with low power consumption. Low Power Wide Area (LPWA), which is a transmission used in IoT supporting a wide area with low power consumption, has evolved. LPWA includes Long Range (LoRa), Narrowband (NB-IoT), and Sigfox. LoRa offers many benefits as it communicates the longest distances, is cheap and consumes less battery. LoRa is used in many countries and covers a range of hundreds of square kilometers (km(2)) with a single gateway. However, if there are many obstacles to smart cities and smart farms, it causes communication problems. This paper proposes two (2) solutions to this problem: the relay method which is a multi-hop method and the Automatic Repeat Request (ARQ) system that detects packet loss in real-time and requests retransmission for LoRa. In this study, the actual performance of LoRa in the problematic environment was measured and the proposed method was applied. It was confirmed that the transmission rate of LoRa dropped when there were many obstacles such as trees. To use LoRa in a smart farm with a lot of space, multi-hop was observed to be better. An ARQ system is needed to compensate for the unexpected drop in the forward rate due to the increase in IoT devices. This research focused on reliability, however, additional network methods and automatic repeat request (ARQ) systems considering battery time should be researched in symmetry. This study covers the interdisciplinary field of computer science and wireless low power communication engineering. We have analyzed the LoRa/LoRaWAN technology in an experimental approach, which has been somewhat less studied than cellular network or WiFi technology. In addition, we presented and improved the performance evaluation results in consideration of various local and climatic environments.","[Choi, Rocksan] Kyung Hee Univ, Dept Comp Sci & Engn, Gyeonggi Do 17104, South Korea; [Lee, SeungGwan] Kyung Hee Univ, Humanitas Coll, Gyeonggi Do 17104, South Korea; [Lee, Sungwon] Kyung Hee Univ, Dept Software Convergence, Gyeonggi Do 17104, South Korea",Kyung Hee University; Kyung Hee University; Kyung Hee University,"Lee, S (corresponding author), Kyung Hee Univ, Dept Software Convergence, Gyeonggi Do 17104, South Korea.",rock3233@khu.ac.kr; leesg@khu.ac.kr; drsungwon@khu.ac.kr,,"Lee, SeungGwan/0000-0002-5510-390X",,,,,19,8,8,1,11,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2073-8994,,SYMMETRY-BASEL,Symmetry-Basel,APR,2020,12,4,,,,,,,552,10.3390/sym12040552,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/sym12040552,,,15,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Science & Technology - Other Topics,LY0NY,,gold,,,2024-08-15,WOS:000540222200063,,,,300

Thus, assuring human health and food production requires efficient strategies and technologies for environmental protection. Knowing key parameters such as soil moisture, air, and water quality is essential for smart farming and urban development. The MeteoMex project aims to build simple hardware kits and their integration into current Internet-of-Things (IoT) platforms. This paper shows the use of low-end Wemos D1 mini boards to connect environmental sensors to the open-source platform ThingsBoard. Two printed circuit boards (PCB) were designed for mounting components. Analog, digital and (IC)-C-2 sensors are supported. The Wemos ESP8266 microchip provides WiFi capability and can be programed with the Arduino IDE. Application examples for the MeteoMex aeria and terra kits demonstrate their functionality for air quality, soil, and climate monitoring. Further, a prototype for monitoring wastewater treatment is shown, which exemplifies the capabilities of the Wemos board for signal processing. The data are stored in a PostgreSQL database, which enables data mining. The MeteoMex IoT system is highly scalable and of low cost, which makes it suitable for deployment in agriculture 4.0, industries, and public areas.

However, UWB researchers are currently limited by the small amount of feasible open source hardware that is publicly available. We developed a new open source hardware platform, Wi-PoS, for precise UWB localization based on Decawave's DW1000 UWB transceiver with several unique features: support of both long-range sub-GHz and 2.4 GHz back-end communication between nodes, flexible interfacing with external UWB antennas, and an easy implementation of the MAC layer with the Time-Annotated Instruction Set Computer (TAISC) framework. Both hardware and software are open source and all parameters of the UWB ranging can be adjusted, calibrated, and analyzed. This paper explains the main specifications of the hardware platform, illustrates design decisions, and evaluates the performance of the board in terms of range, accuracy, and energy consumption. The accuracy of the ranging system was below 10 cm in an indoor lab environment at distances up to 5 m, and accuracy smaller than 5 cm was obtained at 50 and 75 m in an outdoor environment. A theoretical model was derived for predicting the path loss and the influence of the most important ground reflection. At the same time, the average energy consumption of the hardware was very low with only 81 mA for a tag node and 63 mA for the active anchor nodes, permitting the system to run for several days on a mobile battery pack and allowing easy and fast deployment on sites without an accessible power supply or backbone network. The UWB hardware platform demonstrated flexibility, easy installation, and low power consumption.","[Van Herbruggen, Ben; Jooris, Bart; Rossey, Jen; Ridolfi, Matteo; Macoir, Nicola; Van den Brande, Quinten; Lemey, Sam; De Poorter, Eli] Univ Ghent, Dept Informat Technol, IMEC, IDLab, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium",Interuniversity Microelectronics Centre; Ghent University,"Van Herbruggen, B (corresponding author), Univ Ghent, Dept Informat Technol, IMEC, IDLab, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium.",Ben.vanherbruggen@ugent.be; Bart.jooris@ugent.be; Jen.rossey@ugent.be; Matteo.ridolfi@ugent.be; Nicola.macoir@ugent.be; Quinten.vandenbrande@ugent.be; Sam.lemey@ugent.be; Eli.depoorter@ugent.be,"Van Herbruggen, Ben/IQW-9577-2023; Ridolfi, Matteo/AAD-5937-2021; Lemey, Sam/U-1480-2019; De Poorter, Eli/JRX-1676-2023","Van Herbruggen, Ben/0000-0001-8900-4881; Ridolfi, Matteo/0000-0002-6857-2019; De Poorter, Eli/0000-0002-0214-5751; Van den Brande, Quinten/0000-0001-6323-6713; Macoir, Nicola/0000-0003-2066-1570; Lemey, Sam/0000-0003-1366-2604","projects: H2020 interreg Nano4Sport, VLAIO proeftuinproject SmartConnectivity","projects: H2020 interreg Nano4Sport, VLAIO proeftuinproject SmartConnectivity","This work has partially been funded by the following projects: H2020 interreg Nano4Sport, VLAIO proeftuinproject SmartConnectivity.",,28,39,39,1,6,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,1424-8220,,SENSORS-BASEL,Sensors,Apr 1,2019,19,7,,,,,,,1548,10.3390/s19071548,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/s19071548,,,16,"Chemistry, Analytical; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Instruments & Instrumentation",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Chemistry; Engineering; Instruments & Instrumentation,HU8WA,30935046.0,"Green Published, Green Submitted, gold",,,2024-08-15,WOS:000465570700067,,,,302

The target is to adapt open-source 3D printers to be helpful in research lines that use gels, hydrogels, pastes, inks, and bio-inks. Design/methodology/approach This hardware was designed to be compatible with a Graber i3-based 3D printer; nevertheless, it can be easily adapted to other open-source 3D printers. Findings The extrusion head successfully deposits the material during the 3D printing process. It was validated fabricating geometries that include scaffold structures, which are a possible application of bioprinting for tissue engineering. As reported, the extruded filaments allowed the porous samples' structuration. Practical implications This system expands the applications of open-source 3D printers used at the laboratory scale. It enables low-cost access to research areas such as tissue engineering and biofabrication, energy storage devices and food 3D printing. Originality/value The open-source hardware here reported is of simple fabrication, assembly and installation. It uses a Cardan coupling and a three guides system to transfer the stepper motor motion. This approach allows continuous movement transfer to the syringe piston, producing an adequate deposition or retraction. Thus, the effect of misalignments is avoided, considering that these latter can cause skipping steps in the motor, directly affecting the deposition.","[Davila, Jose Luis; Manzini, Bruna Maria; Lopes da Silva, Jorge Vicente] Ctr Tecnol Informacao Renato Archer, LAprint 3D Printing Open Lab, Campinas, Brazil; [D'Avila, Marcos Akira] Univ Estadual Campinas, Sch Mech Engn, Dept Mfg & Mat Engn, Campinas, Brazil",Universidade Estadual de Campinas,"Dávila, JL (corresponding author), Ctr Tecnol Informacao Renato Archer, LAprint 3D Printing Open Lab, Campinas, Brazil.",jose.davila@cti.gov.br,"d´Ávila, Marcos A/B-9083-2012; Dávila, José Luis/AIE-9391-2022","Davila, Jose Luis/0000-0003-0502-5963","FAPESP [2019/02772-7, 2021/07212-0]; iCan micro-enterprise",FAPESP(Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de Sao Paulo (FAPESP)); iCan micro-enterprise,J.

Hundreds of protocols have been reported for cryopreservation of aquatic species, but replicating them is challenging without a reliable monitoring technique during a cryopreservation process.

Specifically, this paper reports an impedance sensing probe compatible with cryogenic temperatures and conventional containers in cryopreservation of aquatic species based on printed circuit board technology its characterization in cryopreservation conditions including different sperm extenders (buffer) compositions and concentrations, presence of cryoprotectant, and multiple cooling rates. The developed probe based on printed circuit board (PCB) technology shows a capability of measuring conditions during cryopreservation differentiating among samples with different buffer contents and cryoprotectants. The probe also demonstrates the capability to distinguish different cooling regimes and detect phase change phenomena. This PCB-based sensing platform provides quantitative impedance measurement data during the cryopreservation process at sample preparation, cooling, and while frozen.

To correct this, we developed an automated system for group-housed mice based on radio frequency identification: the Mouse Position Surveillance System (MoPSS). The system uses an Arduino microcontroller with compatible components; it is affordable and easy to rebuild for every laboratory because it uses free and open-source software and open-source hardware with the RFID readers as the only proprietary component. The MoPSS was validated using female C57BL/6J mice and manual video comparison. It proved to be accurate even for fast-moving mice (up to 100% accuracy after logical reconstruction), and is already implemented in several studies in our laboratory. Here, we provide the complete construction description as well as the validation data and the results of an example experiment. This tracking system will allow group-based preference testing with individually identified mice to be carried out in a convenient manner.

The traditional, design-limiting periodicity in material design is overcome by utilizing Wang tiles to achieve compatibility among building blocks. We illustrate our approach with the design and manufacturing of an L-shaped domain inspired by a scissor-like soft gripper, whose internal module distribution was optimized to achieve an extreme tilt of a tip of the gripper's jaw when the handle part was uniformly compressed. The geometry of individual modules was built on a 3 x 3 grid of elliptical holes with varying semi-axes ratios and alternating orientations. We optimized the distribution of the modules within the L-shaped domain using an enumeration approach combined with a factorial search strategy. To address the challenge of seamless interface connections in modular manufacturing, we produced the final designs by casting silicone rubber into modular molds automatically assembled by a robotic arm. The predicted performance was validated experimentally using a custom-built, open-hardware test rig, Thymos, supplemented with digital image correlation measurements. Our study demonstrates the potential for enhancing the mechanical performance of architectured materials by incorporating nonuniform modular designs and efficient robot-assisted manufacturing.","[Doskar, Martin; Somr, Michael; Hluzek, Radim; Zeman, Jan] Czech Tech Univ, Fac Civil Engn, Dept Mech, Thakurova 7, Prague 6, Czech Republic; [Hluzek, Radim; Havelka, Jan; Novak, Jan] Czech Tech Univ, Fac Civil Engn, Expt Ctr, Thakurova 7, Prague 6, Czech Republic",Czech Technical University Prague; Czech Technical University Prague,"Doskár, M (corresponding author), Czech Tech Univ, Fac Civil Engn, Dept Mech, Thakurova 7, Prague 6, Czech Republic.",martin.doskar@cvut.cz; michael.somr@fsv.cvut.cz; radim.hluzek@fsv.cvut.cz; jan.havelka@fsv.cvut.cz; novakja@fsv.cvut.cz; jan.zeman@cvut.cz,"Zeman, Jan/A-1452-2009; Somr, Michael/F-9922-2019; Novák, Jan/C-7846-2018; Doskar, Martin/C-7097-2018","Zeman, Jan/0000-0003-2503-8120; Somr, Michael/0000-0002-0540-4763; Doskar, Martin/0000-0001-7581-0567",Czech Science Foundation [19-26143X],Czech Science Foundation(Grant Agency of the Czech Republic),"The authors thank the Intelligent and Mobile Robotics (IMR) group at the Czech Institute of Informatics, Robotics and Cybernetics, CTU in Prague for granting us an access to the dual-arm ABB IRB 14000 YuMi collaborative robot.

The resuscitation system is based on the Arduino controller with a real-time operating system installed on a largely RepRap 3-D printable parametric component-based structure. The cost of the materials for the system is under $170, which makes it affordable for replication by makers around the world. The device provides a controlled breathing mode with tidal volumes from 100 to 800 mL, breathing rates from 5 to 40 breaths/minute, and inspiratory-to-expiratory ratio from 1:1 to 1:4. The system is designed for reliability and scalability of measurement circuits through the use of the serial peripheral interface and has the ability to connect additional hardware due to the object-oriented algorithmic approach. Experimental results after testing on an artificial lung for peak inspiratory pressure (PIP), respiratory rate (RR), positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP), tidal volume, proximal pressure, and lung pressure demonstrate repeatability and accuracy exceeding human capabilities in BVM-based manual ventilation. Future work is necessary to further develop and test the system to make it acceptable for deployment outside of emergencies such as with COVID-19 pandemic in clinical environments, however, the nature of the design is such that desired features are relatively easy to add using protocols and parametric design files provided.

However, moderate miniaturization offers many advantages and together with the transfer of modern print and media technologies to the field of chromatography (office chromatography) it opens up new avenues. This is demonstrated in an allin-one open-source system developed for planar chromatography and especially for ultrathin-layer chromatography. Using an InkShield board to control a thermal inkjet cartridge, picoliter drops were printed at a resolution of 96 dpi on the adsorbent layer. Using Marlin, a popular firmware in 3D printing, Cartesian movement of the print head was made possible for full control of the printing process. Open-source software was developed to control the device in each operation step. Sample solutions and mobile phase were inkjet-printed, exemplarily shown for the analysis of dye- or paraben-mixture solutions. Light-emitting diodes (LEDs) were investigated for documentation. For example, deep UV LEDs gave access to 254 nm light, and RGB LEDs gave access to the visible-light range. Calibration functions with correlation coefficients superior to 0.999 were obtained by videodensitometry. The developed modular open-source hardware was compact (26 X 31 X 26 cm(3)), light (<3 kg), and affordable ((sic)810).

The field of automated microscopy has continued to be a challenge in accessibility due the expense and inflexible, noninterchangeable stages. This paper presents a low-cost, open-source microscope 3-D stage. A RepRap 3-D printer was converted to an optical microscope equipped with a customized, 3-D printed holder for a USB microscope. Precision measurements were determined to have an average error of 10 m at the maximum speed and 27 m at the minimum recorded speed. Accuracy tests yielded an error of 0.15%. The machine is a true 3-D stage and thus able to operate with USB microscopes or conventional desktop microscopes. It is larger than all commercial alternatives, and is thus capable of high-depth images over unprecedented areas and complex geometries. The repeatability is below 2-D microscope stages, but testing shows that it is adequate for the majority of scientific applications. The open-source microscope stage costs less than 3-9% of the closest proprietary commercial stages. This extreme affordability vastly improves accessibility for 3-D microscopy throughout the world. Lay description The concept of open-source technology stems from the developmental model of accessibility and ease of use, enabling an environment of continual improvement and open communication. This approach has the potential to dramatically change many fields of study including that of microscope use in research settings. Automated microscopy is often a challenging and inaccessible field due to the cost and non-interchangeable stages, the flat plate on which samples are placed for analysis. This paper presents a low-cost, open source microscope 3-D stage. A RepRap 3-D printer was converted to an optical microscope equipped with a customized, 3-D printed holder for a USB microscope. Precision measurements were determined to have an average error of 10 ?m at the maximum speed and 27 ?m at the minimum recorded speed. Accuracy tests yielded an error of 0.15%. The machine is a true 3-D stage and thus able to operate with USB microscopes or conventional desktop microscopes. Because it is larger than all current commercial alternative systems, it is capable of high depth images over unprecedented areas and complex geometries. The repeatibility is below 2-D microscope stages, but testing shows that it is adequate for the majority of scientific applications. The open source microscope stage costs less than 3% to 9% of the closest proprietary commercial stages. This extreme affordability vastly improves accessibility for 3-D microscopy throughout the world.","[Wijnen, Bas; Petersen, Emily E.; Hunt, Emily J.; Pearce, Joshua M.] Michigan Technol Univ, Dept Mat Sci & Engn, 1400 Townsend Dr, Houghton, MI 49931 USA; [Pearce, Joshua M.] Michigan Technol Univ, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, Houghton, MI 49931 USA",Michigan Technological University; Michigan Technological University,"Pearce, JM (corresponding author), Michigan Technol Univ, Dept Mat Sci & Engn, 1400 Townsend Dr, Houghton, MI 49931 USA.",pearce@mtu.edu,"Hunt, Emily/HGA-3540-2022; Pearce, Joshua/D-2052-2010","Pearce, Joshua/0000-0001-9802-3056",,,,,60,15,18,0,18,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-2720,1365-2818,,J MICROSC-OXFORD,J.

This is a standard protocol of real-time telecontrol applications. The CC is a personal computer, and the RTUs are based on open hardware and software. The RTU hardware is an embedded system, i.e., a system-on-chip-type design using field-programmable gate array that has been programmed with the open-core LEON running Linux operating system. For prototyping, the GR-XC3S-1500 board has been used. As there is no open source code available for the IEC standard protocols, an open source code has also been implemented. Hence, both the hardware and the software are open source in OFESAPO. Several tests have been made to show the system's limitations and the suitability for real-time applications. A prototype has also been tested in a real environment, where the real position of two moving RTUs was shown by a CC using Google Map.","[Medina, Veronica; Rivera, Octavio; Oviedo, David; Dorronzoro, Enrique; Gomez, Isabel] Univ Seville, Dept Elect Technol, ETSI INF, E-41012 Seville, Spain",University of Sevilla,"Medina, V (corresponding author), Univ Seville, Dept Elect Technol, ETSI INF, E-41012 Seville, Spain.",vmedina@us.es; octavio@dte.us.es; oviedo@dte.us.es; enriquedz@dte.us.es; igomez@us.es,"Rivera, Octavio/I-5281-2017; Gomez Gonzalez, Isabel M./L-5957-2014","Dorronzoro Zubiete, Enrique/0000-0001-8478-9851; Gomez Gonzalez, Isabel M./0000-0002-6041-1480; Rivera Romero, Octavio/0000-0001-7212-9805","Regional Government of Andalusia, Spain [P08-TIC-3631]","Regional Government of Andalusia, Spain(Junta de Andalucia)","This work was supported by the Regional Government of Andalusia, Spain, under the framework of the Multimodal Wireless Interface (IMI) Program P08-TIC-3631.

In the past decade various open source syringe pump designs have accelerated scientific research and exploration by reducing costs and introducing new ideas. To further expand the capabilities of open source syringe pumps we introduce a novel syringe pump design, the Ystruder. It features a load cell to monitor the piston force. This capability enables clog detection as well as development of advanced dosing algorithms. The Ystruder can be monitored wirelessly through a browser-based interface that is integrated into the embedded system. The design is modular and simple which facilitates different syringe and motor configurations, to meet a wide range of use cases. Finally, the Ystruder is not limited to functioning solely as a pump as it can be integrated into a wide range of devices such as three-dimensional motion systems. Here the dosing accuracy and repeatability of the Ystruder are quantified, and we demonstrate its functionality both as a syringe pump and a paste extruder for 3D printing. (C) 2019 The Authors.

In this context, affordable precision instruments can play a significant role in the optimization of crops in developing countries where precision agriculture tools are barely available. In this work, a simple to use, cost-effective instrument for spectral analysis of plants and fruits based on open-source hardware and software has been developed. The instrument is a 7-band spectrophotometer equipped with a microprocessor that allows one to acquire the reflectance spectrum of samples and compute up to 9 vegetation indices. The accuracy in reflectance measurements is between 0.4% and 1.4% full scale, just above that of high-end spectrophotometers, while the precision at determining the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) is 0.61%, between 3 and 6 times better than more expensive commercial instruments. Some use cases of this instrument have been tested, and the prototype has proven to be able to precisely monitor minute spectral changes of different plants and fruits under different conditions, most of them before they were perceptible to the bare eye. This kind of information is essential in the decision-making process regarding harvesting, watering, or pest control, allowing precise control of crops. Given the low cost (less than USD 100) and open-source architecture of this instrument, it is an affordable tool to bring precision agriculture techniques to small farmers in developing countries.","[Javier Fernandez-Alonso, Francisco; Torres-Costa, Vicente] Autonomous Univ Madrid, Appl Phys Dept, Madrid 28049, Spain; [Javier Fernandez-Alonso, Francisco; Torres-Costa, Vicente] Autonomous Univ Madrid, Nicolas Cabrera Univ Inst Mat Sci, Madrid 28049, Spain; [Hernandez, Zulimar; Torres-Costa, Vicente] Autonomous Univ Madrid, Copernicus UAM Remote Sensing Lab, Madrid 28049, Spain",Autonomous University of Madrid; Autonomous University of Madrid; Autonomous University of Madrid,"Torres-Costa, V (corresponding author), Autonomous Univ Madrid, Appl Phys Dept, Madrid 28049, Spain.; Torres-Costa, V (corresponding author), Autonomous Univ Madrid, Nicolas Cabrera Univ Inst Mat Sci, Madrid 28049, Spain.; Torres-Costa, V (corresponding author), Autonomous Univ Madrid, Copernicus UAM Remote Sensing Lab, Madrid 28049, Spain.",franciscoj.fernandez05@estudiante.uam.es; zulimar.hernandez@uam.es; vicente.torres@uam.es,"Fernandez Alonso, Francisco Javier/KHC-3807-2024; Torres-Costa, Vicente/L-2379-2013","HERNANDEZ HERNANDEZ, ZULIMAR/0000-0002-7790-8397; Torres-Costa, Vicente/0000-0001-5066-2799; Fernandez Alonso, Francisco Javier/0000-0002-7943-9328","Comunidad de Madrid, Spain within the framework of Universidad Autonoma de Madrid, Spain","Comunidad de Madrid, Spain within the framework of Universidad Autonoma de Madrid, Spain","This work was funded by the Comunidad de Madrid, Spain, within the framework of the agreement with the Universidad Autonoma de Madrid, Spain in item ""Excellence of University Professorate"".",,59,1,1,2,7,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2077-0472,,AGRICULTURE-BASEL,Agriculture-Basel,AUG,2023,13,8,,,,,,,1467,10.3390/agriculture13081467,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/agriculture13081467,,,18,Agronomy,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Agriculture,Q5BY6,,"gold, Green Published",,,2024-08-15,WOS:001057683300001,,,,319

This has lately been applied in the educational domain, aimed to better support learners during the learning process. For this purpose, we have developed the AICARP (Ambient Intelligence Context-aware Affective Recommender Platform) infrastructure, which detects changes in the emotional state of the user and provides personalized multisensorial support to help manage the emotional state by taking advantage of ambient intelligence features. We have developed a third version of this infrastructure, AICARP.V3, which addresses several problems detected in the data acquisition stage of the second version, (i.e., intrusion of the pulse sensor, poor resolution and lowsignal to noise ratio in the galvanic skin response sensor and slow response time of the temperature sensor) and extends the capabilities to integrate new actuators. This improved incorporates a new acquisition platform(shield) called PhyAS (Physiological Acquisition Shield), which reduces the number of control units to only one, and supports both gathering physiological signalswith better precision and delivering multisensory feedback with more flexibility, by means of new actuators that can be added/discarded on top of just that single shield. The improvements in the quality of the acquired signals allow better recognition of the emotional states. Thereof, AICARP.V3 gives a more accurate personalized emotional support to the user, based on a rule-based approach that triggers multisensorial feedback, if necessary. This represents progress in solving an open problem: develop systems that perform as effectively as a human expert in a complex task such as the recognition of emotional states.","[Uria-Rivas, R.; Santos, O.

The main aim of this paper was to present a non-invasive method for assessing simulator sickness by recording gastric myoelectrical activity-electrogastrography. Open-source hardware for electrogastrography together with recordings obtained in 13 healthy volunteers is presented, and the main aspects of signal processing for artifact cancellation and feature extraction were discussed.

However, most vitrification tools adopted in aquatic research were initially designed for applications other than sperm (such as human embryo freezing) and, thus, pose challenges for adoption to sperm vitrification. Three-dimensional (3D) printing combined with open hardware sharing is an emerging strategy to address challenges in the development of cryopreservation tools. The goal of this study was to develop a 3D printed Vitrification Device for Cryo-Vials (VDCV) that can be integrated with the existing vial storage systems. The VDCV combined the vitrification and handling components to achieve functions of sample handling, vitrification, storage, and identification. The vitrification component featured a base, a stem, and a loop. A total of 36 configurations with various loop lengths (8, 10, and 12 mm); loop widths (2.0, 2.5, 3.0, and 3.5 mm); and support structures (open, transverse, and axial) of the VDCD prototypes were designed, fabricated, and tested. Device handling orientations (horizontal and vertical holding angles prior to and during freezing) were also investigated. Computer simulations estimated that the cooling rate of the samples ranged from 0.6-1.5 x 10(5) degrees C/min in all the configurations. Prior to freezing, loops with axial supports produced a minimum of 92% film retention. The overall trends of full vitrification occurrence were observed: horizontal plunging > vertical plunging, and axial support > transverse support and open loop. A loop length of 8 mm had the highest overall vitrification occurrence (86-100%). No significant differences (p = 0.6584) were shown in a volume capacity (5.7-6.0 mu L) among the three supporting configurations. A single unit of VDCV can provide loading efficiencies of about 6 x 10(7) sperm/vial, pooling of samples from 3-6 males/vial, and fertilization for 1800 eggs/vial.

Conventional and proprietary clamps are costly and demand access to supply chains for uncommon mechanical components that limit deployment velocity. To overcome these challenges, this study presents new open-source downward-fastened and side-fastened aluminum (Al) framing designs, which are easy to install and compatible with metal and wood racks. The proposed parametric open-source designs are analyzed through finite element method (FEM) simulations and economic analysis is performed to compare to conventional PV frame at both the module and system levels. The FEM results showed all the frames have acceptable mechanical reliability and stability to pass IEC 61215 standards. The results show the new frame (with a bottom width of 29 mm and thickness of 1.5 mm) has about a 2% land use efficiency penalty, but has better mechanical stability (lower stress and deflections), is easier to install, and has reduced material economic costs compared to conventional frames. The results are promising for the use of the new PV frame designs for distributed manufacturing targeted at specific applications.","[Sadat, Seyyed Ali; Pearce, Joshua M.] Western Univ, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, London, ON N6A 3K7, Canada; [Vandewetering, Nicholas] Western Univ, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, London, ON N6A 3K7, Canada; [Pearce, Joshua M.] Western Univ, Ivey Sch Business, London, ON N6A 3K7, Canada",Western University (University of Western Ontario); Western University (University of Western Ontario); Western University (University of Western Ontario),"Pearce, JM (corresponding author), Western Univ, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, London, ON N6A 3K7, Canada.; Pearce, JM (corresponding author), Western Univ, Ivey Sch Business, London, ON N6A 3K7, Canada.",ssadat6@uwo.ca; nvandew@uwo.ca; joshua.pearce@uwo.ca,,"Sadat, Seyyed Ali/0000-0001-9690-4239",Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada; Thompson Endowment; Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC),Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada(Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)CGIAR); Thompson Endowment; Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)(Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)),This research was funded by the Thompson Endowment and the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC).,,82,0,0,1,1,ASME,NEW YORK,"TWO PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10016-5990 USA",0199-6231,1528-8986,,J SOL ENERG-T ASME,J.

Commercial programmable freezers are costly and thus unaffordable to many users. Self-made devices have substantial variability , resulting in few opportunities for standardization across communities. The development of open hardware with the increasing accessibility of three-dimensional (3-D) printing offers rapid prototyping and easy fabrication of devices by users around the world at low cost. The present study explored the feasibility of developing operational prototypes of 3-D printed motorized cryopreservation devices for continuous freezing of non-batched samples. A controlled cooling conveyor device (CCCD) was designed and fabricated to cryopreserve sperm samples in straws that were loaded onto chain links suspended over liquid nitrogen held in a Styrofoam box. Cooling rates of 5-34 degrees C/min for 0.5-mL French straws were produced by adjusting the height of conveyor chains, slopes, and liquid nitrogen mass. The plunge temperature (-47 degrees C to -61 degrees C) was controlled by adjustment of conveyor speed. The cooling curves from the CCCD were comparable to a commercial programmable freezer. There were no significant differences in post-thaw motility of sperm from ornamental (Koi) common carp (Cyprinus carpio) among samples frozen with the CCCD and those frozen with a commercial programmable freezer. The post-thaw sperm motility was consistent among samples frozen in the CCCD across a 15-min time span. The CCCD prototypes in the present study proved to be feasible and functional as low-cost, customizable, portable, and yet standardizable options for freezing of individual (non-batched) samples. Additional design alternatives are proposed to facilitate further adaptation and development by diverse user communities.","[Liu, Yue; Eskridge, Melissa; Beckham, Jacob; Chesnut, Megan; Monroe, William Todd] Louisiana State Univ, Dept Biol & Agr Engn, 163 EB Doran Bldg, Baton Rouge, LA 70803 USA; [Liu, Yue; Eskridge, Melissa; Beckham, Jacob; Chesnut, Megan; Monroe, William Todd] LSU Agr Ctr, Baton Rouge, LA 70803 USA; [Liu, Yue; Guitreau, Amy; Torres, Leticia; Tiersch, Terrence R.] Louisiana State Univ Agr Ctr, Aquat Germplasm & Genet Resources Ctr, Sch Renewable Nat Resources, Baton Rouge, LA 70820 USA",Louisiana State University System; Louisiana State University; Louisiana State University System; Louisiana State University; Louisiana State University System; Louisiana State University,"Monroe, WT (corresponding author), Louisiana State Univ, Dept Biol & Agr Engn, 163 EB Doran Bldg, Baton Rouge, LA 70803 USA.",tmonroe@lsu.edu,,,,,,,48,9,10,4,9,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0144-8609,1873-5614,,AQUACULT ENG,Aquac.

Threats to ecosystems can go undetected for years or decades as a result. Real-time data can help solve this issue but significant technical barriers exist. For example, automated camera traps are widely used for ecosystem monitoring but it is challenging to transmit images for real-time analysis where there is no reliable cellular or WiFi connectivity. We modified an off-the-shelf camera trap (Bushnell (TM)) and customised existing open-source hardware to create a 'smart' camera trap system. Images captured by the camera trap are instantly labelled by an artificial intelligence model and an 'alert' containing the image label and other metadata is then delivered to the end-user within minutes over the Iridium satellite network. We present results from testing in the Netherlands, Europe, and from a pilot test in a closed-canopy forest in Gabon, Central Africa. All reference materials required to build the system are provided in open-source repositories. Results show the system can operate for a minimum of 3 months without intervention when capturing a median of 17.23 images per day. The median time-difference between image capture and receiving an alert was 7.35 min, though some outliers showed delays of 5-days or more when the system was incorrectly positioned and unable to connect to the Iridium network. We anticipate significant developments in this field and hope that the solutions presented here, and the lessons learned, can be used to inform future advances. New artificial intelligence models and the addition of other sensors such as microphones will expand the system's potential for other, real-time use cases including real-time biodiversity monitoring, wild resource management and detecting illegal human activities in protected areas.","[Whytock, Robin C.; Orbell, Christopher; White, Lee J.

Aplysia encapsulate their zygotes within strands that result in tangled egg masses that greatly complicate culture and experimentation. The historical and current importance of Aplysia for biomedical research and the mounting climate crisis necessitates protection of Aplysia genetic resources. The goal of this work was to prototype open-hardware sizing, processing, and packaging devices for A. californica early life stages suitable for integration into a cryopreservation pathway. The Strand Centi-Sizer was a low-cost, fused filament fabrication 3-D printable device that increased experiment preparation efficiency and standardized the cutting of egg strands customizable to user needs. A downstream system of 3-D printed devices was also prototyped to address inefficiencies in handling of egg strand sections for processing and packaging into existing cryopreservation straw platforms. Time studies were conducted comparing manual methods (i.e., no specialized equipment) with open hardware to demonstrate utility of the devices and to encourage community members to design and prototype new devices to address recurrent and novel problems in other aquatic animals that produce egg strands. Improvements in design could further increase efficiency, standardization, and reproducibility, and extend the application of these devices to other research communities, such as shrimp or salamander spermatophores, sea anemone body part (e.g., pedal lacerate) cryopreservation, or study areas such as vitrification.","[Koch, Jack C.; Oune, Allyssa M.; Bodenstein, Sarah; Tiersch, Terrence R.] Louisiana State Univ, Agr Ctr, Sch Renewable Nat Resources, Aquat Germplasm & Genet Resources Ctr AGGRC, Baton Rouge, LA 70820 USA; [Bodenstein, Sarah] Louisiana State Univ, Louisiana Sea Grant, Baton Rouge, LA 70820 USA",Louisiana State University System; Louisiana State University; Louisiana State University System; Louisiana State University,"Koch, JC (corresponding author), Louisiana State Univ, Agr Ctr, Sch Renewable Nat Resources, Aquat Germplasm & Genet Resources Ctr AGGRC, Baton Rouge, LA 70820 USA.",jack.c.koch@gmail.com,,"Bodenstein, Sarah/0000-0001-9057-2771","National Institutes of Health, Office of Research Infrastructure Programs [R24-OD010441, R24-OD028443]; National Institute of Food and Agriculture, United States Department of Agriculture Hatch project [P40-OD010952-28];  [LAB94420]","National Institutes of Health, Office of Research Infrastructure Programs; National Institute of Food and Agriculture, United States Department of Agriculture Hatch project;","We thank the staff at the National Resource for Aplysia for their continued support of this project and for providing advice and discussion.

Methods: This article describes three different setups from 50 to 360 mT in different settings, all of which used the MaRCoS console for acquiring data, and different types of software interface (custom-built GUI or Pulseq overlay) to acquire it. Results: Images are presented both from phantoms and in vivo from healthy volunteers to demonstrate the image quality that can be obtained from the MaRCoS hardware/software interfaced to different low-field magnets. Conclusions: The results presented here show that a number of different sequences commonly used in the clinic can be programmed into an open-source system relatively quickly and easily, and can produce good quality images even at this early stage of development. Both the hardware and software will continue to develop, and it is an aim of this article to encourage other groups to join this international consortium.","[Guallart-Naval, Teresa; Algarin, Jose M.; Galve, Fernando; Alonso, Joseba] CSIC, MRILab, Inst Mol Imaging & Instrumentat i3M, Valencia, Spain; [Guallart-Naval, Teresa; Algarin, Jose M.; Galve, Fernando; Alonso, Joseba] Univ Politecn Valencia UPV, Valencia, Spain; [Guallart-Naval, Teresa] Tesoro Imaging SL, Valencia, Spain; [O'Reilly, Thomas; Webb, Andrew] Leiden Univ Med Ctr, Dept Radiol, Leiden, Netherlands; [Pellicer-Guridi, Ruben] Assoc Invest MPC, Donostia San Sebastian, Spain; [Vives-Gilabert, Yolanda] Univ Valencia, Dept Elect Engn, Intelligent Data Anal Lab, Valencia, Spain; [Craven-Brightman, Lincoln; Stockmann, Jason P.] Massachusetts Gen Hosp, AA Martinos Ctr Biomed Imaging, Charlestown, MA USA; [Negnevitsky, Vlad] Oxford Ion Ltd, Oxford, England; [Menkuc, Benjamin] Univ Appl Sci & Arts Dortmund, Dortmund, Germany",Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas (CSIC); Universitat Politecnica de Valencia; CSIC-UPV-CIEMAT - Instituto de Instrumentacion para Imagen Molecular (I3M); Universitat Politecnica de Valencia; Leiden University; Leiden University Medical Center (LUMC); University of Valencia; Harvard University; Massachusetts General Hospital,"Alonso, J (corresponding author), CSIC, MRILab, Inst Mol Imaging & Instrumentat i3M, Valencia, Spain.; Alonso, J (corresponding author), Univ Politecn Valencia UPV, Valencia, Spain.",joseba.alonso@i3m.upv.es,"Pellicer-Guridi, Ruben/HOH-2828-2023; Webb, Andrew/G-9642-2016; Galve, Fernando/M-3401-2014","Pellicer-Guridi, Ruben/0000-0001-9263-4921; Vives-Gilabert, Yolanda/0000-0002-3744-5893; Galve, Fernando/0000-0002-1600-7341; Menkuc, Benjamin/0000-0002-7586-620X",European Regional Development Fund; Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovacion,European Regional Development Fund(European Union (EU)); Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovacion(Instituto de Salud Carlos IIISpanish Government),European Regional Development Fund; Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovacion,,55,7,7,0,9,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0952-3480,1099-1492,,NMR BIOMED,NMR Biomed.,JAN,2023,36,1,,,,,,,,10.1002/nbm.4825,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/nbm.4825,,Sep 2022,13,"Biophysics; Radiology, Nuclear Medicine & Medical Imaging; Spectroscopy",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),"Biophysics; Radiology, Nuclear Medicine & Medical Imaging; Spectroscopy",6W1WG,36097704.0,"Green Submitted, Green Published, hybrid",,,2024-08-15,WOS:000861411200001,,,,332

Guidelines for the management of the elder with falls are comprised of multidimensional assessments, especially gait and balance. Daily clinical practice needs for timely, effortless, and precise tools to assess gait. This work presents the clinical validation of the G-STRIDE system, a 6-axis inertial measurement unit (IMU) with onboard processing algorithms, that allows the calculation of walking-related metrics correlated with clinical markers of fall risk. A cross-sectional case-control study was conducted with 163 participants (falls and non-falls groups). All volunteers were assessed with clinical scales and conducted a 15-min walking test at a self-selected pace while wearing the G-STRIDE. G-STRIDE is a low-cost solution to facilitate the transfer to society and clinical evaluations. It is open hardware and flexible and, thus, has the advantage of providing runtime data processing. Walking descriptors were derived from the device, and a correlation analysis was conducted between walking and clinical variables. G-STRIDE allowed measuring walking parameters in non-restricted walking conditions (e.g. hallway). Walking parameters statistically discriminate between falls and non-falls groups. We found good/excellent estimation accuracy (ICC = 0.885; p < 0.000 ) for walking speed, showing good/excellent correlation between gait speed and several clinical variables. G-STRIDE can calculate walking-related metrics that allow for discrimination between falls and non-falls groups, which correlates with clinical indicators of fall risk. A preliminary fall-risk assessment based on the walking parameters was found to improve the Timed Up and Go test in the identification of fallers.","[Alvarez, Marta Neira] Infanta Sofia Hosp HUIS, Fdn Res & Biomed Innovat, Dept Geriatr, Madrid 28702, Spain; [Ruiz, Antonio R.

This paper introduces RAVA, a true random number generator based on avalanche noise. RAVA is an open-source device designed to offer a transparent and customizable platform, making auditable and high-quality entropy accessible to a wider audience. The device employs a differential design, which involves comparing two similar noise sources to mitigate the impact of environmental factors. Furthermore, RAVA incorporates a dual entropy core architecture featuring two independent entropy channels that generate random bytes simultaneously. A stochastic model is theoretically derived and empirically confirmed, offering valuable insights into the entropy extraction mechanism and allowing the estimation of the minimum bias attainable. An implementation is presented as a discrete circuit with an ATmega32U4 microcontroller including a USB interface, achieving an unbiased throughput of 136.0 Kbit/s without the necessity of post-processing algorithms. The generated random bytes are evaluated for bias and serial correlation, their entropy is assessed using NIST SP 800-90B estimators, and the randomness quality is verified using the NIST 800-22R1a test suit. For comparison, the same tests are applied to a commercial device based on quantum optical phenomena, revealing similar distributions for both devices across the studied metrics.","[Guerrer, Gabriel] Dor Inst Res & Educ IDOR, IDOR Pioneer Sci Fellow, BR-22281100 Rio de Janeiro, Brazil; [Guerrer, Gabriel] Paradox Sci Inst, Palo Alto, CA 94306 USA",IDOR - Instituto D'Or de Ensino e Pesquisa,"Guerrer, G (corresponding author), Dor Inst Res & Educ IDOR, IDOR Pioneer Sci Fellow, BR-22281100 Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.; Guerrer, G (corresponding author), Paradox Sci Inst, Palo Alto, CA 94306 USA.",gabriel.guerrer@idor.org,,,D'Or Institute for Research and Education (IDOR),D'Or Institute for Research and Education (IDOR),This work was supported by the D'Or Institute for Research and Education (IDOR).,,24,1,1,0,0,IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC,PISCATAWAY,"445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA",2169-3536,,,IEEE ACCESS,IEEE Access,,2023,11,,,,,,119568,119583,,10.1109/ACCESS.2023.3327325,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2023.3327325,,,16,"Computer Science, Information Systems; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Telecommunications",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Computer Science; Engineering; Telecommunications,X8KG2,,gold,,,2024-08-15,WOS:001100865400001,,,,338

Many assessment methods use assumptions instead of measured data because it is cumbersome, time-intensive, and cost-intensive to acquire up-to-date, on-site measured data. This work bridges this gap by presenting the design of an open-source, wireless sensor network (WSN) that is easy to program, manufacture, modify, and deploy. The version of the WSN presented here measures air temperature, relative humidity, supply and return temperature of hot water from the heating system and the radiators, heat flux through the walls and the windows, luminosity, oil flow, electricity, window opening times, and CO2-concentration. The modularity of the WSN allows it to be extended with the addition of new types of sensors to the existing hardware framework. The data is streamed to an online database, allowing monitoring of the measurements in near real-time. The cost and performance of the sensor network are intended to be as good as or better than the existing solutions. The current cost for one temperature sensor node starts at 116 USD. The observed battery lifetime reaches up to a year for a five-minute sampling interval. The average installation time for a sensor node is 7 min. We describe the hardware architecture, software architecture, cost of the WSN, along with results from co-location tests, and a deployment in an occupied building.","[Frei, Mario; Deb, Chirag; Stadler, Ruben; Schlueter, Arno] ETH, Chair Architecture & Bldg Syst, Stefano Franscini Pl 1, CH-8093 Zurich, Switzerland; [Nagy, Zoltan] Univ Texas Austin, Intelligent Environm Lab, 301 E Dean Keeton St St C1700, Austin, TX 78712 USA",Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich; University of Texas System; University of Texas Austin,"Frei, M (corresponding author), ETH, Chair Architecture & Bldg Syst, Stefano Franscini Pl 1, CH-8093 Zurich, Switzerland.",mario.frei@arch.ethz.ch,"Nagy, Zoltan/E-1435-2016; Schlueter, Arno/CAF-1531-2022; Deb, Chirag/AAA-9486-2021; Frei, Mario/T-2871-2018","Nagy, Zoltan/0000-0002-6014-3228; Schlueter, Arno/0000-0003-4999-2218; Frei, Mario/0000-0003-2193-5211",Office for Water and Energy of the Canton St. Gallen (AWE); Swiss Innovation Agency Innosuisse,Office for Water and Energy of the Canton St. Gallen (AWE); Swiss Innovation Agency Innosuisse,We thank our colleagues Martin Gahwiler and Lukas Gautschi from the electronics workshop of the physics department of our institution.

Closed-loop experiments, in which causal interventions are conditioned on the state of the system under investigation, have become increasingly common in neuroscience. Such experiments can have a high degree of explanatory power, but they require a precise implementation that can be difficult to replicate across laboratories. We sought to overcome this limitation by building open-source software that makes it easier to develop and share algorithms for closed-loop control. Approach. We created the Open Ephys GUI, an opensource platform for multichannel electrophysiology experiments. In addition to the standard 'open-loop' visualization and recording functionality, the GUI also includes modules for delivering feedback in response to events detected in the incoming data stream. Importantly, these modules can be built and shared as plugins, which makes it possible for users to extend the functionality of the GUI through a simple API, without having to understand the inner workings of the entire application. Main results. In combination with low-cost, open-source hardware for amplifying and digitizing neural signals, the GUI has been used for closedloop experiments that perturb the hippocampal theta rhythm in a phase-specific manner. Significance. The Open Ephys GUI is the first widely used application for multichannel electrophysiology that leverages a plugin-based workflow. We hope that it will lower the barrier to entry for electrophysiologists who wish to incorporate real-time feedback into their research.","[Siegle, Joshua H.] Allen Inst Brain Sci, 615 Westlake Ave N, Seattle, WA 98109 USA; [Lopez, Aaron Cuevas] Univ Politecn Valencia, Cami Vera S-N, E-46022 Valencia, Spain; [Patel, Yogi A.] Georgia Inst Technol, North Ave NW, Atlanta, GA 30332 USA; [Abramov, Kirill] Zaporizhzhya State Engn Acad, Sobornyi Ave 226, UA-69006 Zaporizhia, Zaporizka Oblas, Ukraine; [Ohayon, Shay; Voigts, Jakob] MIT, 77 Massachusetts Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Lopez, Aaron Cuevas] Inst Neurociencias CSIC UMH, Ave Santiago Ramon y Cajal S-N, Alicante 03550, Spain",Allen Institute for Brain Science; Universitat Politecnica de Valencia; University System of Georgia; Georgia Institute of Technology; Ministry of Education & Science of Ukraine; Zaporizhzhia National University; Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT); Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas (CSIC); Universidad Miguel Hernandez de Elche; CSIC-UMH - Instituto de Neurociencias de Alicante (IN),"Siegle, JH (corresponding author), Allen Inst Brain Sci, 615 Westlake Ave N, Seattle, WA 98109 USA.",joshs@alleninstitute.org,,"Cuevas Lopez, Aaron/0000-0002-1228-5045",,,,,31,249,293,2,17,IOP PUBLISHING LTD,BRISTOL,"TEMPLE CIRCUS, TEMPLE WAY, BRISTOL BS1 6BE, ENGLAND",1741-2560,1741-2552,,J NEURAL ENG,J.

Despite the recent advent of open-source hardware, the available open-source caches have low configurability, limited lack of support for single-cycle pipelined memory accesses, and use non-standard hardware interfaces. In this paper, the IObundle cache (IOb-Cache), a high-performance configurable open-source cache is proposed, developed and deployed. The cache has front-end and back-end modules for fast integration with processors and memory controllers. The front-end module supports the native interface, and the back-end module supports the native interface and the standard Advanced eXtensible Interface (AXI). The cache is highly configurable in structure and access policies. The back-end can be configured to read bursts of multiple words per transfer to take advantage of the available memory bandwidth. To the best of our knowledge, IOb-Cache is currently the only configurable cache that supports pipelined Central Processing Unit (CPU) interfaces and AXI memory bus interface. Additionally, it has a write-through buffer and an independent controller for fast, most of the time 1-cycle writing together with 1-cycle reading, while previous works only support 1-cycle reading. This allows the best clocks-per-Instruction (CPI) to be close to one (1.055). IOb-Cache is integrated into IOb System-on-Chip (IOb-SoC) Github repository, which has 29 stars and is already being used in 50 projects (forks).","[Roque, Joao, V] IObundle Lda, P-1000158 Lisbon, Portugal; [Lopes, Joao D.; Vestias, Mario P.; de Sousa, Jose T.] INESC ID, P-1000029 Lisbon, Portugal; [Vestias, Mario P.] Inst Super Engn Lisboa, P-1959007 Lisbon, Portugal; [Vestias, Mario P.] Inst Politecn Lisboa, P-1549003 Lisbon, Portugal; [de Sousa, Jose T.] Univ Lisbon, Inst Super Tecn, P-1649004 Lisbon, Portugal",INESC-ID; Universidade de Lisboa; Polytechnic Institute of Lisbon; Polytechnic Institute of Lisbon; Universidade de Lisboa,"de Sousa, JT (corresponding author), INESC ID, P-1000029 Lisbon, Portugal.; de Sousa, JT (corresponding author), Univ Lisbon, Inst Super Tecn, P-1649004 Lisbon, Portugal.",joao.v.roque@tecnico.ulisboa.pt; joao.d.lopes@tecnico.ulisboa.pt; mario.vestias@isel.pt; jose.desousa@inesc-id.pt,"de Sousa, Jose/L-6859-2015; Véstias, Mário/H-9953-2012","de Sousa, Jose/0000-0001-7525-7546; Véstias, Mário/0000-0001-8556-4507; D.

To ensure that a private network satisfies its own requirements and guarantees coverage, it is important to accurately measure the radio performance at the accurate position to further optimize the network. Additionally, as carrier frequencies increase, cellular network-based positioning becomes increasingly important, as it enables more accurate positioning. For example, centimeter-level accuracy is expected in beyond 5G systems owing to the sub-THz band carrier frequency. To accurately compare and assess various cellular network-based positioning methods, positioning devices, which can move along the same trajectory more accurately than at the centimeter-level, are required. To this end, we implemented a three-dimensional (3D) positioning device developed from open-source hardware, which is generally used to implement computer numerical control (CNC) machines and 3D printers. The implemented 3D pointing device is cost-effective and portable and can be freely configurable and resized in one, two, and three dimensions owing to the use of open-source hardware. The received signal strength indicator (RSSI) employing the LoRa module can be obtained using the implemented device. Using a very low carrier frequency system, it is possible to accurately measure the RSSI variations due to multipath propagation. After demonstrating the reproducibility of the data, the effectiveness of the implemented device was confirmed by showing that the RSSI variation and fading correlation coefficient are close to the Rayleigh fading variation.","[Makino, Issei; Miki, Nobuhiko] Kagawa Univ, Fac Engn & Design, Takamatsu, Kagawa 7610396, Japan",Kagawa University,"Miki, N (corresponding author), Kagawa Univ, Fac Engn & Design, Takamatsu, Kagawa 7610396, Japan.",miki.nobuhiko@kagawa-u.ac.jp,,,,,,,37,0,0,0,4,IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC,PISCATAWAY,"445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA",2169-3536,,,IEEE ACCESS,IEEE Access,,2023,11,,,,,,11254,11267,,10.1109/ACCESS.2023.3240192,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2023.3240192,,,14,"Computer Science, Information Systems; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Telecommunications",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Computer Science; Engineering; Telecommunications,9B7XO,,gold,,,2024-08-15,WOS:000934946900001,,,,344

The most concerning threats are hardware trojans. A hardware trojan is a malicious inclusion or alteration to the existing design of an integrated circuit, with the possible effects ranging from leakage of sensitive information to the complete destruction of the integrated circuit itself. While the majority of existing detection schemes focus on test-time, they all require expensive methodologies to detect hardware trojans. Off-the-shelf approaches have often been overlooked due to limited hardware resources and detection accuracy. With the advances in technologies and the democratisation of open-source hardware, however, these tools enable the detection of hardware trojans at reduced costs during or after production. In this manuscript, a hardware trojan is created and emulated on a consumer FPGA board. The experiments to detect the trojan in a dormant and active state are made using off-the-shelf technologies taking advantage of different techniques such as Power Analysis Reports, Side Channel Analysis and Thermal Measurements. Furthermore, multiple attempts to detect the trojan are demonstrated and benchmarked. Our simulations result in a state-of-the-art methodology to accurately detect the trojan in both dormant and active states using off-the-shelf hardware.","[Rooney, Catherine; Bellekens, Xavier] Abertay Univ, Div Cyber Secur, Dundee DD1 1HG, Scotland; [Seeam, Amar] Middlesex Univ, Dept Comp Sci, Mauritius Campus, Flic En Flac, Mauritius",University of Abertay Dundee; Middlesex University,"Bellekens, X (corresponding author), Abertay Univ, Div Cyber Secur, Dundee DD1 1HG, Scotland.",c.rooney@abertay.ac.uk; a.seeam@mdx.ac.mu; x.bellekens@abertay.ac.uk,"bellekens, xavier/AAA-2612-2020","bellekens, xavier/0000-0003-1849-5788; SEEAM, AMAR/0000-0001-8203-1545",,,,,28,15,15,0,11,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",2079-9292,,,ELECTRONICS-SWITZ,Electronics,JUL,2018,7,7,,,,,,,124,10.3390/electronics7070124,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/electronics7070124,,,21,"Computer Science, Information Systems; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Physics, Applied",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Computer Science; Engineering; Physics,GO7BU,,"Green Accepted, gold",,,2024-08-15,WOS:000440211600025,,,,345

The question of using renewable energy sources is also essential for the sustainability of wireless sensor networks and the Industrial Internet of Things, especially in scenarios where there is a need to deploy an extensive number of sensor nodes and smart devices in industrial environments. Because of that, this paper targets the problem of monitoring the operations of solar-powered wireless sensor nodes applicable for a variety of Industrial IoT environments, considering their required locations in outdoor scenarios and the efficient solar power harvesting effects. This paper proposes a distributed wireless sensor network system architecture based on open-source hardware and open-source software technologies to achieve that. The proposed architecture is designed for acquiring solar radiation data and other ambient parameters (solar panel and ambient temperature, light intensity, etc.). These data are collected primarily to define estimation techniques using nonlinear regression for predicting solar panel voltage outputs that can be used to achieve energy-efficient operations of solar-powered sensor nodes in outdoor Industrial IoT systems. Additionally, data can be used to analyze and monitor the influence of multiple ambient data on the efficiency of solar panels and, thus, powering sensor nodes. The architecture proposal considers the variety of required data and the transmission and storage of harvested data for further processing. The proposed architecture is implemented in the small-scale variants for evaluation and testing. The platform is further evaluated with the prototype sensor node for collecting solar panel voltage generation data with open-source hardware and low-cost components for designing such data acquisition nodes. The sensor node is evaluated in different scenarios with solar and artificial light conditions for the feasibility of the proposed architecture and justification of its usage. As a result of this research, the platform and the method for implementing estimation techniques for sensor nodes in various sensor and IoT networks, which helps to achieve edge intelligence, is established.","[Dobrilovic, Dalibor; Pekez, Jasmina; Desnica, Eleonora; Radovanovic, Ljiljana; Mazalica, Milica; Djordjevic, Luka; Mihajlovic, Sinisa] Univ Novi Sad, Tech Fac Mihajlo Pupin Zrenjanin, Zrenjanin 23000, Serbia; [Palinkas, Ivan] Tech Coll Appl Sci, Zrenjanin 23000, Serbia",University of Novi Sad,"Pekez, J (corresponding author), Univ Novi Sad, Tech Fac Mihajlo Pupin Zrenjanin, Zrenjanin 23000, Serbia.",dalibor.dobrilovic@tfzr.rs; jasmina.pekez@tfzr.rs; eleonora.desnica@tfzr.rs; ljiljana.radovanovic@tfzr.rs; ivanpalinkas@gmail.com,"Dobrilovic, Dalibor/D-9743-2012; Desnica, Eleonora Z/E-3685-2016; Djordjevic, Luka/JPA-3187-2023","Djordjevic, Luka/0000-0003-4578-9060; Mazalica, Milica/0009-0005-7944-1259; Radovanovic, Ljiljana/0000-0002-5234-4820; Mihajlovic, Sinisa/0000-0003-4456-007X; Pekez, Jasmina/0000-0003-0454-5326","Provincial Secretariat for Higher Education and Scientific Research, Republic of Serbia, Autonomous Province of Vojvodina [142-451-3118/2022-01]","Provincial Secretariat for Higher Education and Scientific Research, Republic of Serbia, Autonomous Province of Vojvodina","The research is conducted through the project ""Creating laboratory conditions for research, development, and education in the field of the use of solar resources in the Internet of Things"" at the Technical Faculty ""Mihajlo Pupin"" Zrenjanin, financed by the Provincial Secretariat for Higher Education and Scientific Research, Republic of Serbia, Autonomous Province of Vojvodina, Project number 142-451-3118/2022-01.",,46,3,3,2,3,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2071-1050,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,Apr 30,2023,15,9,,,,,,,7440,10.3390/su15097440,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su15097440,,,22,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,G1UT2,,gold,,,2024-08-15,WOS:000987098300001,,,,346

Static positioning accuracy and precision are calculated within the Region of Interest (ROI) and an average position error of 1.0 +/- 0.1 mm is demonstrated. Results show an indicative increase in the update rate using the C++ framework and substantially lower memory requirements, compared to the previously optimised Python and Matlab solvers. These preliminary results provide the basis for future development which will integrate the C++ framework in a 3D Slicer module, greatly extending the adaptability of the platform for customisation in advanced image-guided procedures.","[Cavaliere, Marco; Walsh, Conor; Jaeger, Herman Alexander; Cantillon-Murphy, Padraig] Univ Coll Cork, Dept Elect & Elect Engn, Cork, Ireland; [Cavaliere, Marco; Jaeger, Herman Alexander; O'Donoghue, Kilian; Cantillon-Murphy, Padraig] Tyndall Natl Inst, Microelect Circuits Ctr Ireland MCCI, Cork, Ireland",University College Cork; University College Cork,"Cavaliere, M (corresponding author), Univ Coll Cork, Cork, Ireland.",m.cavaliere.ucc@gmail.com,"Walsh, Chloe/AAM-1093-2020","Cavaliere, Marco/0000-0003-1901-0041; Jaeger, Herman Alexander/0000-0003-4771-8469","Science Foundation Ireland [17/CDA/4771, TIDA17/4897]; European Union [101002225]; Science Foundation Ireland (SFI) [17/CDA/4771] Funding Source: Science Foundation Ireland (SFI); European Research Council (ERC) [101002225] Funding Source: European Research Council (ERC)",Science Foundation Ireland(Science Foundation Ireland); European Union(European Union (EU)); Science Foundation Ireland (SFI)(Science Foundation Ireland); European Research Council (ERC)(European Research Council (ERC)),"This work was supported by the Science Foundation Ireland [17/CDA/4771, TIDA17/4897].

Those parameters are assessed objectively with commercial instrumentation such as computer-assisted sperm analysis systems (CASA) and hemocytometer. In CASA systems, sperm motility is assessed in the horizontal plane imposed by the stage of the microscope. Thus, there is lack of measurement of the vertical velocity of sperm. The female reproductive tract is a tridimensional space which the sperm traverse to reach the ovum, and there is a need for instruments measuring parameters more relevant to this real-world situation. In this report we describe the design, construction and use of an open-source hardware (OSH) device for evaluation of the vertical velocity of sperm, called UPSPERM. This device was also used to measure sperm concentration, and agreement with hemocytometer was evaluated. Bland-Altman analysis shows good agreement between these two methods of sperm counting. As a first application of UPSPERM, we evaluated the changes in boar sperm motility at distinct pH values between 7.0 and 8.0. The UPSPERM results showed that the vertical velocity of sperm was highest at pH 7.6 and 7.8. We propose that our UPSPERM offers a reliable and affordable option for obtaining measurements of vertical velocity and sperm concentration.","[Rivas Arzaluz, Cindy; Aragon Martinez, Andres] UNAM, Fac Estudios Super Iztacala, Lab Gametos & Desarrollo Tecnol, Paseo Barrios 1, Tlalnepantla, Estado De Mexic, Mexico; [Rivas Arzaluz, Cindy] Unidad Posgrad, Posgrad Ciencias Biol, Edificio A,1er Piso,Ciudad Univ, Mexico City, DF, Mexico; [Ayala, Maria E.] Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Fac Estudios Super Zaragoza, Lab Pubertad, Unidad Invest Biol Reprod, Mexico City, DF, Mexico",Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico; Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico; Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico,"Martínez, AA (corresponding author), Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Fac Estudios Super Iztacala, Ave Barrios 1, Tlalnepantla 54090, Estado De Mexic, Mexico.",armandres@gmail.com,"Aragón, Andrés/AAH-6750-2020; Rivas, Cindy/AEK-8990-2022","Aragón, Andrés/0000-0003-2352-2197;",PAPPIT [IN221018],PAPPIT,"PAPPIT, Grant/Award Number: IN221018",,39,3,3,1,3,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1552-4922,1552-4930,,CYTOM PART A,Cytom.

The objective of this paper is to propose a methodology to improve the operation of these systems, associated with small and medium-sized livestock farms, in insular and isolated systems such as the Canary Islands. An Integrated and Resilient System (IRS) for monitoring and measuring operational variables quasi-continuous and in situ is proposed. Low-cost technology and open source hardware are employed, as well as application of the IoT (Internet of Things) strategies to share and analyze the information collected in the cloud. In view of the high degree of resilience and the simplicity of this type of technology, as well as its low cost, it is concluded that it is feasible to create a measurement system with these characteristics that can be used for NTSW parameterization, and other purposes. Satisfactory results were obtained for several parameters (ambient temperature, relative humidity, UV radiation, atmospheric pressure). It is presented as a novel proposal based mainly on low-cost technology and free software with which to improve the NTSW operation process.","[Rodriguez-Perez, Melania L.; Mendieta-Pino, Carlos A.; Brito-Espino, Saulo; Ramos-Martin, Alejandro] Univ Las Palmas de Gran Canaria ULPGC, Inst Environm Studies & Nat Resources i UNAT, Las Palmas Gran Canaria 35214, Spain; [Mendieta-Pino, Carlos A.; Ramos-Martin, Alejandro] Univ Las Palmas de Gran Canaria ULPGC, Dept Proc Engn, Las Palmas Gran Canaria 35214, Spain",Universidad de Las Palmas de Gran Canaria; Universidad de Las Palmas de Gran Canaria,"Rodríguez-Pérez, ML (corresponding author), Univ Las Palmas de Gran Canaria ULPGC, Inst Environm Studies & Nat Resources i UNAT, Las Palmas Gran Canaria 35214, Spain.",melania.rodriguez103@alu.ulpgc.es,"Pino, Carlos/ISS-0593-2023; Ramos, Alejandro/H-4351-2015","Ramos, Alejandro/0000-0001-5759-4469; Mendieta Pino, Carlos Alberto/0000-0002-1808-0112",INTERREG V-A Cooperation Spain-Portugal MAC (Madeira-Azores-Canarias) MITIMAC program [MAC2/1.1a/263],INTERREG V-A Cooperation Spain-Portugal MAC (Madeira-Azores-Canarias) MITIMAC program,research has been co-funded by the INTERREG V-A Cooperation Spain-Portugal MAC (Madeira-Azores-Canarias) MITIMAC program through project MAC2/1.1a/263.,,115,3,3,0,1,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2073-4441,,WATER-SUI,Water,SEP,2022,14,18,,,,,,,2917,10.3390/w14182917,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w14182917,,,20,Environmental Sciences; Water Resources,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Water Resources,4R8YD,,"gold, Green Published",,,2024-08-15,WOS:000857041300001,,,,349

This study provides designs of an open source bottle roller that is compatible with distributed digital manufacturing using 3-D printed parts and readily-available commercial components.

The design, how-ever, is more robust with enhanced capabilities. The design can be adapted to the user's needs, but is already compatible with incubators with a low profile (dimensions 50 cm x46 cm x8.8 cm) and capable of being operated at elevated temperatures. The systems can be adjusted to revolves from 1 to 200 RPM, exceeding the rotational speed of most commercial systems. The open source bottle roller as tested has a capacity greater than 1.2 kg and can roll twelve 100 mL bottles simultaneously. Validation testing showed that it can operate for days at 80 RPM without human intervention or monitoring for days at both room temperature and elevated temperatures (50 & DEG;C).

We present the design and characterization of an electrostatic precipitator that is intended to be incorporated into aerosol sampling equipment. Hardware and software components of the design are open, all components can be directly purchased from vendors, and the device can be assembled with standard tools. Generic components are used to allow the repurposing of parts for other uses. The computer-controlled high-voltage power supply box associated with the project can be used for other common high-voltage applications in Aerosol Science and Technology, such as data acquisition and control systems for scanning mobility particle sizers. Computational fluid dynamics simulations are used to quantify the 3D flow field. The transfer function associated with the partial transmission is characterized through modeling and experiments. The observed transfer function is unique but deviates from the ideal transfer function due to the distortion of the flow near the inlet and the outlet of the device.

In this paper, we took a first step towards redressing this, through a comprehensive review and the design of a low-cost body area network (BAN) made of a set of wearables that allow physiological signals and human movements to be captured simultaneously. We used four different wearables: OpenBCI and three other open-hardware custom-made designs that communicate via bluetooth low energy (BLE) to an external computer-following the edge-computingconcept-hosting applications for data synchronization and storage. We obtained a large number of physiological signals (electroencephalography (EEG), electrocardiography (ECG), breathing rate (BR), electrodermal activity (EDA), and skin temperature (ST)) with which we analyzed internal states in general, but with a focus on stress. The findings show the reliability and feasibility of the proposed body area network (BAN) according to battery lifetime (greater than 15 h), packet loss rate (0% for our custom-made designs), and signal quality (signal-noise ratio (SNR) of 9.8 dB for the ECG circuit, and 61.6 dB for the EDA). Moreover, we conducted a preliminary experiment to gauge the main ECG features for stress detection during rest.","[Castro-Garcia, Juan Antonio; Molina-Cantero, Alberto Jesus; Gomez-Gonzalez, Isabel Maria; Merino-Monge, Manuel] Univ Seville, ETSI Informat, Dept Tecnol Elect, Seville 41012, Spain; [Castro-Garcia, Juan Antonio; Gomez-Gonzalez, Isabel Maria] Univ Seville, I3US, Inst Univ Invest Ingn Informat, Seville 41012, Spain; [Lafuente-Arroyo, Sergio] Univ Alcala, Escuela Politecn Super, Dept Teoria Senal & Comunicac, Alcala De Henares 28801, Spain",University of Sevilla; University of Sevilla; Universidad de Alcala,"Castro-García, JA (corresponding author), Univ Seville, ETSI Informat, Dept Tecnol Elect, Seville 41012, Spain.; Castro-García, JA (corresponding author), Univ Seville, I3US, Inst Univ Invest Ingn Informat, Seville 41012, Spain.",jacastro@us.es; almolina@us.es; igomez@us.es; sergio.lafuente@uah.es; manmermon@dte.us.es,"Merino-Monge, Manuel/S-1209-2018; Castro-García, Juan Antonio/P-7406-2016; Gomez Gonzalez, Isabel M./L-5957-2014","Merino-Monge, Manuel/0000-0003-0204-4544; Castro-García, Juan Antonio/0000-0003-1128-6879; Gomez Gonzalez, Isabel M./0000-0002-6041-1480; Molina, Alberto/0000-0002-2256-0127; Lafuente Arroyo, Sergio/0000-0002-4841-2501",,,,,107,9,9,5,42,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2079-9292,,ELECTRONICS-SWITZ,Electronics,JAN,2022,11,1,,,,,,,155,10.3390/electronics11010155,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/electronics11010155,,,30,"Computer Science, Information Systems; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Physics, Applied",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Computer Science; Engineering; Physics,YH1ZN,,gold,,,2024-08-15,WOS:000742972500001,,,,355

Any up-gradation of the hardware in the existing communication devices is not easier one. Compatibility of the new hardware with existing hardware is highly essential. But the new protocols may or may not support the older one. The solution for these problems can be provided by using the reconfigurable hardware design. The hardware can be reprogrammed according to the new change in technology up-gradation. The cost of commercially available hardware and software requirements for setting up such a module is very high. This can be solved by using Open source hardware and software such as Universal Software Radio Peripheral (USRP) and GNU Radio. This work demonstrates how the modern analog communication system like Community Radio Schemes and Radio Data System (RDS) and digital communication systems such as Simple Digital Video Broadcasting (DVB) and OFDM based data communication can be developed using the Open source hardware USRP1.

Design: We performed a bench study. Setting: Dedicated research room as part of an ICU affiliated to a university hospital. Subjects: We set the lung model with three conditions of resistance and linear compliance for mimicking different respiratory mechanics of representative intensive care unit (ICU) patients. Interventions: The performance of the device was tested using the ASL5000 lung model. Measurements and Main Results: Twenty-seven conditions were tested. All the measurements fell within the +/- 10% limits for the tidal volume (V-T). The volume error was influenced by the mechanical condition (p = 5.9 x 10(-15)) and the PEEP level (P = 1.1 x 10(-12)) but the clinical significance of this finding is likely meaningless (maximum -34 mL in the error). The PEEP error was not influenced by the mechanical condition (p = 0.25). Our experimental results demonstrate that the eSpiro ventilator is reliable to deliver V-T and PEEP accurately in various respiratory mechanics conditions. Conclusions: We report a low-cost, easy-to-build ventilator, which is reliable to deliver V-T and PEEP in passive invasive mechanical ventilation.","[Terzi, Nicolas] Univ Grenoble Alpes, INSERM, U1042, HP2, F-38000 Grenoble, France; [Terzi, Nicolas; Roux, Marion; Sigaud, Florian; Rigault, Guillaume] CHU Grenoble Alpes, Med Intens Reanimat, F-38000 Grenoble, France; [Rastello, Fabrice] Univ Grenoble Alpes, INRIA, Grenoble INP, LIG,CNRS, F-38000 Grenoble, France; [Dehan, Christophe] MinMaxMed SAS, 75 v Gabriel Peri, F-38400 St Martin Dheres, France; [Fromentin, Cyril] FineHeart SAS, Coeur Bersol 28 Ave Gustave Eiffel,Batiment C, F-33600 Pessac, France; [Farrugia, Adrien] SteadXP SAS, F-38000 Grenoble, France; [Guerin, Claude] Hosp Civils Lyon, Hop Edouard Herriot, Grp Hosp Ctr, Med Intens Reanimat, F-69366 Lyon, France; [Guerin, Claude] Univ Lyon, F-69366 Lyon, France; [Guerin, Claude] CNRS, Inst Mondor Rech Biomed, Inserm 955, CNRS,ERL 7000, F-94010 Creteil, France",Institut National de la Sante et de la Recherche Medicale (Inserm); Communaute Universite Grenoble Alpes; Universite Grenoble Alpes (UGA); CHU Grenoble Alpes; Communaute Universite Grenoble Alpes; Institut National Polytechnique de Grenoble; Universite Grenoble Alpes (UGA); Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Inria; CHU Lyon; Universite Gustave-Eiffel; Institut National de la Sante et de la Recherche Medicale (Inserm); Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Universite Paris-Est-Creteil-Val-de-Marne (UPEC),"Terzi, N (corresponding author), Univ Grenoble Alpes, INSERM, U1042, HP2, F-38000 Grenoble, France.; Terzi, N (corresponding author), CHU Grenoble Alpes, Med Intens Reanimat, F-38000 Grenoble, France.",nterzi@chu-grenoble.fr; frastell@gmail.com; christophe.dehan@minmaxmedical.com; MRoux3@chu-grenoble.fr; FSigaud@chu-grenoble.fr; grigault@chu-grenoble.fr; cyril.fromentin@fine-heart.com; adrienfarrugia@yahoo.fr; claude.guerin@chu-lyon.fr,"GUERIN, CLAUDE/IAP-4956-2023; TERZI, Nicolas/AAD-4348-2019","TERZI, Nicolas/0000-0003-4036-6245; Roux, Marion/0009-0004-5913-860X; GUERIN, Claude/0000-0003-4700-6672; Sigaud, Florian/0000-0001-6399-5867",,,,,17,1,1,0,5,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2077-0383,,J CLIN MED,J.

In this study, we describe an imaging system that integrates low-cost and open-source hardware, software and genetic resources. The multi-fluorescence imaging system consists of readily available 470 nm LEDs, a Raspberry Pi camera and a set of filters made with low cost acrylics. This device allows imaging in scales ranging from single colonies to entire plates. We developed a set of genetic components (e.g. promoters, coding sequences, terminators) and vectors following the standard framework of Golden Gate, which allowed the fabrication of genetic constructs in a combinatorial, low cost and robust manner. In order to provide simultaneous imaging of multiple wavelength signals, we screened a series of long stokes shift fluorescent proteins that could be combined with cyan/green fluorescent proteins. We found CyOFP1, mBeRFP and sfGFP to be the most compatible set for 3-channel fluorescent imaging. We developed open source Python code to operate the hardware to run time-lapse experiments with automated control of illumination and camera and a Python module to analyze data and extract meaningful biological information. To demonstrate the potential application of this integral system, we tested its performance on a diverse range of imaging assays often used in disciplines such as microbial ecology, microbiology and synthetic biology. We also assessed its potential use in a high school environment to teach biology, hardware design, optics, and programming. Together, these results demonstrate the successful integration of open source hardware, software, genetic resources and customizable manufacturing to obtain a powerful, low cost and robust system for education, scientific research and bioengineering.

However, for the market segment of stand-alone, self-sustaining small IoT nodes, long-term deployment remains problematic due to the energy-constrained nature of these devices, requiring frequent maintenance. This article introduces Hypnos, an open hardware and software toolkit that aims to balance energy intake and usage through the adaptive sensing rate for low-cost Internet-connected IoT nodes. We describe the hardware architecture of the IoT node, an open hardware board based on the Arduino Uno form-factor packing the energy measurement circuitry, and the associated opensource software library, which interfaces with the sensing node's microcontroller and provides access to the low-level energy measurements. Hypnos comes equipped with a built-in, configurable, modified sigmoid function to regulate duty-cycle frequency based on energy intake and usage, yet developers may also plug in their custom duty/sleep balancing function. An experiment was set up, whereby two identical boards ran for two months: one with the Hypnos software framework and built-in energy-balancing function to regulate sensing rate and the other with fixed sensing rate. The experiment showed that Hypnos is able to successfully balance energy usage and sensing frequency within configurable energy ranges. Hereby, it increases the reliability by avoiding the complete shutdown, while, at the same time, optimizing performance in terms of the average amount of sensor measurements.","[Gonzalez-Perez, Alberto; Casteleyn, Sven] Univ Jaume 1, Inst New Imaging Technol, GEOTEC Res Grp, Castellon De La Plana 12071, Spain",Universitat Jaume I,"Gonzalez-Perez, A (corresponding author), Univ Jaume 1, Inst New Imaging Technol, GEOTEC Res Grp, Castellon De La Plana 12071, Spain.",alberto.gonzalez@uji.es; sven.casteleyn@uji.es,"Casteleyn, Sven/L-7187-2018","Casteleyn, Sven/0000-0003-0572-5716; Gonzalez-Perez, Alberto/0000-0002-9016-9357","Spanish Ministry of Education, Culture and Sports [FPU17/03832]; Ramon y Cajal Programme of the Spanish Government [RYC-2014-16606]","Spanish Ministry of Education, Culture and Sports(Spanish Government); Ramon y Cajal Programme of the Spanish Government(Spanish Government)","The work of Alberto Gonzalez-Perez was supported by the Spanish Ministry of Education, Culture and Sports under Grant FPU17/03832.

Advances in open hardware platforms and off-the-shelf photoplethysmogram (PPG) sensors allow the non-intrusive collection of heart rate data at very low cost. However, the signal is not trivial to analyse, since the morphology of PPG waveforms differs from electrocardiogram (ECG) waveforms and shows different noise patterns. Few validated open source available algorithms exist that handle PPG data well, as most of these algorithms are specifically designed for ECG data. In this paper we present the validation of a novel algorithm named HeartPy, useful for the analysis of heart rate data collected in noisy settings, such as when driving a car or when in a simulator. We benchmark the performance on two types of datasets and show that the developed algorithm performs well. Further research steps are discussed. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

In this regard, Internet of Things (IoT) technologies provide versatile and powerful tools, constituting a modern trend in the design of sensing and data acquisition systems for I-V curve tracing. This paper presents a novel I-V curve tracer based on IoT open-source hardware and software. Namely, a Raspberry Pi microcomputer composes the hardware level, whilst the applied software comprises mariaDB, Python, and Grafana. All the tasks required for curve tracing are automated: load sweep, data acquisition, data storage, communications, and real-time visualization. Modern and legacy communication protocols are handled for seamless data exchange with a programmable logic controller and a programmable load. The development of the system is expounded, and experimental results are reported to prove the suitability and validity of the proposal. In particular, I-V curve tracing of a monocrystalline PV generator under real operating conditions is successfully conducted.","[Gonzalez, Isaias; Portalo, Jose Maria; Calderon, Antonio Jose] Univ Extremadura, Dept Elect Engn Elect & Automat, Ave Elvas S-N, Badajoz 06006, Spain",Universidad de Extremadura,"González, I (corresponding author), Univ Extremadura, Dept Elect Engn Elect & Automat, Ave Elvas S-N, Badajoz 06006, Spain.",igonzp@unex.es; jportalo@alumnos.unex.es; ajcalde@unex.es,"González, Isaías/Y-7300-2018; Calderon Godoy, Antonio Jose/R-4094-2019","González, Isaías/0000-0001-5645-3832; Calderon Godoy, Antonio Jose/0000-0003-2094-209X",European Regional Development Funds FEDER; Junta de Extremadura [IB18041],European Regional Development Funds FEDER(European Union (EU)); Junta de Extremadura,FundingThis project was co-financed by European Regional Development Funds FEDER and by the Junta de Extremadura (IB18041).,,44,15,15,2,10,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,1424-8220,,SENSORS-BASEL,Sensors,NOV,2021,21,22,,,,,,,7650,10.3390/s21227650,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/s21227650,,,22,"Chemistry, Analytical; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Instruments & Instrumentation",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Chemistry; Engineering; Instruments & Instrumentation,XJ0JE,34833725.0,"Green Published, gold",,,2024-08-15,WOS:000726485000001,,,,364

For emerging technologies, such as ambient ionization mass spectrometry (AIMS), the assembly of a functional prototype is often more time-consuming than developing the actual probes. The modification of commercial platforms for testing hardware is usually not possible due to technical and legal restrictions. Therefore, we designed a robotic platform, which is based on RepRap 3D-printer components, and therefore easy to adopt for custom set-ups. Adjustable rails in an aluminium frame construction facilitate the mounting of additional parts such as sensors, probes, or optical components. The Open LabBot uses industry-standard G-code for its control. Its simple syntax facilitates the programming of the movement. We developed two programs for the robot control and mass spectrometry imaging: ""LABI-Imaging"" for synchronizing the robot movements and MS data acquisition and ""RmsiGUI"", a software solution for the complete AIMS workflow. We proved the functionality of the system by the automated sampling and classification of essential oils with a PlasmaChip probe. Further, we performed an AIMSI imaging experiment of a lime slice with laser desorption low-temperature plasma (LD-LTP) ionization, demonstrating the integration of the complete workflow in RmsiGUI.

Not only does soil moisture represent the water available for plant growth but also water table levels can affect crop productivity. Furthermore, monitoring soil saturation and water table levels is essential for an early warning of extreme rainfall situations. However, the measurement of these parameters employing commercial instruments has certain disadvantages, with a high cost of purchase and maintenance. In addition, the handling of commercial devices makes it difficult to adapt them to the specific requirements of farmers or decision-makers. Open-source IoT hardware platforms are emerging as an attractive alternative to developing flexible and low-cost devices. This paper describes the design of a datalogger device based on open-source hardware platforms to register water table levels and soil moisture data for agronomic applications. The paper begins by describing energy-saving and wireless transmission techniques. Then, it summarizes the linear calibration of the phreatimeter sensor obtained with laboratory and field data.

Results have shown that parameters obtained from different beers by only using the RoboBEER can be used for their classification according to quality and fermentation type. Results were compared to sensory analysis techniques using principal component analysis (PCA) and artificial neural networks (ANN) techniques.

From sensory analysis, the PCA explained 67% of the variability and combining RoboBEER and Sensory data, the PCA explained only 59% of data variability. The ANN technique for pattern recognition allowed creating a classification model from the parameters obtained with RoboBEER, achieving 92.4% accuracy in the classification according to quality and fermentation type, which is consistent with the PCA results using data only from RoboBEER. The repeatability and objectivity of beer assessment offered by the RoboBEER could translate into the development of an important practical tool for food scientists, consumers and retail companies to determine differences within beers based on the specific parameters studied.

Sensor-management systems typically perform three fundamental tasks: sample sensors at a specified time or period, save data onto retrievable media, and switch power to components on and off in between sample cycles to conserve battery energy and increase field operation time. These tasks are commonly accomplished through integrating separate off-the-shelf components into the desired system such as: power relays, SD card hardware, Real-Time Clocks (RTCs), and coin cell batteries. To enable faster prototyping, the Openly Published Environmental Sensing Lab abstracted all of these requirements into a single printed circuit board (PCB), Hypnos, that can be included in any project to achieve these commonly-required capabilities: powering on and off connected sensors on a schedule and logging collected data to the removable SD card. The hardware is laid out in a ""Feather"" form factor, a popular configuration in the open-source hardware community, to easily mate with other industry standard products. The onboard RTC acts as an alarm clock that wakes a user-attached microprocessor from low-power sleep modes in between sample cycles. By integrating all these components into a single PCB, we save cost while significantly reducing physical system size. The design as well as a suite of code functions that enable the user to configure all the Hypnos board features are detailed. (C) 2021 The Authors.

The platform includes sensors to measure turbidity, total dissolved solids (TDS), and water temperature as variables that are often collected to assess water quality. The design is extensible for research and monitoring purposes, and all the design files are provided under open-source permissive licenses for further development. System design and operation are discussed for illustrative purposes. A block diagram indicates elements of mechanical, electrical, and software design for this system. The mechanical assembly used to house circuit boards and sensors is designed using 3D printing for rapid prototyping. The electronic circuit board acts as a carrier for an Arduino 32-bit microcontroller board and an associated cellular module along with a GPS for geolocation of water quality measurements. The cellular module permits data transfer for Internet of Things (IoT) functionality. System operation is set up using a command line interface (CLI) and C + + code that allows for calibration coefficients and human-readable transfer functions to be defined so that sensor voltages are related to physical quantities. Data are cached on a secure digital (SD) card for backup. The circuit was calibrated, and system operation assessed by deployment on an urban reservoir. Biogeochemical cycles were identified in the collected data using spectrogram and semivariogram analyses to validate system operation. As a system with hardware and software released under an open source license, the WaterWatcher platform reduces the time and effort required to build and deploy low-cost water quality measurement sensors and provides an example of the basic hardware design that can be used for measurements of water quality.","[Kinar, N.

Large-scale research and commercial applications of these computations are developing rapidly across artificial intelligence fields as diverse as semantic text querying, retrieval of multimedia materials, and prediction of the properties of pharmacological molecules and engineered materials. While vector similarity searching is, at present, predominantly implemented on standard central processing unit (CPU) hardware running optimized indexing algorithms, the interest in massively-parallel computing architectures is increasing. Accordingly, a range of systems based on graphics processing units (GPU) and field-programmable gate arrays (FPGA) have been proposed; however, the availability of the design materials for these systems remains largely confined to a small number of corporations and research institutions. Here, we introduce a fully open-source hardware accelerator for vector similarity searching, based on an array of 21 FPGAs densely intertwined with 42 GB of high-speed dynamic memory and installed on a custom-designed compute node board, which yields an aggregate bandwidth of 33.6 GB/s and can be seamlessly reconfigured to implement nearly arbitrary distance calculations. A novel logic and software architecture, based on a lane-wise organization of independent engines implementing distributed distance calculation and sorting, allows attaining noteworthy query latency and power consumption performance on both single- and multi-node system configurations. The entire circuit board hardware, FPGA logic, and host software design is herein presented and freely provided for unlimited use, supporting open innovation and research in this area.","[Minati, Ludovico; Fandrich, Mick] InterMot Technol Inc, Oregon City, OR 97045 USA; [Minati, Ludovico] Tokyo Inst Technol, Inst Innovat Res, Tokyo Tech World Res Hub Initiat WRHI, Yokohama, Kanagawa 2268503, Japan; [Movsisyan, Vardan; Gyozalyan, Khachatur; Papazyan, Tigran; Makaryan, Hrach; Harutyunyan, Taron; Ghaltaghchyan, Hayk] InterMot Technol LLC, Yerevan 0014, Armenia; [Mccormick, Matthew; Mccormick, Chris] in2H2 Inc, Nearist Ai, Folsom, CA 95630 USA; [Aldrigo, Stefano] Tecno77 SRL, I-36040 Brendola, Italy",Tokyo Institute of Technology,"Minati, L (corresponding author), InterMot Technol Inc, Oregon City, OR 97045 USA.; Minati, L (corresponding author), Tokyo Inst Technol, Inst Innovat Res, Tokyo Tech World Res Hub Initiat WRHI, Yokohama, Kanagawa 2268503, Japan.",lminati@ieee.org,"Minati, Ludovico/R-1076-2017","Minati, Ludovico/0000-0002-2532-1674",,,,,49,0,0,2,10,IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC,PISCATAWAY,"445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA",2169-3536,,,IEEE ACCESS,IEEE Access,,2019,7,,,,,,112269,112283,,10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2934715,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2934715,,,15,"Computer Science, Information Systems; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Telecommunications",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Computer Science; Engineering; Telecommunications,IT4LF,,gold,,,2024-08-15,WOS:000482831700010,,,,373

It requires the appropriate infrastructure for recognizing emotional states and reacting accordingly in runtime. In this paper, we describe the open platform that we have implemented (named AICARP v2) to detect changes in physiological signals that can be associated with stressful situations, and when this happens, it recommends the learner to relax by delivering modulated sensorial support in terms of light, sound, or vibration at a relaxation breath rate. In this way, by taking advantage of ambient intelligence, the learner can perceive the recommended action without interrupting the learning activity (in this case, practicing the oral exam of a second language). The signal acquisition of the system (which combines sensors from Libellium e-Health platform with others integrated ad hoc) has been compared with a commercial system (J&J Engineering I-330-C2), obtaining similar outcomes as to identifying significant changes in the physiological signals when the learner experiments an emotional reaction. However, the cost of AICARP v2 is much lower, and at the same time, it is open hardware and flexible and, thus, has the advantage of providing runtime data processing. User studies have served to evaluate participants' perception of the sensorial support, as well as to calibrate the delivery rule and to evaluate the effectiveness of the support provided to them.","[Santos, Olga C.; Uria-Rivas, Raul; Boticario, Jesus G.] UNED, Dept Artificial Intelligence, aDeNu Res Grp, Madrid 28040, Spain; [Rodriguez-Sanchez, M.

More recently, rodents came to the forefront of these efforts, primarily because of the rich experimental possibilities afforded by modern genetic tools. There is, however, a considerable barrier to entering this field, requiring expertise in engineering, hardware and software development, and significant time and financial commitment. Here, we present a comprehensive, open-source hardware and software solution to implement a head-fixed environment for rodent behaviors (HERBs). Our solution provides access to three frequently used experimental frameworks (two-alternative forced choice, Go-NoGo, or passive sensory stimulus presentation) in a single package. The required hardware can be built at a relatively low cost compared with commercially available solutions, from off-the-shelf components.

Low-cost gas metal arc wire (GMAW)-based 3-D printing enables wire arc additive manufacturing (WAAM) for near net shape applications, but has limited resolution due to the complexities of the arcing process. To begin to monitor and thus control these complexities, the initial designs of the open source GMAW 3-D printer have evolved to include current and voltage monitoring. Building on this prior work, in this study, the design, fabrication and use of the open source arc analyzer is described. The arc analyzer is a multi-sensor monitoring system for quantifying the processing during WAAM, which includes voltage, current, sound, light intensity, radio frequency, and temperature data outputs. The open source arc analyzer is tested here on aluminum WAAM by varying wire feed rate and measuring the resultant changes in the sensor data. Visual inspection and microstructural analysis of the printed samples looking for the presence of porosity are used as the physical indicators of quality. The value of the sensors was assessed and the most impactful sensors were found to be the light and radio frequency sensors, which showed arc extinction events and a characteristic ""good weld"" peak frequency.

Acquiring such a policy on a real robot is a tedious and time-consuming task. This is more challenging in a multi-agent system where individual data may be required from each agent. While training in simulations is the common approach due to efficiency and low-cost, they rarely describe the real world. Consequently, policies trained in simulations and transferred to the real robot usually perform poorly. In this paper, we present a novel real-to-sim-to-real framework to bridge the reality gap for an agent in collective motion of a homogeneous multi-agent system. First, we propose a novel deep neural-network architecture termed Convolutional-Recurrent Network (CR-Net) to capture the complex state transition of an agent and simulate its motion. Once trained with data from one agent, we show that the CR-Net can accurately predict motion of all agents in the group. Second, we propose to invest a limited amount of real data from the agent in a generative model. Then, training the CR-Net with synthetic data sampled from the generative model is shown to be at least equivalent to real data. Hence, the proposed approach provides a sufficiently accurate model with significantly less real data. The generative model can also be disseminated along with open-source hardware for easier usage. We show experiments on ground and underwater vehicles in which multi-agent RL policies are trained in the simulation for collective motion and successfully transferred to the real-world.","[Gurevich, Anton; Bamani, Eran; Sintov, Avishai] Tel Aviv Univ, Sch Mech Engn, Haim Levanon, IL-6997801 Tel Aviv, Israel",Tel Aviv University,"Sintov, A (corresponding author), Tel Aviv Univ, Sch Mech Engn, Haim Levanon, IL-6997801 Tel Aviv, Israel.",antong@mail.tau.ac.il; eranbamani@mail.tau.ac.il; sintov1@tauex.tau.ac.il,"Sintov, Avishai/JAD-0128-2023","Bamani, Eran/0000-0001-5007-3134",,,,,60,0,0,1,9,SPRINGER LONDON LTD,LONDON,"236 GRAYS INN RD, 6TH FLOOR, LONDON WC1X 8HL, ENGLAND",0941-0643,1433-3058,,NEURAL COMPUT APPL,Neural Comput.

While there are open-source solutions that include telemetry, such as EnviroDIY's Mayfly, none presently generate real-time, remotely accessible workbooks (Aufdenkampe et al., 2017; EnviroDIY, 2018). The Openly Published Environmental Sensing (OPEnS) Lab developed the OPEnS Hub, a new approach to using low-power, open-source hardware and software to achieve real-time data logging from the field to the web. The Hub is an order of magnitude less expensive than commercial products, inherently modular and flexible, and aims to reduce technical barriers for users with little programming experience (DeBell, 2019). Data can be collected remotely using a host of transmission protocols to relay data from distributed in situ monitoring devices. The Hub mesh-networks with several nodes and backs up to an onboard microSD card. Telemetry options include 900 MHz Long Range Radio (LoRa) with up to 25 km range and Nordic Radio Frequency (nRF) for higher data rates (Feather, 2018). Ongoing transmissions from the Hub to the internet currently employ Ethernet with potential support for Wi-Fi and the cell network. The Hub engages a dynamic, low-latency portal to Google Sheets via the free Application Programming Interface (API), PushingBox, and an adaptable Google Apps Script. This framework was tested on 12 individual sensors nodes at remote sites in Oregon.

However, since commercially available instruments are limited to droplet manipulation, our work addresses the need for accelerated integration of other components, such as temperature control, that can expand the application domain. Methods: We developed PhageBox-an accessible device that can be used as a biochip extension. At hardware level, PhageBox integrates temperature and electromagnetic control modules. At software level, PhageBox is controlled by embedded software containing a unique model for bio-protocol programming, and a graphical user interface for visual device feedback and operation. Results: To evaluate PhageBox's efficacy for biomedical applications, we performed functional testing. Similarly, we validated the temperature control using thermography, obtaining a range of +/- 0.2 C-degrees . The electromagnets produced a magnetic force of 15 milliTesla, demonstrating precise immobilization of magnetic beads. We show the potential of PhageBox for bacteriophage research through three initial protocols: a universal framework for PCR, T7 bacteriophage restriction enzyme digestion, and concentrating phi X174 RF genomic DNA. Conclusion: Our work presents an open-source hardware and software extension for digital microfluidics devices.

This task can become difficult taking into account that the subject must control all functionalities with the same limb. It can increase the risk of car accident. To reduce this type of distraction, we propose the construction of a prototype to control the functionalities in a car using gestures captured by electromyographic signals. The data is simulated by an Arduino and, afterwards, sent to a Raspberry Pi. Then we perform signal classification using an Extreme Learning Machine. The result of the classification will be used to control automotive functionalities.

Nevertheless, model parameters are usually estimated on the basis of guidelines from user manuals and literature because they are not usually monitored, due to the high cost of conventional monitoring systems. Within this framework, a new and promising generation of low-cost sensors for hydrologic monitoring, logging, and transition has been developed. We aimed to design a low-cost, open-hardware platform, based on a Raspberry Pi and software written in Python 3, for measuring, recording, and wireless data transmission in hydrological monitoring contexts. Moreover, the data are linked to a runoff model, in real time, for flood prevention. Complementarily, it emphasizes the role of the calibration and validation of soil moisture, rain gauges, and water depth sensors in laboratories. It was installed in a small mountain basin. The results showed mean absolute errors of +/- 2.2% in soil moisture, +/- 1 mm in rainfall, and +/- 0.51 cm in water depth measurements; they highlight the potential of this platform for hydrological monitoring and flood risk management.","[Segovia-Cardozo, Daniel A.; Rodriguez-Sinobas, Leonor; Canales-Ide, Freddy; Zubelzu, Sergio] Univ Politecn Madrid, Dept Ingn Agroforestal ETSI Agron Alimentaria & B, Res Grp Hydraul Irrigat, Ciudad Univ S-N, Madrid 28040, Spain",Universidad Politecnica de Madrid,"Segovia-Cardozo, DA (corresponding author), Univ Politecn Madrid, Dept Ingn Agroforestal ETSI Agron Alimentaria & B, Res Grp Hydraul Irrigat, Ciudad Univ S-N, Madrid 28040, Spain.",da.segovia@upm.es; leonor.rodriguez.sinobas@upm.es; freddy.canales.ide@alumnos.upm.es; sergio.zubelzu@upm.es,"Segovia-Cardozo, Daniel A./AAR-2503-2020","Segovia-Cardozo, Daniel A./0000-0002-4110-1823; Canales-Ide, Freddy/0000-0001-9348-6297",Spanish Centro para el Desarrollo Tecnologico Industrial (CDTI) [PCD1820280276]; European Union [CGL2017-83546-C3-3-R],Spanish Centro para el Desarrollo Tecnologico Industrial (CDTI); European Union(European Union (EU)),"This work was supported by the Spanish Centro para el Desarrollo Tecnologico Industrial (CDTI) [grant PCD1820280276] (SMART-HYDRO project) and the European Union (AEI/FEDER, UE) [grant DRAINAGE CGL2017-83546-C3-3-R].",,52,4,4,4,12,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2073-4441,,WATER-SUI,Water,NOV,2021,13,21,,,,,,,3099,10.3390/w13213099,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w13213099,,,19,Environmental Sciences; Water Resources,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Water Resources,WX5DL,,gold,,,2024-08-15,WOS:000718616400001,,,,389

It exploits robust hardware platforms and powerful software development kits to create customized drivers with advanced capabilities. Still, several restrictions may significantly reduce the performance of OpenBCI. These limitations include the need for more effective communication between computers and peripheral devices and more flexibility for fast settings under specific protocols for neurophysiological data. This paper describes a flexible and scalable OpenBCI framework for electroencephalographic (EEG) data experiments using the Cyton acquisition board with updated drivers to maximize the hardware benefits of ADS1299 platforms. The framework handles distributed computing tasks and supports multiple sampling rates, communication protocols, free electrode placement, and single marker synchronization. As a result, the OpenBCI system delivers real-time feedback and controlled execution of EEG-based clinical protocols for implementing the steps of neural recording, decoding, stimulation, and real-time analysis. In addition, the system incorporates automatic background configuration and user-friendly widgets for stimuli delivery. Motor imagery tests the closed-loop BCI designed to enable real-time streaming within the required latency and jitter ranges. Therefore, the presented framework offers a promising solution for tailored neurophysiological data processing.","[Cardona-Alvarez, Yeison Nolberto; Alvarez-Meza, Andres Marino; Castellanos-Dominguez, German] Univ Nacl Colombia, Signal Proc & Recognit Grp, Manizales 170003, Colombia; [Cardenas-Pena, David Augusto] Univ Tecnol Pereria, Automat Res Grp, Pereira 660003, Colombia; [Castano-Duque, German Albeiro] Univ Nacl Colombia, Cultura Calidad Educ Res Grp, Manizales 170003, Colombia",Universidad Nacional de Colombia; Universidad Nacional de Colombia,"Cardona-Alvarez, YN; Alvarez-Meza, AM (corresponding author), Univ Nacl Colombia, Signal Proc & Recognit Grp, Manizales 170003, Colombia.",yencardonaal@unal.edu.co; amalvarezme@unal.edu.co,,"Cardenas-Pena, David/0000-0002-0522-8683; Alvarez-Meza, Andres/0000-0003-0308-9576; Castellanos-Dominguez, German/0000-0002-0138-5489","project ""PROGRAMA DE INVESTIGACION RECONSTRUCCION DEL TEJIDO SOCIAL EN ZONAS DE POSCONFLICTO EN COLOMBIA"" [SIGP 57579, SIGP 58950]; Financiado en el marco de la convocatoria Colombia Cientifica [FP44842-213-2018]","project ""PROGRAMA DE INVESTIGACION RECONSTRUCCION DEL TEJIDO SOCIAL EN ZONAS DE POSCONFLICTO EN COLOMBIA""; Financiado en el marco de la convocatoria Colombia Cientifica","Authors want to thank to the project ""PROGRAMA DE INVESTIGACION RECONSTRUCCION DEL TEJIDO SOCIAL EN ZONAS DE POSCONFLICTO EN COLOMBIA Codigo SIGP: 57579"" con el proyecto de investigacion ""Fortalecimiento docente desde la alfabetizacion mediatica Informacional y la CTel, como estrategia didactico-pedagogica y soporte para la recuperacion de la confianza del tejido social afectado por el conflicto.

The operators will be able to remotely control the machines and in case of handling dangerous material or accidents, there would only be damage to the hardware components. Many of the process parameters can also be read with low-cost probes and devices that can be easily interfaced with microprocessors.

In contrast to other dynamic quadruped robots based on custom actuator and machined metal structural parts, the PADWQ is entirely built from off the shelf components and standard 3D printed plastic structural parts, which allows for a rapid distribution and duplication without the need for advanced machining process. To make sure that the plastic structural parts can withstand the stress of dynamic locomotion, we performed finite element analysis (FEA) on leg structural parts as well as a continuous walking test using the physical robot, both of which the robot has passed successfully. We hope this work to help a wide range of researchers and engineers that need an affordable, highly capable and easily customizable quadruped robot.","[Kim, Joonyoung; Kang, Taewoong; Song, Dongwoon; Yi, Seung-Joon] Pusan Natl Univ, Dept Elect Engn, Busan 46241, South Korea",Pusan National University,"Yi, SJ (corresponding author), Pusan Natl Univ, Dept Elect Engn, Busan 46241, South Korea.",kjykjy98@pusan.ac.kr; touy1@pusan.ac.kr; vehddnsv@pusan.ac.kr; seungjoon.yi@pusan.ac.kr,,"KANG, TAEWOONG/0000-0001-8018-584X; Kim, Joonyoung/0000-0001-8184-7059",,,,,27,5,6,2,27,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2076-3417,,APPL SCI-BASEL,Appl.

Some sensors deployed for these purposes such as temperature, relative humidity, atmospheric pressure, and carbon dioxide sensors require protection from climate factors to avoid bias. Radiation shields hold and protect sensors to avoid this bias, but commercial systems are limited, often expensive, and difficult to implement in low-cost contexts or large deployments for collaborative sensing. To overcome these challenges, this work presents an open source, easily adapted and customized design of a radiation shield. The device can be fabricated with inexpensive off-the-shelf parts and 3-D printed components and can be adapted to protect and isolate different types of sensors. Two material approaches are tested here: polylactic acid (PLA), the most common 3-D printing filament, and acrylonitrile styrene acrylate (ASA), which is known to offer better resistance against UV radiation, greater hardness, and generally higher resistance to degradation. To validate the designs, the two prototypes were installed on a custom outdoor meteorological system and temperature and humidity measurements were made in several locations for one month and compared against a proprietary system and a system with no shield. The 3-D printed materials were also both tested multiple times for one month for UV stability of their mechanical properties, their optical transmission and deformation under outdoor high-heat conditions. The results showed that ASA is the preferred material for this design and that the open source radiation shield could match the performance of proprietary systems. The open source system can be constructed for about nine US dollars, which enables mass development of flexible weather stations for monitoring needed in smart agriculture.(c) 2022 The Author(s).

A capacitive load is used to bias the device due to its versatility and simplicity. The system includes a common part and an interchangeable part that must be designed depending on the electrical characteristics of each PV device. Control software, developed in LabVIEW, controls the equipment, performs automatic campaigns of measurements, and performs additional calculations in real time. These include different procedures to extrapolate the measurements to standard test conditions and methods to obtain the intrinsic parameters of the single diode model. A deep analysis of the uncertainty of measurement is also provided.

The swab was designed using parametric OpenSCAD in two components (a head with engineered break point and various handles), which has several advantages: i) minimizing print time on relatively slow SLA printers, ii) enabling the use of smaller print volume open source SLA printers, iii) reducing the amount of relatively expensive UV resin, and iv) enabling production of handle on more accessible material extrusion 3-D printers. A modular open source UV LED box was designed, fabricated for $45 and tested for batch curing. Swabs can be fabricated for $0.06-$0.12/swab. The results of the mechanical validation tests showed that the swabs could withstand greater forces than would be expected in normal clinical use.

However, it requires precise, sample-dependent increases in excitation power with depth in order to generate contrast in scattering tissue, while minimizing photobleaching and phototoxicity. We show here how adaptive imaging can optimize illumination power at each point in a 3D volume as a function of the sample's shape, without the need for specialized fluorescent labeling. Our method relies on training a physics-based machine learning model using cells with identical fluorescent labels imaged in situ. We use this technique for in vivo imaging of immune responses in mouse lymph nodes following vaccination. We achieve visualization of physiologically realistic numbers of antigen-specific T cells (similar to 2 orders of magnitude lower than previous studies), and demonstrate changes in the global organization and motility of dendritic cell networks during the early stages of the immune response.

The project involves several technological innovations, including portability, high-definition video recording, and multiplatform software support. It was designed for challenging recording environments, and all processing is done offline to allow for optimization of parameter estimation. The pupil and corneal reflection are estimated using a novel forward eye model that simultaneously fits both the pupil and the corneal reflection with full ellipses, addressing a common situation in which the corneal reflection sits at the edge of the pupil and therefore breaks the contour of the ellipse. The accuracy and precision of the system are comparable to or better than what is available in commercial eyetracking systems, with a typical accuracy of less than 0.4A degrees and best accuracy below 0.3A degrees, and with a typical precision (SD method) around 0.3A degrees and best precision below 0.2A degrees. Part of the success of the system comes from a high-resolution eye image. The high image quality results from uncasing common digital camcorders and recording directly to SD cards, which avoids the limitations of the analog NTSC format.

Artificial insemination is an essential approach used to establish hybrid lines and for the operation of sperm repositories. The existing mouth-pipetting technique for artificial insemination of live-bearing fishes has not been substantially upgraded since the first implementation in the 1950s. This work developed a low-cost standardized artificial inseminator device (SAID) as open hardware to address issues routinely encountered in insemination by mouth-pipetting, including lack of reproducibility among different users, difficulty in training, and large, unreportable variation in sample volume and pressure during insemination. Community-level enhancements of the SAID prototype could enable standardized insemination with minimal training and facilitate the participation of research communities in the use of cryopreserved genetic resources. Small-bodied live-bearing fishes attract broad attention because of their importance in biomedical research and critical conservation status in natural habitats. Artificial insemination is an essential process to establish hybrid lines and for the operation of sperm repositories. The existing mouth-pipetting technique for artificial insemination of live-bearing fishes has not been substantially upgraded since the first implementation in the 1950s. The goal of this work was to develop a standardized artificial inseminator device (SAID) to address issues routinely encountered in insemination by mouth-pipetting, including lack of reproducibility among different users, difficulty in training, and large unreportable variation in sample volume and pressure during insemination. Prototypes of the SAID were designed as relatively inexpensive (<USD 80) open hardware based on commercially available and 3-D printed components to enable broad community access. A linear actuator was used to accurately control the position of a piston for fluid transfer with a standard deviation of <0.1 mm over a 4 mm range of travel. The volume of sample transfer was precisely controlled with a linear relationship (r(2) > 0.99) between the piston position and volume. Pressure generation from eight mouth-pipetting operators and SAID prototypes were assessed by pressure sensors. The pressure control by SAID was superior to that produced by mouth-pipetting, yielding lower pressures (31-483 Pa) and smaller variations (standard deviation <11 Pa). These pressures were sufficient to deliver 1-5 mu L of fluid into female reproductive tracts yet low enough to avoid physical injury to fish. Community-level enhancements of the SAID prototype could enable standardized insemination with minimal training and facilitate the participation of research communities in the use of cryopreserved genetic resources.","[Harmon, Elise R.; Liu, Yue; Browning, Valentino; Monroe, William Todd] Louisiana State Univ, Dept Biol & Agr Engn, Baton Rouge, LA 70803 USA; [Harmon, Elise R.; Liu, Yue; Shamkhalichenar, Hamed; Tiersch, Terrence R.] Louisiana State Univ, Aquat Germplasm & Genet Resources Ctr, Sch Renewable Nat Resources, Agr Ctr, Baton Rouge, LA 70820 USA; [Shamkhalichenar, Hamed] Louisiana State Univ, Sch Elect Engn & Comp Sci, Baton Rouge, LA 70803 USA; [Savage, Markita] Texas State Univ, Xiphophorus Genet Stock Ctr, San Marcos, TX 78666 USA",Louisiana State University System; Louisiana State University; Louisiana State University System; Louisiana State University; Louisiana State University System; Louisiana State University; Texas State University System; Texas State University San Marcos,"Monroe, WT (corresponding author), Louisiana State Univ, Dept Biol & Agr Engn, Baton Rouge, LA 70803 USA.",eliseharmon1@gmail.com; yliu@agcenter.lsu.edu; hamed.shamkhali@gmail.com; vdudz1234@gmail.com; markita@txstate.edu; ttiersch@agcenter.lsu.edu; tmonroe@lsu.edu,"Shamkhalichenar, Hamed/Y-6496-2019","Monroe, William Todd/0000-0002-7889-3799; Tiersch, Terrence/0000-0002-7738-1978; Liu, Yue/0000-0003-3838-8277","LSU-ACRES Audubon Center for Research of Endangered Species (LSU-ACRES Collaborative Projects); Louisiana Sea Grant Undergraduate Research Opportunity Program (UROP); National Institutes of Health, Office of Research Infrastructure Programs [R24-OD010441, R24-OD028443]; National Institute of Food and Agriculture, United States Department of Agriculture [LAB94420, NC1194]; Louisiana State University Research & Technology Foundation [AG-2019-LIFT-005]; NIH Office of the Director [R24OD010441] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER","LSU-ACRES Audubon Center for Research of Endangered Species (LSU-ACRES Collaborative Projects); Louisiana Sea Grant Undergraduate Research Opportunity Program (UROP); National Institutes of Health, Office of Research Infrastructure Programs; National Institute of Food and Agriculture, United States Department of Agriculture(United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)); Louisiana State University Research & Technology Foundation; NIH Office of the Director(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH Office of the Director)","This work was supported in part by funding from the LSU-ACRES Audubon Center for Research of Endangered Species (LSU-ACRES Collaborative Projects), the Louisiana Sea Grant Undergraduate Research Opportunity Program (UROP), and the National Institutes of Health, Office of Research Infrastructure Programs (R24-OD010441 and R24-OD028443), with additional support provided by the National Institute of Food and Agriculture, United States Department of Agriculture (Hatch Projects LAB94420 and NC1194), and the Louisiana State University Research & Technology Foundation (AG-2019-LIFT-005).",,50,4,4,0,2,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",2076-2615,,,ANIMALS-BASEL,Animals,APR,2022,12,8,,,,,,,961,10.3390/ani12080961,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ani12080961,,,15,"Agriculture, Dairy & Animal Science; Veterinary Sciences; Zoology",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Agriculture; Veterinary Sciences; Zoology,0Q8DX,35454209.0,"Green Published, gold",,,2024-08-15,WOS:000785143300001,,,,406

In swarm robotics, groups of robots collaborate using local interactions and collectively solve tasks beyond an individual robot's capabilities. Individual robots must have onboard processing, communication, and sensing capabilities to autonomously react to their neighbors and immediate environment. Most research involving UAVs in swarm robotics presents only simulation results, while key landmark studies with real UAV swarms have used UAV platforms that were custom-built for the respective study. One important reason for this is that no commercial UAV platform comes pre-equipped with the ability to identify and track the positions and poses of nearby drones using only onboard sensors and computation, and in research platforms, the relevant sensing technologies are currently under development. Our aim is to provide a platform that allows swarm robotics researchers to test their algorithms on real UAVs, without having to develop their own custom-built UAVs or to wait until more advanced sensing technology is ready off-the-shelf. We provide a well-documented, entirely open-source UAV platform- S-drone (Swarm-drone)-to foster and support UAV swarm research in a laboratory environment. The S-drone uses fiducial markers in the environment and cooperative feature-level sensor fusion for inter-robot tracking to track the presence, identity, relative 2D position, and relative 2D orientation of neighboring peers. The S-drone is suitable for a wide range of contexts, supports quad-camera vision-based navigation and a variety of onboard sensing, and is extensible. It is especially suited for swarm robotics research because it can operate using strictly onboard processing and sensing without the need for global positioning systems, motion capture systems, or ground stations for off-board sensing.","[Oguz, Sinan; Heinrich, Mary Katherine; Allwright, Michael; Zhu, Weixu; Wahby, Mostafa; Dorigo, Marco] Univ Libre Bruxelles ULB, Inst Rech Interdisciplinaires & Dev Intelligence A, B-1050 Brussels, Belgium; [Oguz, Sinan; Garone, Emanuele] Univ Libre Bruxelles ULB, Unite Enseignement Automat & Anal Syst SAAS, B-1050 Brussels, Belgium",Universite Libre de Bruxelles; Universite Libre de Bruxelles,"Oguz, S (corresponding author), Univ Libre Bruxelles ULB, Inst Rech Interdisciplinaires & Dev Intelligence A, B-1050 Brussels, Belgium.; Oguz, S (corresponding author), Univ Libre Bruxelles ULB, Unite Enseignement Automat & Anal Syst SAAS, B-1050 Brussels, Belgium.",sinan.oguz@ulb.be,"; Dorigo, Marco/B-5664-2013","Garone, Emanuele/0000-0003-0419-8483; Dorigo, Marco/0000-0002-3971-0507; OGUZ, Sinan/0000-0003-2832-1239",Program of Concerted Research Actions (ARC) of the Universit libre de Bruxelles,Program of Concerted Research Actions (ARC) of the Universit libre de Bruxelles,No Statement Available,,24,0,0,3,3,IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC,PISCATAWAY,"445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA",2169-3536,,,IEEE ACCESS,IEEE Access,,2024,12,,,,,,43378,43395,,10.1109/ACCESS.2024.3378607,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2024.3378607,,,18,"Computer Science, Information Systems; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Telecommunications",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Computer Science; Engineering; Telecommunications,MF5Z9,,gold,,,2024-08-15,WOS:001192238400001,,,,407

The instrument implements the higher order Campbelling methods and self-monitoring capabilities on an open source development board. The board includes an CPU/FPGA System on a Chip. The feasibility of the measurement instrument was tested both in laboratory with a signal generator and in the Minerve reactor. It is shown that the instrument provides reliable and robust count rate estimation over a wide reactor power range based on the third order statistics of the fission chamber signal. In addition, the system is able to identify whether the measured count rate change is due to the malfunction of the detector or due to the change in the neutron flux. The applied self-monitoring method is based on the spectral properties of the fission chamber signal. During the experimental verification, the considered malfunction was the change of the polarization voltage. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Nonetheless, the costs and issues regarding their implementation and deployment limit the access of the students and educators to their advantages and features such as technical and educational. In this line, this study describes a fully open-source remote laboratory in hardware and software for education in automatic control systems employing Raspberry Pi and Python language with an approximate cost of USD 461. Even, by changing some components, the cost can be reduced to USD 420 or less. To illustrate the functionalities of the labora-tory, we proposed a low-cost tank control system with its respective instrumentation, sig-nal conditioning, identification, and control, which are exposed in this document. However, other experiments can be easily scalable and adaptable to the remote laboratory. Concerning the interface of the laboratory, we designed a complete user-friendly web interface with real-time video for the users to perform the different activities in automatic control such as identification or controller implementation through the programming lan-guage Python. The instructions to build and replicate the hardware and software are indi-cated in the open repositories provided for the project as well as in this paper. Our intention with this project is to offer a complete low-cost and open-source remote labora-tory that can be adapted and used for the students, educators, and stakeholders to learn, experiment, and teach in the field of automatic control systems.

Using a lower cost heat sink reduces the cost to - $6 k. The instrument is suitable for studying ambient ice nucleating particle concentrations and laboratory-based process-level studies of ice nucleation. The design plans allow individuals to self-manufacture the cold-stage using 3D printing, off-the-shelf parts, and a handful of standard tools. Software to operate the instrument and analyze the data is also provided. The design is intended to be simple enough that a graduate student can build it as part of a course or thesis project.

The system is formed by several Nodes (based on the CC3200 microcontroller of Texas Instruments), which are in charge of digitizing the ambient vibrations registered by three-component seismic sensors and transmitting them to a central server. This server records all the received signals, but also allows their real-time visualization in several remote client browsers thanks to the JavaScript's Node.js technology. The data transmission uses not only Wi-Fi technology, but also the existing network resources that nowadays can be found usually in any official or residential building (lowering deployment costs). A data synchronization scheme was also implemented to correct the time differences between the Nodes, but also the long-term drifts found in the internal clock of the microcontrollers (improving the quality of records). The completed system is a low-cost, open-hardware and open-software design.

There are several high temperature printers on the market, but their high costs make them inaccessible for full home-based distributed manufacturing required during pandemic lockdowns. To allow for all these requirements to be met for under $1000, the Cerberus - an open source three-headed self-replicating rapid prototyper (RepRap) was designed and tested with the following capabilities: i) 200 degrees C-capable heated bed, ii) 500 degrees C-capable hot end, iii) isolated heated chamber with 1 kW space heater core and iv) mains voltage chamber and bed heating for rapid start.

Open source scientific hardware enables custom experimentation, laboratory control, rapid upgrading, transparent maintenance, and lower costs in general. To aid in this trend, this study describes the development, design, assembly, and operation of a 3-D printable open source desktop nutating mixer, which provides a fixed 20 degrees platform tilt angle for a gentle three-dimensional (gyrating) agitation of chemical or biological samples (e.g., DNA or blood samples) without foam formation. The custom components for the nutating mixer are designed using open source FreeCAD software to enable customization. All of the non-readily available components can be fabricated with a low-cost RepRap 3-D printer using an open source software tool chain from common thermoplastics. All of the designs are open sourced and can be configured to add more functionality to the equipment in the future. It is relatively easy to assemble and is accessible to both the science education of younger students as well as state-of-the-art research laboratories. Overall, the open source nutating mixer can be fabricated with US$37 in parts, which is 1/10th of the cost of proprietary nutating mixers with similar capabilities.

This allows measurements taken at multiple locations to be compared with confidence. The intended application is wide area electrical power system measurements, in particular phasor measurement units (PMUs). The novelty of the authors' design is the application of an open hardware development platform to discipline a commodity analog-to-digital converter (ADC) to a broadcast time signal, usually but not exclusively GPS. The methodology used creates a driver layer for the ADC to achieve real-time sampling in a nonpreemptive Linux environment. The use of open hardware and software addresses the need for a transparent instrument for use in research and development of PMU technology. Through a choice of either a software or hardware phase-locked loop, the ADC is controlled to acquire exactly 256 samples per nominal power system cycle (i. e., 50/60 Hz), precisely time synchronized to GPS, at 16-b resolution and 94.2-dB SNR. The design of a printed circuit board expansion board featuring all necessary components is provided. The performance of the system is evaluated.

A rapidly growing approach to reduce the costs of scientific equipment is to combine open-source hardware methods with digital distributed manufacturing with 3D printers. Although high-end 3D printers can manufacture vacuum components, again, the cost of access to tooling is economically prohibitive. Low-cost material extrusion 3D printing with plastic overcomes the cost issue, but two problems arise when attempting to use plastic in or as part of vacuum systems: the outgassing of polymers and their sealing. To overcome these challenges, this study explores the potential of using post-processing heat treatments to seal 3D printed polypropylene for use in vacuum environments. The effect of infill overlap and heat treatment with a readily available heat gun on 3D printed PP parts was investigated in detail on ISO-standardized KF vacuum fitting parts and with the use of computer vision-based monitoring of vacuum pump down velocities. The results showed that infill overlap and heat treatment both had a large impact on the vacuum pressures obtainable with 3D printed parts. Heat treatment combined with 98% infill reliably sealed parts for use in vacuum systems, which makes the use of low-cost desktop 3D printers viable for manufacturing vacuum components for open scientific hardware.","[Mayville, Pierce J.; Pearce, Joshua M.] Michigan Technol Univ, Dept Mat Sci & Engn, Houghton, MI 49931 USA; [Petsiuk, Aliaksei L.; Pearce, Joshua M.] Western Univ, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, London, ON N6A 5B9, Canada; [Pearce, Joshua M.] Western Univ, Ivey Business Sch, London, ON N6A 5B9, Canada",Michigan Technological University; Western University (University of Western Ontario); Western University (University of Western Ontario),"Pearce, JM (corresponding author), Michigan Technol Univ, Dept Mat Sci & Engn, Houghton, MI 49931 USA.; Pearce, JM (corresponding author), Western Univ, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, London, ON N6A 5B9, Canada.; Pearce, JM (corresponding author), Western Univ, Ivey Business Sch, London, ON N6A 5B9, Canada.",joshua.pearce@uwo.ca,"Pearce, Joshua/C-9240-2013","Pearce, Joshua/0000-0001-9802-3056",Thompson Endowment; Witte Endowment,Thompson Endowment; Witte Endowment,This work was supported by the Witte and Thompson Endowments.,,64,5,5,1,6,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2504-4494,,J MANUF MATER PROC,J.

Configurable transmit-receive array systems, capable of electronic steering and shaping of the beam in near real-time, are available commercially, for example, for medical imaging. However, emerging applications, such as ultrasonic haptics, parametric audio, or ultrasonic levitation, require only a small subset of the capabilities provided by the existing controllers. To meet this need, we present Ultraino, a modular, inexpensive, and open platform that provides hardware, software, and example applications specifically aimed at controlling the transmission of narrowband airborne ultrasound. Our system is composed of software, driver boards, and arrays that enable users to quickly and efficiently perform research in various emerging applications. The software can be used to define array geometries, simulate the acoustic field in real time, and control the connected driver boards. The driver board design is based on an Arduino Mega and can control 64 channels with a square wave of up to 17 Vpp and pi/5 phase resolution. Multiple boards can be chained together to increase the number of channels. The 40-kHz arrays with flat and spherical geometries are demonstrated for parametric audio generation, acoustic levitation, and haptic feedback.","[Marzo, Asier; Drinkwater, Bruce W.] Univ Bristol, Mech Engn Dept, Bristol BS8 1TR, Avon, England; [Corkett, Tom] Univ Bristol, Elect Engn Dept, Bristol BS8 1TR, Avon, England",University of Bristol; University of Bristol,"Marzo, A (corresponding author), Univ Bristol, Mech Engn Dept, Bristol BS8 1TR, Avon, England.",amarzo.@.hotmail.com; tc13617.@.my.bristol.ac.uk; mebwd.@.bristol.ac.uk,", UpnaLab/AAK-3018-2021","Drinkwater, Bruce W/0000-0002-8307-1175",UK Engineering and Physical Science Research Council [EP/N014197/1]; EPSRC [EP/N014197/1] Funding Source: UKRI,UK Engineering and Physical Science Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)); EPSRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)),This work was supported by the UK Engineering and Physical Science Research Council under Grant EP/N014197/1.,,46,101,110,7,66,IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC,PISCATAWAY,"445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA",0885-3010,1525-8955,,IEEE T ULTRASON FERR,IEEE Trans.

This prototype device employs 18 unique angular measurement positions and a variety of user-selectable LED light sources. The motivation for this project was the need to generate more parameter-rich data sets pertaining to the light-scattering properties of natural sediment suspensions, and to address the issues raised by Kitchener et al. (2017) concerning the inconsistent calibration methodologies currently employed to quantify suspended sediment concentration (SSC) by optical turbidity measurement. The mechanical design comprises re-purposed waste plastic materials and 3D-printed parts. The active light-source control and monitoring hardware and firmware executes on the open-source Arduino embedded microcontroller platform. The modular light sensors plug into any of the angular measurement positions, providing a 0-5 V nominal output signal, which is readable by the user's choice of data-acquisition system. The device will facilitate the highly detailed characterization of suspended sediment samples, providing 18 voltage output channels for analysis by the user. The precise calibration of the light sensors is by the use of neutral density (ND) filters in conjunction with light-source electrical current measurements, providing light-source intensity values as required. The empirical data provided by existing turbidity meters are acquired using incommensurate methodologies, and therefore they are not cross-comparable. A new methodology, described here, facilitates the cross-comparability of turbidity measurements. (C) 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.","[Kitchener, Ben G.

Consequently, the risk of blades breakage by hitting the tower has increased. In order to prevent such incidents, this study proposes a deflection monitoring system that can be installed to already operating wind turbine's blades. The monitoring system is composed of an estimation algorithm to detect blade deflection and a wireless sensor network as a hardware equipment. As for the estimation method for blade deflection, a strain-based estimation algorithm and an objective function for optimal sensor arrangement are proposed. Strain-based estimation algorithm is using a linear correlation between strain and deflections, which can be expressed in a form of a transformation matrix. The objective function includes the terms of strain sensitivity and condition number of the transformation matrix between strain and deflection. In order to calculate the objective function, a simplified experimental model of the blade is constructed by interpolating the mode shape of a blade from modal testing. The interpolation method is effective considering a practical use to operating wind turbines' blades since it is not necessary to establish a finite element model of a blade. On the other hand, a sensor network with wireless connection with an open source hardware is developed. It is installed to a 300 W scale wind turbine and vibration of the blade on operation is investigated. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Sophisticated microscopes allowing optical sectioning for three-dimensional imaging or sub-diffraction resolution are available. Due to price and maintenance issues, these microscopes are often shared between users in facilities. Consequently, long-term access is often prohibited and does not allow to monitor slowly evolving biological systems or to validate new models like organoids. Preliminary coarse long-term data that do not require acquisition of terabytes of high-resolution images are important as a first step. By contrast with expensive all-in-one commercialized stations, standard microscopes equipped with incubator stages offer a more cost-effective solution despite imperfect long-run atmosphere and temperature control. Here, we present the Incubascope, a custom-made compact microscope that fits into a table-top incubator. It is cheap and simple to implement, user-friendly and yet provides high imaging performances. The system has a field of view of 5.5 x 8 mm(2), a 3 mu m resolution, a 10 frames per second acquisition rate, and is controlled with a Python-based graphical interface. We exemplify the capabilities of the Incubascope on biological applications such as the hatching of Artemia salina eggs, the growth of the slime mould Physarum polycephalum and of encapsulated spheroids of mammalian cells.","[Badon, A.; Mombereau, A.; Rivet, L.; Boyreau, A.; Nassoy, P.; Recher, G.] Univ Bordeaux, Lab Photon Numer & Nanosci, LP2N, F-33400 Talence, France; [Badon, A.; Mombereau, A.; Rivet, L.; Boyreau, A.; Nassoy, P.; Recher, G.] Inst Opt, Grad Sch, F-33400 Talence, France; [Badon, A.; Mombereau, A.; Rivet, L.; Boyreau, A.; Nassoy, P.; Recher, G.] CNRS, UMR 5298, F-33400 Talence, France; [Andrique, L.] Univ Bordeaux, TBMCore VoxCell Facil, UMS CNRS 3427, US 005,INSERM, F-33076 Bordeaux, France",Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Universite Paris Saclay; Universite de Bordeaux; Universite de Bordeaux; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); CNRS - Institute of Physics (INP); Universite Paris Saclay; Universite de Bordeaux; Institut National de la Sante et de la Recherche Medicale (Inserm); Universite de Bordeaux,"Badon, A (corresponding author), Univ Bordeaux, Lab Photon Numer & Nanosci, LP2N, F-33400 Talence, France.; Badon, A (corresponding author), Inst Opt, Grad Sch, F-33400 Talence, France.; Badon, A (corresponding author), CNRS, UMR 5298, F-33400 Talence, France.",amaury.badon@institutoptique.fr,"Recher, Gaelle/AAB-8218-2019; Badon, Amaury/I-7016-2019","Recher, Gaelle/0000-0001-9004-0118;","Agence Nationale pour le Rcherche [ANR-7-CE30-0007-03, ANR-17-CE18-0026-02, ANR-17-CE13-0012-01]; Canceropole GSO; SIRIC Brio (Bordeaux); Association pour la Recherche sur le Cancer (ARC); La Ligue Contre le Cancer (Gironde and Pyrenees Atlantiques); Fondation des Treilles; Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR) [ANR-17-CE18-0026, ANR-17-CE13-0012] Funding Source: Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR)",Agence Nationale pour le Rcherche(Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR)); Canceropole GSO; SIRIC Brio (Bordeaux); Association pour la Recherche sur le Cancer (ARC)(Fondation ARC pour la Recherche sur le Cancer); La Ligue Contre le Cancer (Gironde and Pyrenees Atlantiques); Fondation des Treilles; Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR)(Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR)),"This work was supported by the Agence Nationale pour le Rcherche (MecaTiss, ANR-7-CE30-0007-03, Parkington, ANR-17-CE18-0026-02, MecanoAdipo, ANR-17-CE13-0012-01), Canceropole GSO, SIRIC Brio (Bordeaux) and the following charities: Association pour la Recherche sur le Cancer (ARC), La Ligue Contre le Cancer (Gironde and Pyrenees Atlantiques).

Despite the simplicity of this technique the entry price for such machines might be prohibitive, ranging from few hundreds to thousands of Euros. Here we present Maasi, an affordable alternative that is easy to build and has all functional key features to be used in a wide range of applications. Our design has a price of less than hundred Euros and an assembly time of only two hours. One of the key design principles was to use only 3D printed parts in combination with affordable Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) components [1]. Reducing the complexity we use an electronic speed controller (ESC) with telemetry, to eliminate the need for a rotor position sensor [2]. A touchscreen further improves its usability, thus setting a perfect startpoint for the design of other affordable lab tools. The Maasi project includes different 3D printable substrate holders allowing treatment of formats up to 80 mm in diameter. We furthermore validate the Maasi spin coater by measuring its speed accuracy and performance for coating polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) on glass coverslips for mechanobiological assays.

This results in a device that can be considered as a black box, as it is difficult to determine the applied signal processing. This paper presents an open source low-cost active sEMG circuit, allowing an understanding of sEMG and the challenges involved in designing a high quality device. An open source sEMG design reduces the time and cost associated with initial sEMG research, providing a larger number of researchers with the opportunity to utilise sEMG. The device has been tested on three subjects, resulting in a low baseline noise <= 5.2 mu V-rms and great line noise rejection, resulting in a sensitive device that can capture high quality bio-potential signals.

Second, FPGA virtualization and accelerator scheduling techniques are not fully researched for cluster deployment. In this paper, we propose an open-source FPGA-as-a-service (FaaS) platform, the hCODE, to simplify the design, management and deployment of FPGA accelerators at cluster scale. The proposed platform implements a Shell-and-IP design pattern and an open accelerator repository to reduce design and management costs of FPGA projects. Efficient FPGA virtualization and accelerator scheduling techniques are proposed to deploy accelerators on the FPGA-enabled cluster easily. With the proposed hCODE, hardware designers and accelerator users can be organized on one platform to efficiently build open-hardware ecosystem.","[Zhao, Qian; Amagasaki, Motoki; Iida, Masahiro; Kuga, Morihiro; Sueyoshi, Toshinori] Kumamoto Univ, Fac Adv Sci & Technol, Kumamoto 8608555, Japan",Kumamoto University,"Zhao, Q (corresponding author), Kumamoto Univ, Fac Adv Sci & Technol, Kumamoto 8608555, Japan.",cho@arch.cs.kumamoto-u.ac.jp,,,,,,,8,8,11,1,9,IEICE-INST ELECTRONICS INFORMATION COMMUNICATION ENGINEERS,TOKYO,"KIKAI-SHINKO-KAIKAN BLDG, 3-5-8, SHIBA-KOEN, MINATO-KU, TOKYO, 105-0011, JAPAN",1745-1361,,,IEICE T INF SYST,IEICE Trans.

State-of-the-art microcontroller units provide a wide range of ultra-low-power inactive modes with sub-millisecond wakeup time that can be effectively used for this purpose. At the same time they are equipped with 16-bit RISC architectures clocked at tens of MHz, which make them powerful enough to run a Java-compatible virtual machine (VM). This makes it possible to bring the benefits of a virtual runtime environment into power-constrained embedded systems. VMs, however, risk to impair the effectiveness of dynamic power management as they are seen as always-active processes by the scheduler of the operating system in spite of the idleness of the threads running on top of them. Avoiding to keep sensor nodes busy when they could be idle is mandatory for the energetic sustainability of WSNs. While most of the tasks of a sensor node are inherently event-driven, the functioning of its hardware-software components is not, so that they require to be redesigned in order to exploit idleness.

In this paper, collected by a motorized telescope mount was data analyzed using both video observations by trained observers and modernized approaches using computer vision. The more advanced data extraction used the OpenCV library of computer vision tools to identify bird silhouettes by means of image stabilization and background subtraction. The silhouettes were sanitized and analyzed in sequence to produce stacked relationships between temporally close contours, discriminating birds from noise based on the assumption that birds migrate in stable paths. The flight ceiling of the birds was determined by extracting relevant correlation coefficient data from doppler radar co-located with the LunAero instrument in Norman, OK, USA using a method with low-computational overhead. The bird paths and flight ceiling were combined with lunar ephemera to provide input for the original method used for nocturnal migration quantification as well as an enhanced version of the same method with more advanced computational tools. We found that the manual quantification of migration activity detected 16,300 birds/km center dot h heading northwest from 110 degrees, whereas the automated analysis reported a density of 43,794 birds/km center dot h heading northwest from 106.67 degrees. Hence, there was agreement with regard to flight direction, but the automated method overestimated migration density by approximately three times. The reasons for the discrepancy between flight path detection appeared to be due to a substantial amount of noise in the video data as well as a tendency for the computer vision analysis to split single flight paths into two or more segments. The authors discuss ongoing innovations aimed at addressing these methodological challenges.","[Honeycutt, Wesley T.; Bridge, Eli S.] Univ Oklahoma, Oklahoma Biol Survey, 111 Chesapeake, Norman, OK 73019 USA",University of Oklahoma System; University of Oklahoma - Norman,"Honeycutt, WT (corresponding author), Univ Oklahoma, Oklahoma Biol Survey, 111 Chesapeake, Norman, OK 73019 USA.",honeycutt@ou.edu,,"Honeycutt, Wesley/0000-0002-3681-4810",University of Oklahoma Aeroecology University Strategic Initiative; University of Oklahoma Thousands Strong LunAero crowdfunding campaign; National Science Foundation [1840230]; Emerging Frontiers; Direct For Biological Sciences [1840230] Funding Source: National Science Foundation,University of Oklahoma Aeroecology University Strategic Initiative; University of Oklahoma Thousands Strong LunAero crowdfunding campaign; National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Emerging Frontiers; Direct For Biological Sciences(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Biological Sciences (BIO)),"This work was supported by the University of Oklahoma Aeroecology University Strategic Initiative, the University of Oklahoma Thousands Strong LunAero crowdfunding campaign, and the National Science Foundation award [grant number 1840230].",,36,3,3,0,3,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",1540-7063,1557-7023,,INTEGR COMP BIOL,Integr.

The proposed system measures temperature, dissolved oxygen, and pH, taking records and sending information through a wireless protocol (ZigBee) to a graphical user interface which can display information numerically and graphically, as well as simultaneously storing the information in a database. These variables are very important for aquaculture, as they have a direct influence on critical culture parameters such as growth and survival.

The goal of this work was to develop a simple (single-piece and single-layer photolithography) sperm counting chamber (SSCC) for aquatic species. Goldfish (Carassius auratus) and zebrafish (Danio rerio) sperm were used for evaluation in the device, which was created with soft lithography. Four designs with different geometries were evaluated for counting accuracy. Open-corner and open-midpoint designs were the most accurate with no significant differences (P > 0.05) for most of the target sperm concentrations (0.5-1.0 x 10(8) cells/mL). The open-corner design was not significantly different from the Makler (R) counting chamber intended for human sperm cells (P = 0.6) but was significantly different from a hemocytometer (P < 0.001) intended for other cell sizes. Material cost of device production was USD 16 per unit, including photolithography supplies, glass slide and coverslip, and polydimethylsiloxane. The cost can be reduced to USD 2 per unit with repeated wafer casts. This device could be further refined for resin 3-D printing and sharing via open-hardware approaches and modified to best suit species specific applications.","[Belgodere, Jorge A.; Liu, Yue; Reich, Elizabeth L.; Eades, Jason; Monroe, William Todd] Louisiana State Univ, Dept Biol & Agr Engn, Baton Rouge, LA 70803 USA; [Belgodere, Jorge A.; Liu, Yue; Reich, Elizabeth L.; Eades, Jason; Monroe, William Todd] Agr Ctr, Baton Rouge, LA 70803 USA; [Liu, Yue; Tiersch, Terrence R.] Louisiana State Univ, Aquat Germplasm & Genet Resources Ctr, Sch Renewable Nat Resources, Agr Ctr, Baton Rouge, LA 70820 USA",Louisiana State University System; Louisiana State University; Louisiana State University System; Louisiana State University,"Monroe, WT (corresponding author), Louisiana State Univ, Dept Biol & Agr Engn, Baton Rouge, LA 70803 USA.; Monroe, WT (corresponding author), Agr Ctr, Baton Rouge, LA 70803 USA.",tmonroe@lsu.edu,"Eades, Jason/HLG-7394-2023","Monroe, William Todd/0000-0002-7889-3799; Liu, Yue/0000-0003-3838-8277; Belgodere, Jorge/0000-0003-3399-4796; Tiersch, Terrence/0000-0002-7738-1978","National Institutes of Health, Office of Research Infrastructure Programs [R24-OD010441, R24-OD028443]; National Institute of Food and Agriculture, United States Department of Agriculture [LAB94420, NC1194]; United States Agency for International Development [193900.312455.19]; Louisiana Sea Grant Undergraduate Research Opportunity Program (UROP); Louisiana State University Discover Undergraduate Research Grant; Louisiana State University Research & Technology Foundation (LIFT2); LSU-ACRES (Audubon Center for Research of Endangered Species) Collaborative Program; USDA-NAGP-AGGRC Cooperative Agreement [583012-8-006]; NIH Office of the Director [R24OD010441] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER","National Institutes of Health, Office of Research Infrastructure Programs; National Institute of Food and Agriculture, United States Department of Agriculture(United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)); United States Agency for International Development(United States Agency for International Development (USAID)); Louisiana Sea Grant Undergraduate Research Opportunity Program (UROP); Louisiana State University Discover Undergraduate Research Grant; Louisiana State University Research & Technology Foundation (LIFT2); LSU-ACRES (Audubon Center for Research of Endangered Species) Collaborative Program; USDA-NAGP-AGGRC Cooperative Agreement; NIH Office of the Director(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH Office of the Director)","This work was supported in part by funding from the National Institutes of Health, Office of Research Infrastructure Programs (R24-OD010441 and R24-OD028443), with additional support provided by National Institute of Food and Agriculture, United States Department of Agriculture (Hatch project LAB94420 and NC1194), a USDA-NAGP-AGGRC Cooperative Agreement (Award 583012-8-006), United States Agency for International Development (193900.312455.19), Louisiana Sea Grant Undergraduate Research Opportunity Program (UROP), Louisiana State University Discover Undergraduate Research Grant, Louisiana State University Research & Technology Foundation (LIFT2), and LSU-ACRES (Audubon Center for Research of Endangered Species) Collaborative Program.",,47,4,4,0,5,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2410-3888,,FISHES-BASEL,Fishes,OCT,2022,7,5,,,,,,,231,10.3390/fishes7050231,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/fishes7050231,,,14,Fisheries; Marine & Freshwater Biology,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Fisheries; Marine & Freshwater Biology,5O4MW,36644608.0,"gold, Green Accepted",,,2024-08-15,WOS:000872450600001,,,,438

Closed-loop DBS with real-time feedback is gaining attention in recent years, after proved more effective than conventional DBS in terms of pathological symptom control clinically. Here we demonstrate the conceptualization and validation of a closed-loop DBS system using open-source hardware. We used hippocampal theta oscillations as system input, and electrical stimulation in the mesencephalic reticular formation (mRt) as controller output. It is well documented that hippocampal theta oscillations are highly related to locomotion, while electrical stimulation in the mRt induces freezing. We used an Arduino open-source microcontroller between input and output sources. This allowed us to use hippocampal local field potentials (LFPs) to steer electrical stimulation in the mRt. Our results showed that closed-loop DBS significantly suppressed locomotion compared to no stimulation, and required on average only 56% of the stimulation used in open-loop DBS to reach similar effects. The main advantages of open-source hardware include wide selection and availability, high customizability, and affordability. Our open-source closed-loop DBS system is effective, and warrants further research using open-source hardware for closed-loop neuromodulation.","[Wu, Hemmings; Beeckmans, Dorien; van Kuyck, Kris; Nuttin, Bart] Katholieke Univ Leuven, Res Grp Expt Neurosurg & Neuroanat, Leuven, Belgium; [Ghekiere, Hartwin; Tambuyzer, Tim; Aerts, Jean-Marie] Katholieke Univ Leuven, BIORES Measure Model & Manage Bioresponses M3, Dept Biosyst, Leuven, Belgium; [Nuttin, Bart] Univ Hosp Leuven, Dept Neurosurg, Leuven, Belgium",KU Leuven; KU Leuven; KU Leuven; University Hospital Leuven,"Wu, H (corresponding author), Katholieke Univ Leuven, Res Grp Expt Neurosurg & Neuroanat, Leuven, Belgium.",Hemmings.Wu@kuleuven.be,,,"agency for Innovation by Science and Technology (IWT: Baekeland Mandate) [100683]; agency for Innovation by Science and Technology (SBO BrainSTAR); Interdisciplinary Research Programmes of KU Leuven [IDO/12/024]; Research Foundation - Flanders (FWO) [12L4812N, G.0729.09, G.0A55.13]",agency for Innovation by Science and Technology (IWT: Baekeland Mandate)(Institute for the Promotion of Innovation by Science and Technology in Flanders (IWT)); agency for Innovation by Science and Technology (SBO BrainSTAR); Interdisciplinary Research Programmes of KU Leuven; Research Foundation - Flanders (FWO)(FWO),"This study was supported by the agency for Innovation by Science and Technology (IWT: Baekeland Mandate (100683) and SBO BrainSTAR), the Interdisciplinary Research Programmes of KU Leuven (IDO/12/024), and the Research Foundation - Flanders (FWO: 12L4812N, G.0729.09 and G.0A55.13).

Flight time measurement with jump-mat systems is the most common procedure for this purpose. The aim of this study was to analyze the concurrent validity and reliability of two proprietary systems (Globus and Axon) and an open-source system (Chronojump). Methods: A conditioning electric circuit governed by a controlled wave generator is designed to substitute athletes jumping on a physical mat. In order to look for possible differences associated to timekeeping by each microcontroller device, all three systems are fed by the circuit simultaneously. Results: Concurrent validity was high for the three systems. Standarized typical error of estimate (TEE) was trivial, according to MBI interpretation as well as perfect Pearson correlation coefficient. Reliability was assessed based on the coefficient of variation of flight time measure, resulting in 0.17-0.63% (0.05-0.12 cm) for Globus, 0.01% (0.09 cm) for Chronojump and 5.65-9.38% (2.15-3.53 cm) for Axon. These results show that all jump-mat system produced nearly identical measures of flight time so they can be considered valid and reliable for practical purposes. In comparison, Chronojump showed the best performance whereas Axon showed enough variability and disagreement to pose a problem in testing elite athletes. Conclusions: These experiments show that open-source jump mats are as valid and reliable as their proprietary counterparts at a lower cost. Therefore, practitioners can be confident in using Globus or Chronojump systems to test athletes' jump height because of their negligible errors and Axon system to monitor general population.","[Pueo, Basilio; Penichet-Tomas, Alfonso] Univ Alicante, Dept Sport Sci, Ctra San Vicente, Alicante, Spain; [Lipinska, Patrycja; Busko, Krzysztof] Kazimierz Wielki Univ, Inst Phys Culture, Bydgoszcz, Poland",Universitat d'Alacant; Kazimierz Wielki University,"Pueo, B (corresponding author), Univ Alicante, Dept Sports Sci, Comp Sci Res Inst, Ctra San Vicente S-N, Alicante 03690, Spain.",basilio@ua.es,"Lipinska, Patrycja Anna/KVB-7583-2024; Jimenez-Olmedo, Jose M./AAF-2879-2019; Pueo, Basilio/A-8025-2015; Penichet-Tomás, Alfonso/I-3826-2016; Buśko, Krzysztof/ABE-7456-2020; Lipińska, Patrycja/A-8049-2015","Lipinska, Patrycja Anna/0000-0002-8752-2623; Pueo, Basilio/0000-0003-2590-3276; Penichet-Tomás, Alfonso/0000-0003-0018-5589; Buśko, Krzysztof/0000-0002-6456-3502;",,,,,25,25,26,2,13,"WROCLAW UNIV TECHNOLOGY, FAC COMPUTER SCIENCE & MANAGEMENT",WROCLAW,"WYBRZEZE WYSPIANSKIEGO 27, WROCLAW, 50-370, POLAND",1509-409X,,,ACTA BIOENG BIOMECH,Acta Bioeng.

The electromechanical training platform is the core of the system, which acts as a gateway interface of sensors-actuators for a closed loop system, through an immersive virtual reality application, the patient closes the loop by acting as the controller by means of a ""virtual dummy"" preform-ing in mirror configuration.The platform measures and process the dorsiflexion angle described by both ankles, real -time transmitting the information to the mobile phone virtual application to be presented as a mirror. The onboard microprocessor drives the operation of the electric stimulation interface, which is sent through two channels to both, healthy and affected lower limbs.

The complex inner geometry of conventional slot dies require expensive machining that limits accessibility and experimentation. In order to overcome these issues this study follows an open hardware approach, which uses an open source 3-D printer to both fabricate the slot die and then to functionalize a 3-D slot die printing system. Polymer materials are tested and selected for compatibility with common solvents and used to fabricate a custom slot die head. This slot die is then integrated into a 3-D printer augmented with a syringe pump to form an additive manufacturing platform for thin film semiconductor devices. The full design of the slot die system is disclosed here using an open source license including software and operational protocols. This study demonstrates that functional lab-grade slot dies may be 3-D printed using low-cost open source hardware methods A case study using NiO2 found an RMS value 0.486 nm, thickness of 17-49 nm, and a maximum optical transmission of 99.1%, which shows this additive manufacturing approach to slot die depositions as well of fabrication is capable of producing viable layers of advanced electronic materials. Using this method, a cost savings of over 17,000% was obtained when compared to commercial slot die systems for laboratories. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.","[Beeker, L.

Electroencephalographic (EEG) brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) offer a potential communication method for these people without invasive surgery or physical device controls.MethodsAlthough virtual keyboard protocols are well documented in EEG BCI paradigms, these implementations are visually taxing and fatiguing. All English words combine 44 unique phonemes, each corresponding to a unique EEG pattern. In this study, a complete phoneme-based imagined speech EEG BCI was developed and tested on 16 subjects.ResultsUsing open-source hardware and software, machine learning models, such as k-nearest neighbor (KNN), reliably achieved a mean accuracy of 97 +/- 0.001%, a mean F1 of 0.55 +/- 0.01, and a mean AUC-ROC of 0.68 +/- 0.002 in a modified one-versus-rest configuration, resulting in an information transfer rate of 304.15 bits per minute. In line with prior literature, the distinguishing feature between phonemes was the gamma power on channels F3 and F7.DiscussionHowever, adjustments to feature selection, trial window length, and classifier algorithms may improve performance. In summary, these are iterative changes to a viable method directly deployable in current, commercially available systems and software. The development of an intuitive phoneme-based EEG BCI with open-source hardware and software demonstrates the potential ease with which the technology could be deployed in real-world applications.","[Larocco, John] Ohio State Univ, Wexner Med Ctr, Columbus, OH 43210 USA; [Tahmina, Qudsia; Lecian, Sam; Moore, Jason; Helbig, Cole; Gupta, Surya] Ohio State Univ, Dept Elect Engn, Columbus, OH USA",University System of Ohio; Ohio State University; University System of Ohio; Ohio State University,"Larocco, J (corresponding author), Ohio State Univ, Wexner Med Ctr, Columbus, OH 43210 USA.",john.larocco@osumc.edu,,"Larocco, John/0000-0003-2116-5720",IRB [2023H0194],IRB,"The author(s) declare financial support was received for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.

However, neural responses may vary due to prior experience, internal states, or stochastic factors, thus generating the need for methods that can assess neural function across many individuals at once. Whereas most recording techniques examine a single animal at a time, we describe the use of wide-field microscopy to scale up neuronal recordings to dozens of Caenorhabditis elegans or other sub-millimeter-scale organisms at once. Open-source hardware and software allow great flexibility in programming fully automated experiments that control the intensity and timing of various stimulus types, including chemical, optical, mechanical, thermal, and electromagnetic stimuli. In particular, microfluidic flow devices provide precise, repeatable, and quantitative control of chemosensory stimuli with sub-second time resolution. The NeuroTracker semi-automated data analysis pipeline then extracts individual and population-wide neural responses to uncover functional changes in neural excitability and dynamics. This paper presents examples of measuring neuronal adaptation, temporal inhibition, and stimulus crosstalk. These techniques increase the precision and repeatability of stimulation, allow the exploration of population variability, and are generalizable to other dynamic fluorescent signals in small biosystems from cells and organoids to whole organisms and plants.","[White, Hamilton; Kamara, Vanessa; Gorski, Veronika; Busby, Molly; Albrecht, Dirk R.] Worcester Polytech Inst, Dept Biomed Engn, Worcester, MA 01609 USA; [White, Hamilton] UMass Chan Med Sch, Grad Sch Biomed Sci, Worcester, MA USA; [Albrecht, Dirk R.] Worcester Polytech Inst, Dept Biol & Biotechnol, Worcester, MA 01609 USA",Worcester Polytechnic Institute; University of Massachusetts System; UMass Chan Medical School; Worcester Polytechnic Institute,"Albrecht, DR (corresponding author), Worcester Polytech Inst, Dept Biomed Engn, Worcester, MA 01609 USA.; Albrecht, DR (corresponding author), Worcester Polytech Inst, Dept Biol & Biotechnol, Worcester, MA 01609 USA.",dalbrecht@wpi.edu,"kamara, v/JVP-3229-2024","Kamara, Vanessa/0000-0003-3025-8099",National Science Foundation [1724026],National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)),We thank Fox Avery for testing these protocols and reviewing the manuscript and Eric Hall for programming assistance.

Through this type of surgery, one can place needles among other tools within the structures of the brain. Therefore, injections can be given in order to deliver substances that cannot cross the blood-brain barrier. The two most important parameters of the microinjection to control are volume and speed. The volume should not be so large that it displaces the brain tissue and tears it. The injection speed must also be slow so that the liquid that comes out of the syringe can diffuse into the tissue without displacing it and damaging it. Thus, the objec-tives of the present work are: 1) To develop not a 3D printed prototype but an end-user device. 2) The device must be for animal research only. 3) It must have the same precision in volume and speed as commercial devices. 4) It must be adjustable for microsyringes from 0.5 ll to 1 ml. 5) It must be possible to place it directly on the stereotaxic surgery apparatus and to use it separately. 6) The price must be substantially lower than that of the commercial devices.& COPY; 2023 The Authors.

The system is based on open-source hardware and delivers an open-source code for an adaptive Kalman filter to enhance positioning precision for data quality assurance at an outdoor experimental site. The results demonstrate that the system can deliver reliable trajectories for low-mobility objects. To mitigate accident risk and severity, varied cycling speed calming measures are tested at an experimental site. Based on the trajectory data, the statistical features of cycling velocities are evaluated and compared.

To achieve standardization of sperm activation, microfluidic mixers have shown improved reproducibility over activation by hand, but challenges remain in optimizing and simplifying the use of these microdevices for greater adoption. The device described herein incorporates a novel micromixer geometry that aligns two sperm inlet streams with modified herringbone structures that split and recombine the sample at a 1:6 dilution with water to achieve rapid and consistent initiation of motility. The polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) chip can be operated in a positive or negative pressure configuration, allowing a simple micropipettor to draw samples into the chip and rapidly stop the flow. The device was optimized to not only activate zebrafish sperm but also enables practical use with standard computer-assisted sperm analysis (CASA) systems.

Construction of the corresponding layer deposition paths is performed according to locally-defined material density, encoded in the form of a voxel part model. Specific algorithms for constructing a single layer deposition path by joining elementary deposition paths of semi-random or standard shape are developed and tested. Computational tests of the developed algorithmic procedures indicate that the associated computer processing time, is comparable to that implied by conventional slicing and path planning techniques.

Hence, to achieve these objectives, we developed a low-cost and open-source portable monitor (PM) device capable of acquiring electroencephalographic (EEG) signals using the popular ESP32 microcontroller. The device operates based on instrumentation amplifiers. It also has a connectivity microcontroller with Wi-Fi and Bluetooth that can be used to stream EEG signals. This portable single-channel 3-electrode EEG device allowed us to record short naps and score different sleep stages, such as wakefulness, non rapid eye movement sleep (NREM), stage 1 (S1), stage 2 (S2), stage 3 (S3) and stage 4 (S4). We validated the device by comparing the obtained signals to those generated by a research-grade counterpart.

Yet in much of the developing world, prohibitive costs are a substantial barrier to universal access. One area where this is clear is surgical fracture tables, which generally cost >US$200,000 new. With the advent of 3-D printing, a new way to reduce medical equipment costs is to use open source hardware licensed designs to fabricate digitally-distributed manufactured medical hardware. That approach is applied here to make surgical tables more accessible. This study describes the design and manufacture of an open source surgical fracture table that uses materials that are widely available worldwide with specialty components being 3-D printed. The bill of materials and assembly instructions are detailed and the fracture table is validated to perform mechanically to specifications. Using an open source desktop RepRap-class 3-D printer, the components can be printed in a little over a week of continuous printing. Including the 3-D printed parts, the open source fracture table can be constructed for under US$3,000 in material costs, representing a 98.5% savings for commercial systems, radically increasing accessibility. The open source table can be adjusted 90-116 cm in height, tilted from +/-15 degrees, the leg height ranges from 31 to 117 cm, the arm supports and foot holder both have a 180-degree range, the foot position has a 54 cm range, and the legs can be adjusted from 55 to 120 degrees. It is mechanically adjusted so does not require electricity, however, surgical staff need to be trained on how to perform needed adjustments during surgery. The open source surgical table has verified performance for mechanical loading over 130 kg, geometric flexibility to allow for wide array of common surgeries, is radiolucent in surgical zones, and is modular and upgradeable.","[Bow, J.

Rapidly evolving clinical and scientific requirements have created a need for hardware and software that can be customized for specific applications. Hardware may require customization to enable a variety of recording types (e.g., electroencephalogram, local field potentials, or multi-unit activity) while meeting the stringent and costly requirements of MRI safety and compatibility. Real-time signal processing tools are an enabling technology for studies of learning, attention, sleep, epilepsy, neurofeedback, and neuropharmacology, yet real-time signal processing tools are difficult to develop. We describe an open-source system for simultaneous electrophysiology and fMRI featuring low-noise (< 0.6 mu V p-p input noise), electromagnetic compatibility for MRI (tested up to 7T), and user-programmable real-time signal processing. The hardware distribution provides the complete specifications required to build an MRI-compatible electrophysiological data acquisition system, including circuit schematics, print circuit board (PCB) layouts, Gerber files for PCB fabrication and robotic assembly, a bill of materials with part numbers, data sheets, and vendor information, and test procedures. The software facilitates rapid implementation of real-time signal processing algorithms. This system has been used in human EEG/fMRI studies at 3 and 7T examining the auditory system, visual system, sleep physiology, and anesthesia, as well as in intracranial electrophysiological studies of the non-human primate visual system during 3T fMRI, and in human hyperbaric physiology studies at depths of up to 300 feet below sea level.

Our aim was to design and test an affordable and easy-to-build noninvasive bilevel pressure ventilator to allow a reduction in the serious shortage of ventilators in LMICs. Methods: The ventilator was built using off-the-shelf materials available via e-commerce and was based on a high-pressure blower, two pressure transducers and an Arduino Nano controller with a digital display (total retail cost <75 USD), with construction details provided open source for free replication. The ventilator was evaluated, and compared with a commercially available device (Lumis 150 ventilator; Resmed, San Diego, CA, USA): 1) in the bench setting using an actively breathing patient simulator mimicking a range of obstructive/restrictive diseases; and b) in 12 healthy volunteers wearing high airway resistance and thoracic/abdominal bands to mimic obstructive/restrictive patients. Results: The designed ventilator provided inspiratory/expiratory pressures up to 20/10 cm H2O, respectively, with no faulty triggering or cycling; both in the bench test and in volunteers. The breathing difficulty score rated (1-10 scale) by the loaded breathing subjects was significantly (p<0.005) decreased from 5.45 +/- 1.68 without support to 2.83 +/- 1.66 when using the prototype ventilator, which showed no difference with the commercial device (2.80 +/- 1.48; p=1.000). Conclusion: The low-cost, easy-to-build noninvasive ventilator performs similarly to a high-quality commercial device, with its open-source hardware description, which will allow for free replication and use in LMICs, facilitating application of this life-saving therapy to patients who otherwise could not be treated.","[Garmendia, Onintza; Rodriguez-Lazaro, Miguel A.; Otero, Jorge; Navajas, Daniel; Farre, Ramon] Univ Barcelona, Fac Med & Ciencies Salut, Unitat Biofis & Bioengn, Barcelona, Spain; [Garmendia, Onintza; Montserrat, Josep M.] Univ Barcelona, Hosp Clin, Sleep Lab, Barcelona, Spain; [Otero, Jorge; Navajas, Daniel; Montserrat, Josep M.; Farre, Ramon] CIBER Enfermedades Resp, Madrid, Spain; [Phuong Phan] Hue Cent Hosp, Hue, Vietnam; [Stoyanova, Alexandrina] Univ Barcelona, Fac Econ & Business, Dept Econ, Barcelona, Spain; [Anh Tuan Dinh-Xuan] Hop Cochin, AP HP, Serv Physiol Explorat Fonct, Paris, France; [Gozal, David] Univ Missouri, Dept Child Hlth, Sch Med, Columbia, MO 65201 USA; [Navajas, Daniel] Barcelona Inst Sci & Technol, Inst Bioengn Catalonia IBEC, Barcelona, Spain; [Montserrat, Josep M.; Farre, Ramon] Inst Invest Biomed August Pi Sunyer, Barcelona, Spain",University of Barcelona; University of Barcelona; Hospital Clinic de Barcelona; CIBER - Centro de Investigacion Biomedica en Red; CIBERES; University of Barcelona; Assistance Publique Hopitaux Paris (APHP); Universite Paris Cite; Hopital Universitaire Cochin - APHP; University of Missouri System; University of Missouri Columbia; University of Barcelona; Barcelona Institute of Science & Technology; Institut de Bioenginyeria de Catalunya; University of Barcelona; Hospital Clinic de Barcelona; IDIBAPS,"Farré, R (corresponding author), Fac Med & Ciencies Salut, Unitat Biofis & Bioengn, Casanova 143, Barcelona 08036, Spain.",,"Navajas, Daniel/E-4233-2010; Gozal, David/ABH-3805-2020; DINH-XUAN, Anh Tuan/A-9691-2008; Farre, Ramon/L-2664-2017","Navajas, Daniel/0000-0001-7150-9363; DINH-XUAN, Anh Tuan/0000-0001-8651-5176; Farre, Ramon/0000-0002-9084-7824; Petrova Stoyanova, Alexandrina/0000-0003-3238-0055; Gozal, David/0000-0001-8195-6036",,,,,37,43,47,0,8,EUROPEAN RESPIRATORY SOC JOURNALS LTD,SHEFFIELD,"442 GLOSSOP RD, SHEFFIELD S10 2PX, ENGLAND",0903-1936,1399-3003,,EUR RESPIR J,Eur.

Common approaches for measuring liquid intake in real time include computer-tethered lickometers or video-based systems. Additionally, liquids can be measured or weighed to determine the amount consumed without real-time sensing. Here, we built a photobeam-based sipper device that has the following advantages over traditional methods: (1) it is battery powered and fits in vivarium caging to allow home-measurements; (2) it quantifies the intake of two different liquids simultaneously for preference studies; (3) it is low cost and easily constructed, enabling high-throughput experiments; and (4) it is open source so that others can modify it to fit their experimental needs. We validated the performance of this device in three experiments. First, we calibrated our device using time-lapse video-based measurements of liquid intake and correlated sipper interactions with liquid intake. Second, we used the sipper device to measure preference for water versus chocolate milk, demonstrating its utility for two-bottle choice tasks. Third, we integrated the device with fiber photometry, establishing its utility for measuring neural activity in studies of ingestive behavior. This device requires no special equipment or caging, and is small, battery powered, and wireless, allowing it to be placed directly in rodent home cages. The total cost of fabrication is less than $100, and all design files and code are open source.

Samples were instrumentally processed in a relatively short time, and neither an intentional reduction of the linear flow rate nor an unconventional fluorescence instrument were required. Through the inclusion of external circuitry based on open-source hardware, the occurrence time of each individual fluorescence intensity reading was recorded. For the reported instrumental setup, irregular signal sampling was verified. In order to consider samples-specific time measurements, the PARAFAC (Parallel Factor Analysis) algorithm, and the derived APARAFAC (Augmented-PARAFAC) strategy, were adapted. The functional information was employed during the computational stages, through the development and implementation of smoothing strategies. To tackle differences between the rate of spectral acquisition and the rate of change in the concentration of the mobile fluorophores, Expectation Maximization was implemented. Data from samples with one calibrated analyze (Vitamin B6-Pyridoxine), in presence of uncalibrated interferents, were modeled. In order to preserve the original data structure, unfolding data operations were minimized. The resolved profiles of all species were in agreement with the corresponding chromatographic and spectral references. Results suggest that the effects derived from the loss of trilinearity previously reported in the literature for LC-EEM data, depend on interpretation and subsequent modeling of the data. The reported strategies can be useful with other flow techniques and kinetics.","[Siano, Gabriel G.; Giovanini, Leonardo L.] FICH UNL CONICET, Sinc I, Inst Invest Senales Sistemas & Inteligencia Com, Ciudad Univ UNL,S3000ZAA, Santa Fe, Argentina; [Siano, Gabriel G.] FBCB UNL, Catedra Quim Analit 2, Ciudad Univ UNL,S3000ZAA, Santa Fe, Argentina; [Vera Candioti, Luciana] FBCB UNL, Catedra Bromatol & Nutr, Ciudad Univ UNL,S3000ZAA, Santa Fe, Argentina; [Vera Candioti, Luciana] Consejo Nacl Invest Cient & Tecn, Godoy Cruz 2290,C1425FQB, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina",National University of the Littoral; National University of the Littoral; Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Cientificas y Tecnicas (CONICET),"Siano, GG (corresponding author), FICH UNL CONICET, Sinc I, Inst Invest Senales Sistemas & Inteligencia Com, Ciudad Univ UNL,S3000ZAA, Santa Fe, Argentina.",gsiano@sinc.unl.edu.ar,,,"CONICET (Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Cientificas y Tecnicas) [PIP-2015, 0111]",CONICET (Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Cientificas y Tecnicas)(Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Cientificas y Tecnicas (CONICET)),"The authors express their gratitude to CONICET (Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Cientificas y Tecnicas, Project PIP-2015 No. 0111) for financially supporting this work.

The usage of idle TV channels in the Television Ultra High Frequencies (TV-UHF) band (500-698 MHz), also known as Television White Spaces (TVWS), is a relatively new and promising concept for wireless connectivity that can be used to cater to the demand. A challenge in this setting is to figure out a fast and cost-effective method of TVWS presence estimation, such as the use of open hardware and software tools, reducing sensing time. This article proposes a Rapid Estimation Method (REM) for TVWS estimation that uses the statistical information of the sensed signals. Our probabilistic approach analyzes the collected parameters of more than eight million data samples taken by scanning the TV-UHF spectrum in the city of Windsor, ON, Canada. The calculated statistical parameters and a group of auxiliary parameters were combined to estimate rapidly the amount of TVWS available in the sensed locations. By applying the proposed rapid estimation method, the presence of TVWS was identified and verified with an accuracy of about 76% according to the results obtained, the average variation when comparing the calculated and detected probabilities of TVWS was in a range of 15%, and the method could be a viable solution to the spectrum need.","[Corral-De-Witt, Danilo; Ahmed, Sabbir; Tepe, Kemal] Univ Windsor, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, Windsor, ON N9B 3P4, Canada; [Corral-De-Witt, Danilo] Univ Fuerzas Armadas ESPE, Dept Elect & Elect, Sangolqui 171103, Ecuador; [Rojo-Alvarez, Jose Luis] Univ Rey Juan Carlos, Dept Teoria Senal & Comunicac Sistemas Telemat & C, Madrid 28933, Spain",University of Windsor; Escuela Politecnica Superior del Ejercito; Universidad Rey Juan Carlos,"Corral-De-Witt, D (corresponding author), Univ Windsor, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, Windsor, ON N9B 3P4, Canada.; Corral-De-Witt, D (corresponding author), Univ Fuerzas Armadas ESPE, Dept Elect & Elect, Sangolqui 171103, Ecuador.",corraldd@uwindsor.ca; sabbir1009@yahoo.com; joseluis.rojo@urjc.es; ktepe@uwindsor.ca,"Rojo-Álvarez, Jose Luis/F-6520-2016","Rojo-Álvarez, Jose Luis/0000-0003-0426-8912","Secretaria de Educacion Superior, Ciencia, Tecnologia e Innovacion (SENESCYT) of Ecuador; University of Windsor","Secretaria de Educacion Superior, Ciencia, Tecnologia e Innovacion (SENESCYT) of Ecuador; University of Windsor","This work was supported by the Secretaria de Educacion Superior, Ciencia, Tecnologia e Innovacion (SENESCYT) of Ecuador and the University of Windsor.

Given that advent of Internet of Things (IoT) era due to mobile technology progressions, the future needs a sorting method that is available on any environment, such as not only high performance systems like servers but also low computational performance machines like embedded systems. In this paper, we present an FPGA-based sorting accelerator combining Sorting Network and Merge Sorter Tree, which is customizable by means of tuning design parameters. The proposed FPGA accelerator sorts data sent from a host PC via the PCIe bus, and sends back the fully sorted data sequence to it. We also present a detailed analytical model that accurately estimates the sorting performance. Due to these characteristics, designers can know how fast a developed sorting hardware is in advance and can implement the best one to fulfill the cost and performance constraints. Our experiments show that the proposed hardware achieves up to 19.5x sorting performance, compared with Intel Core i7-3770K operating at 3.50GHz, when sorting 256M 32-bits integer elements. However, this result is limited because of insufficient memory bandwidth. To overcome this problem, we propose a data compression mechanism and the experimental result shows that the sorting hardware with it achieves almost 90% of the estimated performance, while the hardware without it does about 60%. In order to allow every designer to easily and freely use this accelerator, the RTL source code is released as open-source hardware.","[Kobayashi, Ryohei] Univ Tsukuba, Ctr Computat Sci, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3053577, Japan; [Kise, Kenji] Tokyo Inst Technol, Grad Sch Informat Sci & Engn, Tokyo 1528552, Japan",University of Tsukuba; Tokyo Institute of Technology,"Kobayashi, R (corresponding author), Univ Tsukuba, Ctr Computat Sci, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3053577, Japan.",kobayashi@cs.tsukuba.ac.jp; kise@cs.titech.ac.jp,"Kise, Kenji/B-9296-2015; Kobayashi, Ryohei/GVT-0939-2022","Kobayashi, Ryohei/0000-0003-2175-9828",,,,,24,4,4,0,1,IEICE-INST ELECTRONICS INFORMATION COMMUNICATION ENGINEERS,TOKYO,"KIKAI-SHINKO-KAIKAN BLDG, 3-5-8, SHIBA-KOEN, MINATO-KU, TOKYO, 105-0011, JAPAN",0916-8532,1745-1361,,IEICE T INF SYST,IEICE Trans.

This thermal situation has important consequences for animal behavior. The explanation is based on the fact that the relationship between the body area of the small animal and that of the adult, gives a greater value than the relationship between the respective volumes. Representative aluminum pieces are used to model the phenomenon, and open hardware is used to perform the temperature measurements in a calorimetry experiment.

Indirect low frequency ultrasonic energy (US), using baths, has been recently proposed as an effective alternative for crude oil demulsification. However, the reactor position during sonication and its influence on the demulsification efficiency for crude oil has not been evaluated. In this sense, the aim of this study was to develop an automated system based on an open source hardware for mapping the acoustic field distribution in an US bath operating at 35 kHz using a hydrophone. Data acquired with this system provided information to evaluate the demulsification efficiency in the different positions of the US bath and correlate it with the acoustic intensity distribution. The automated 3D-mapping system revealed a higher acoustic intensity in the regions immediately above the transducers (ca. 0.6 W cm(-2)), while the other regions presented a relatively lower intensity (ca. 0.1 W cm(-2)). Experimental data demonstrated that reactors positioned in the most intense acoustic regions provided a much higher efficiency of demulsificadon in comparison with the ones positioned in the less intense acoustic field regions. Demulsification efficiency up to 93% was obtained with 15 min of sonication (100% amplitude) using few amount of chemical demulsifier. Hence, this work demonstrated that the information acquired with the developed mapping system could be used for inducing a higher efficiency of demulsification only by finding the more suitable position of reactor in the US bath, which certainly will help development of appropriate reactors design when looking for such approach.","[Pedrotti, Matheus F.] Univ Fed Santa Maria, Dept Engn Quim, BR-97105900 Santa Maria, RS, Brazil; [Enders, Michele S.

The fabrication of a laminated Delta robot with prismatic actuation is presented to exemplify this process. A working device with actuation and functional components such as linear guides, stepper motors and limit switches is designed and fully realized. Because the mechanism is popped out of the plane to achieve its 3D shape, we present a stiffness analysis to arrive at the out-of-plane (or 'pop-out') angles that the planar system must accommodate so that constraints/limits on actuator torque/force can be can satisfied while producing an operational system.

An automated high-throughput protocol was developed demonstrating the synthesis of CdSe nanocrystals using sonochemistry and different combinations of sample conditions, including precursor and ligand compositions and concentrations. Cavitation caused by ultrasound fields causes local and transient increases in temperature and pressure sufficient to drive the decomposition of organometallic precursors to drive the chemical reaction leading to nanocrystal formation. A total of 625 unique sample conditions were prepared and analyzed in triplicate with an individual sample volume of as little as 0.5 mL, which drastically reduced chemical waste and experimental times. The rapid onset of cavitation and quick dissipation of energy result in fast nucleation with little nanocrystal growth leading to the formation of small nanocrystals or magic-size clusters (MSCs) depending on composition. Using the effective mass approximation, the calculated QD diameters obtained under all our experimental conditions ranged between 1.3 and 2.1 nm, which was also validated with small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS). Polydispersity, QD shape and optical properties largely varied depending on the concentration of ligands present in solution. Statistical analysis of the spectroscopic data corroborates the qualitative relationships observed from the optical characterization of the samples with the model-agnostic SHAP analysis. The complete workflow relies on relatively low-cost and open-source systems. Automation and the reduced volumes also allow for cost-efficient experimentation, increasing the accessibility of this MAP. The high-throughput capabilities of the automated sonication platform, the extensible nature of the Jubilee system, and the modular nature of the protocol, make the workflow adaptable to a variety of future studies, including other nanocrystal design spaces, emulsification processes, and nanoparticle re-dispersion or exfoliation. A sonochemical Materials Acceleration Platform was implemented to synthesize CdSe nanocrystals under 625 unique conditions (in triplicate) in less than 6 weeks. The modularity of the workflow is adaptable to a variety of applications.","[Politi, Maria; Baum, Fabio; Vaddi, Kiran; Antonio, Edwin; Bishop, Brittany P.; Holmberg, Vincent C.; Pozzo, Lilo D.] Univ Washington, Dept Chem Engn, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Vasquez, Joshua; Peek, Nadya] Univ Washington, Dept Human Ctr Design & Engn, Seattle, WA USA",University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle; University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle,"Pozzo, LD (corresponding author), Univ Washington, Dept Chem Engn, Seattle, WA 98195 USA.",dpozzo@uw.edu,,"Politi, Maria/0000-0002-5815-3371; Pozzo, Lilo/0000-0001-7104-9061","This project was supported by the National Science Foundation through NSF-CBET grant no. 1917340, the Data Intensive Research Enabling Clean Technology (DIRECT) National Science Foundation (NSF) National Research Traineeship (DGE-1633216), and the UW Molec [1917340]; National Science Foundation through NSF-CBET [DGE-1633216]; Data Intensive Research Enabling Clean Technology (DIRECT) National Science Foundation (NSF) National Research Traineeship [DMR-1719797]; UW Molecular Engineering Materials Center [DMR-2116265]; U.S. National Science Foundation through the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) program; University of Washington, Department of Chemical Engineering; Joint Center for Deployment and Research in Earth Abundant Materials; state of Washington through the University of Washington Clean Energy Institute; UW eScience Institute","This project was supported by the National Science Foundation through NSF-CBET grant no. 1917340, the Data Intensive Research Enabling Clean Technology (DIRECT) National Science Foundation (NSF) National Research Traineeship (DGE-1633216), and the UW Molec; National Science Foundation through NSF-CBET; Data Intensive Research Enabling Clean Technology (DIRECT) National Science Foundation (NSF) National Research Traineeship; UW Molecular Engineering Materials Center; U.S. National Science Foundation through the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) program(National Science Foundation (NSF)); University of Washington, Department of Chemical Engineering; Joint Center for Deployment and Research in Earth Abundant Materials; state of Washington through the University of Washington Clean Energy Institute; UW eScience Institute","This project was supported by the National Science Foundation through NSF-CBET grant no. 1917340, the Data Intensive Research Enabling Clean Technology (DIRECT) National Science Foundation (NSF) National Research Traineeship (DGE-1633216), and the UW Molecular Engineering Materials Center, a Materials Research Science and Engineering Center (Grant No. DMR-1719797).

This raises costs and retards innovation. Open-source hardware tools exist for implementing these processes individually; however, they are not easily integrated with other designs. The Broadly Reconfigurable and Expandable Automation Device (BREAD) is a framework that provides many open-source devices which can be connected to create more complex data acquisition and control systems. This article explores the feasibility of using BREAD plug-and-play open hardware to quickly design and test monitoring and control electronics for an industrial materials processing prototype pyrolysis reactor. Generally, pilot-scale pyrolysis plants are expensive custom designed systems. The plug-and-play prototype approach was first tested by connecting it to the pyrolysis reactor and ensuring that it can measure temperature and actuate heaters and a stirring motor. Next, a single circuit board system was created and tested using the designs from the BREAD prototype to reduce the number of microcontrollers required. Both open-source control systems were capable of reliably running the pyrolysis reactor continuously, achieving equivalent performance to a state-of-the-art commercial controller with a ten-fold reduction in the overall cost of control. Open-source, plug-and-play hardware provides a reliable avenue for researchers to quickly develop data acquisition and control electronics for industrial-scale experiments.","[Hafting, Finn K.; Pearce, Joshua M.] Western Univ, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, 1151 Richmond St N, London, ON N6A 3K7, Canada; [Kulas, Daniel; Chipkar, Sarvada; Wisniewski, Stefan; Shonnard, David] Michigan Technol Univ, Dept Chem Engn, 1400 Townsend Dr, Houghton, MI 49931 USA; [Michels, Etienne] Michigan Technol Univ, Dept Biomed Engn, 1400 Townsend Dr, Houghton, MI 49931 USA; [Pearce, Joshua M.] Western Univ, Ivey Sch Business, 1151 Richmond St N, London, ON N6A 3K7, Canada",Western University (University of Western Ontario); Michigan Technological University; Michigan Technological University; Western University (University of Western Ontario),"Pearce, JM (corresponding author), Western Univ, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, 1151 Richmond St N, London, ON N6A 3K7, Canada.; Pearce, JM (corresponding author), Western Univ, Ivey Sch Business, 1151 Richmond St N, London, ON N6A 3K7, Canada.",fhafting@uwo.ca; dgkulas@mtu.edu; ebmichel@mtu.edu; sgwisnie@mtu.edu; drshonna@mtu.edu; joshua.pearce@uwo.ca,"; Pearce, Joshua/C-9240-2013","Kulas, Daniel/0000-0003-3165-3816; Pearce, Joshua/0000-0001-9802-3056; Chipkar, Sarvada/0000-0002-5525-5321",Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency,Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency(United States Department of DefenseDefense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA)),No Statement Available,,67,0,0,1,1,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2079-9292,,ELECTRONICS-SWITZ,Electronics,DEC,2023,12,24,,,,,,,4893,10.3390/electronics12244893,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/electronics12244893,,,19,"Computer Science, Information Systems; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Physics, Applied",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Computer Science; Engineering; Physics,DG6N6,,"Green Published, gold",,,2024-08-15,WOS:001130915600001,,,,469

The sensor is a first at a cost of less than USD 50, which is well suited to previously cost-prohibited high-resolution monitoring schemes. This use case is further supported by its out-of-water operation, which provides low-effort installations and longer maintenance-free intervals when compared with in-water sensors. The inclusion of both velocity and depth measurement capabilities allows the sensor to also be used as an all-in-one solution for flowrate measurement. We discuss the design of the sensor, which has been made freely available under open-hardware and open-source licenses. The design uses commonly available electronic components, and a 3D-printed casing makes the design easy to replicate and modify. Not before seen on a hydrology sensor, we include a 3D-printed radar lens in the casing, which boosts radar sensitivity by 21 dB. The velocity and depth-sensing performance were characterised in laboratory and in-field tests. The depth is accurate to within & PLUSMN;6% and & PLUSMN;7 mm and the uncertainty in the velocity measurements ranges from less than 30% to 36% in both laboratory and field conditions.

The comparatively low cost and no-fluid-contact design of peristaltic pumps make them the go-to systems for such ventures, but using commercially available pumping systems this still becomes a costly endeavor at typically $250-$1000 per pump line. Here we have developed an alternative, a peristaltic pump that can be fabricated in most research laboratories using 3D-printing and readily available off-the-shelf parts. The pump features 8 parallel channels with linear ranges spanning from 0.7 mL/min to 6 mL/min. The pump can be fabricated and assembled by anyone with access to a 3D-printer at a cost of less than $45 per channel and is driven by a stepper motor that connects directly to any computer. This device has the potential to be disruptive in areas such as drug screening and assay development, as well as lab-on-a-chip applications and cell cultivation, where it significantly reduces hardware expenses and allows for construction of more comprehensive fluidic systems at a fraction of current costs.

The main characteristic of the OpenSWAP vehicles is their ability of following pre-defined routes with high accuracy under acceptable weather and sea conditions. This would open the door to 4D (repeated) surveys, which constitute a powerful tool to analyze morphological and stratigraphic changes of the sediment/water interface and of the shallow substratum eventually caused by sediment dynamics (erosion vs. deposition), slumps and gravitative failures, earthquakes (slip along seismogenic faults and secondary effects of shaking), tsunamis, etc. The low cost and the open hardware/software architectures of these systems, which can be modified by the end users, lead for planning and execution of cooperative and adaptive surveys with different instruments not yet implemented or tested.

Mechanosensitive ion channels (MSCs), especially ones of Piezo family (Piezo1 and Piezo2), play a crucial role in mechanotransduction. These transmembrane proteins directly react to mechanical cues by triggering the onset of an ionic current. The relevance of this mechanism in driving physiology and pathology is emerging, and there is a growing need for the identification of an affordable and reliable assay to measure it. Setting up a mechanosensitivity assay requires exerting a mechanical stimulus on single cells while observing the downstream effects of channels opening. We propose an open-hardware approach to stimulate single adherent cells through controlled microindentation, using a 3D-printed actuation platform. We validated the device by measuring the mechanosensitivity of a neural mice cell line where the expression level and activity of Piezo1 were genetically and pharmacologically manipulated. Moreover, this extremely versatile device could be integrated with different read-out technologies, offering a new tool to improve the understanding of mechanotransduction in living cells.","[Capponi, Giulio; Neri, Igor; Cottone, Francesco; Mattarelli, Maurizio] Univ Perugia, Dipartimento Fis & Geol, I-06100 Perugia, Italy; [Capponi, Giulio; Zambito, Martina; Florio, Tullio] Univ Genoa, Sez Farmacol, Dipartimento Med Interna, I-16132 Genoa, Italy; [Vassalli, Massimo] Univ Glasgow, James Watt Sch Engn, Glasgow G12 8LT, Lanark, Scotland; [Caponi, Silvia] Univ Perugia, Ist Officina Mat, Italian Natl Res Council IOM CNR, Unit Perugia,Dept Phys & Geol, Via A Pascoli, I-06123 Perugia, Italy; [Florio, Tullio] Osped Policlin San Martino, Ist Ricovero & Cura Carattere Sci, I-16132 Genoa, Italy",University of Perugia; University of Genoa; University of Glasgow; Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche (CNR); Istituto Officina dei Materiali (IOM-CNR); University of Perugia,"Capponi, G (corresponding author), Univ Perugia, Dipartimento Fis & Geol, I-06100 Perugia, Italy.; Capponi, G; Florio, T (corresponding author), Univ Genoa, Sez Farmacol, Dipartimento Med Interna, I-16132 Genoa, Italy.; Vassalli, M (corresponding author), Univ Glasgow, James Watt Sch Engn, Glasgow G12 8LT, Lanark, Scotland.; Florio, T (corresponding author), Osped Policlin San Martino, Ist Ricovero & Cura Carattere Sci, I-16132 Genoa, Italy.",giulio.capponi@studenti.unipg.it; massimo.vassalli@glasgow.ac.uk; tullio.florio@unige.it,"Neri, Igor/F-1482-2010; Florio, Tullio/A-2211-2012; CAPONI, SILVIA/F-9821-2010; Mattarelli, Maurizio/C-5337-2008; Vassalli, Massimo/F-6762-2011","Neri, Igor/0000-0002-9047-9822; Florio, Tullio/0000-0002-2394-996X; Zambito, Martina/0009-0006-3970-172X; COTTONE, FRANCESCO/0000-0003-4920-5907; CAPONI, SILVIA/0000-0002-4219-3256; Mattarelli, Maurizio/0000-0001-9184-7968; Vassalli, Massimo/0000-0002-3063-4376; Capponi, Giulio/0000-0003-1491-9483",European Social Fund (ESF)-Regione Liguria (POR FSE 2014-2020); Royal Society International Exchange [nR2 n202232],European Social Fund (ESF)-Regione Liguria (POR FSE 2014-2020)(European Social Fund (ESF)); Royal Society International Exchange(Royal Society),This research was co-funded by the European Social Fund (ESF)-Regione Liguria (POR FSE 2014-2020).

A trainer for online laparoscopic surgical skills assessment based on the performance of experts and nonexperts is presented. The system uses computer vision, augmented reality, and artificial intelligence algorithms, implemented into a Raspberry Pi board with Python programming language. Methods. Two training tasks were evaluated by the laparoscopic system: transferring and pattern cutting. Computer vision libraries were used to obtain the number of transferred points and simulated pattern cutting trace by means of tracking of the laparoscopic instrument. An artificial neural network (ANN) was trained to learn from experts and nonexperts' behavior for pattern cutting task, whereas the assessment of transferring task was performed using a preestablished threshold. Four expert surgeons in laparoscopic surgery, from hospital Raymundo Abarca Alarcon, constituted the experienced class for the ANN. Sixteen trainees (10 medical students and 6 residents) without laparoscopic surgical skills and limited experience in minimal invasive techniques from School of Medicine at Universidad Autonoma de Guerrero constituted the nonexperienced class. Data from participants performing 5 daily repetitions for each task during 5 days were used to build the ANN. Results. The participants tend to improve their learning curve and dexterity with this laparoscopic training system. The classifier shows mean accuracy and receiver operating characteristic curve of 90.98% and 0.93, respectively. Moreover, the ANN was able to evaluate the psychomotor skills of users into 2 classes: experienced or nonexperienced. Conclusion. We constructed and evaluated an affordable laparoscopic trainer system using computer vision, augmented reality, and an artificial intelligence algorithm. The proposed trainer has the potential to increase the self-confidence of trainees and to be applied to programs with limited resources.","[Alonso-Silverio, Gustavo A.; Bruno-Sanchez, Raul; Alarcon-Paredes, Antonio] Univ Autonoma Guerrero, Chilpancingo, Guerrero, Mexico; [Perez-Escamirosa, Fernando] Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Ciudad De Mexico, Mexico; [Ortiz-Simon, Jose L.] Inst Tecnol Nuevo Laredo, Nuevo Laredo, Tamaulipas, Mexico; [Munoz-Guerrero, Roberto; Minor-Martinez, Arturo] Inst Politecn Nacl, Ciudad De Mexico, Mexico",Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico; Instituto Politecnico Nacional - Mexico,"Alarcón-Paredes, A (corresponding author), Univ Autonoma Guerrero, Sch Engn, Av Lazaro Cardenas S-N,Ciudad Univ Zona Sur, Chilpancingo 39087, Guerrero, Mexico.",aalarcon@uagro.mx,"Pérez-Escamirosa, Fernando/AAS-7435-2020; Alarcón-Paredes, Antonio/Q-6353-2018; Minor, Arturo AMM/I-2943-2017","Pérez-Escamirosa, Fernando/0000-0001-7886-8692; Alarcón-Paredes, Antonio/0000-0002-9785-1252; Alonso-Silverio, Gustavo A/0000-0002-2699-140X",National Council of Science and Technology of Mexico,National Council of Science and Technology of Mexico(Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia (CONACyT)),"The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This work was financially supported by the National Council of Science and Technology of Mexico in a way of scholarship for Raul Bruno-Sanchez.",,42,32,33,3,34,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",1553-3506,1553-3514,,SURG INNOV,Surg.

The robot can then use this categorization to autonomously detect the current state of the droplet and respond. The robot is programmed to visually track the droplet and either inject more chemical fuel to sustain a motile state or introduce a new chemical component that results in a state change (e.g., division). Coupling inexpensive open source hardware with sensing and feedback allows for replicable real-time manipulation and monitoring of nonequilibrium systems that would be otherwise tedious, expensive, and error-prone.

The complexity involved in researching and building soft robots often stems from the interconnectedness of design and control aspects, which are rarely addressed together as a unified problem. To address such complex interdependencies in soft robotics, the Sorotoki toolkit provides a comprehensive and modular programming environment composed of seven Object-Oriented classes. These classes are designed to work together to solve a wide range of soft robotic problems, offering versatility and flexibility for its users. We provide here a comprehensive overview of the Sorotoki software architecture to highlight its usage and applications. The details and interconnections of each module are thoroughly described, collectively explaining how to gradually introduce modeling complexity for various soft robotic scenarios. The effectiveness of Sorotoki is also demonstrated through a range of case studies, including novel problem scenarios and established works widely recognized in the soft robotics community. These case studies cover a broad range of research problems, including: inverse design of soft actuators, passive and active soft locomotion, object manipulation with soft grippers, meta-materials, model reduction, model-based control of soft robots, and online shape estimation. Additionally, the toolkit provides access to four open-hardware soft robotic systems that can be fabricated using commercially available 3D printers.

In this paper, a low-cost, computer-aided, and geophone-based system designed to record, monitor, and analyze three-component microtremor data is presented. This proposed system is not a simple data acquisition system. It is also an integrated system developed to interpret the microtremor data using the horizontal-to-vertical spectral ratio (H/V) method without any external software. Therefore, the H/V peak frequency and amplitude can be easily estimated using this system. The proposed system has several features such as a 200 Hz sampling frequency, approximately 72 dB dynamic range, text data format, and data analysis tools. This system consists of a graphical user interface developed by using the .NET Framework 4.5.2 and external hardware that includes signal conditioning circuits, voltage converter circuit, external analog-to-digital converter, and Arduino Uno board. The proposed system uses low-cost vertical and horizontal geophones with a 4.5 Hz natural frequency to measure three-component microtremor data. The developed software undertakes many tasks such as communication between the external hardware and computer, transferring, monitoring, and recording the seismic data to the computer, and interpretation of the recorded data using the Nakamura method. Channel consistency and internal noise measurement tests were performed to demonstrate the accuracy and precision of the proposed system. The proposed system was compared to a commercial triaxial digital seismograph, and satisfactory results were obtained. The developed system is a completely open-source and open-hardware system and can be easily used in academic studies conducted by researchers and university students who are interested in seismic ambient noise analysis.","[Kafadar, Ozkan] Kocaeli Univ, Dept Comp Programming, TR-41140 Kocaeli, Turkey",Kocaeli University,"Kafadar, O (corresponding author), Kocaeli Univ, Dept Comp Programming, TR-41140 Kocaeli, Turkey.",okafadar@kocaeli.edu.tr,"KAFADAR, ÖZKAN/F-6475-2018",,,,,,20,10,10,2,7,COPERNICUS GESELLSCHAFT MBH,GOTTINGEN,"BAHNHOFSALLEE 1E, GOTTINGEN, 37081, GERMANY",2193-0856,2193-0864,,GEOSCI INSTRUM METH,Geosci.

Acquiring gameplay in a scanner remains challenging due to the lack of a scanner-compatible videogame controller that provides a similar experience to standard, commercial devices. In this paper, we introduce a videogame controller designed for use in the functional magnetic resonance imaging as well as magnetoencephalography. The controller is made exclusively of 3D-printed and commercially available parts. We evaluated the quality of our controller by comparing it to a non-MRI compatible controller that was kept outside the scanner. The comparison of response latencies showed reliable button press accuracies of adequate precision. Comparison of the subjects' motion during fMRI recordings of various tasks showed that the use of our controller did not increase the amount of motion produced compared to a regular MR compatible button press box. Motion levels during an ecological videogame task were of moderate amplitude. In addition, we found that the controller only had marginal effect on temporal SNR in fMRI, as well as on covariance between sensors in MEG, as expected due to the use of non-magnetic building materials. Finally, the reproducibility of the controller was demonstrated by having team members who were not involved in the design build a reproduction using only the documentation. This new videogame controller opens new avenues for ecological tasks in fMRI, including challenging videogames and more generally tasks with complex responses. The detailed controller documentation and build instructions are released under an Open Source Hardware license to increase accessibility, and reproducibility and enable the neuroimaging research community to improve or modify the controller for future experiments.","[Harel, Yann; Cyr, Andre; Boyle, Julie; Pinsard, Basile; Bellec, Pierre] Inst Univ Geriatr Montreal, Ctr Rech, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [Harel, Yann; Boyle, Julie; Jerbi, Karim; Bellec, Pierre] Univ Montreal, Psychol Dept, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [Cyr, Andre; Boyle, Julie; Pinsard, Basile; Jerbi, Karim; Bellec, Pierre] Inst Univ Geriatr Montreal, Ctr Rech, Unite Neuroimagerie Fonct, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [Bernard, Jeremy; Fourcade, Marie-France] CEA, Neurospin, Gif Sur Yvette, France; [Aggarwal, Himanshu; Ponce, Ana Fernanda; Thirion, Bertrand] Univ Paris Saclay, Inria, CEA, Palaiseau, France; [Jerbi, Karim] MILA, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [Jerbi, Karim] Univ Montreal, MEG Imaging Ctr, Montreal, PQ, Canada",Universite de Montreal; Universite de Montreal; Universite de Montreal; CEA; Universite Paris Saclay; Universite Paris Cite; CEA; Inria; Universite de Montreal,"Harel, Y (corresponding author), Inst Univ Geriatr Montreal, Ctr Rech, Montreal, PQ, Canada.; Harel, Y (corresponding author), Univ Montreal, Psychol Dept, Montreal, PQ, Canada.",yann.harel@umontreal.ca,,"Thirion, Bertrand/0000-0001-5018-7895","The authors would like to thank the MEG Imaging Center, the Functional Neuroimaging Unit at CRIUGM and the Courtois NeuroMod scanning crews for acquiring the data.","The authors would like to thank the MEG Imaging Center, the Functional Neuroimaging Unit at CRIUGM and the Courtois NeuroMod scanning crews for acquiring the data.","The authors would like to thank the MEG Imaging Center, the Functional Neuroimaging Unit at CRIUGM and the Courtois NeuroMod scanning crews for acquiring the data.",,33,0,0,1,2,PUBLIC LIBRARY SCIENCE,SAN FRANCISCO,"1160 BATTERY STREET, STE 100, SAN FRANCISCO, CA 94111 USA",1932-6203,,,PLOS ONE,PLoS One,Nov 1,2023,18,11,,,,,,,e0290158,10.1371/journal.pone.0290158,http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0290158,,,21,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Science & Technology - Other Topics,X8YI8,37910557.0,"gold, Green Published",,,2024-08-15,WOS:001101239700022,,,,480

However, the aggregate environmental benefits of distributed manufacturing are not clear due to scale reductions and the potential for increases in embodied energy. To quantify the environmental impact of distributed manufacturing using 3D printers, a life cycle analysis was performed on three plastic products. The embodied energy and emissions from conventional large-scale production in low-labor cost countries and shipping are compared to experimental measurements on a RepRap with and without solar photovoltaic (PV) power fabricating products with acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS) and polylactic acid (PLA). The results indicate that the cumulative energy demand of manufacturing polymer products can be reduced by 41-64% (55-74% with PV) and concomitant emission reductions using distributed manufacturing with existing low-cost open-source 3D printers when using <25% fill PIA. Less pronounced positive environmental results are observed with ABS, which demands higher temperatures for the print bed and extruder. Overall, the results indicate that distributed manufacturing using open-source 3D printers has the potential to have a lower environmental impact than conventional manufacturing for a variety of products.","[Kreiger, Megan; Pearce, Joshua M.] Michigan Technol Univ, Dept Mat Sci & Engn, Houghton, MI 49931 USA; [Pearce, Joshua M.] Michigan Technol Univ, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, Houghton, MI 49931 USA",Michigan Technological University; Michigan Technological University,"Pearce, JM (corresponding author), 601 M&M Bldg,1400 Townsend Dr, Houghton, MI 49931 USA.",pearce@mtu.edu,"Pearce, Joshua/D-2052-2010","Pearce, Joshua/0000-0001-9802-3056; Kreiger, Megan/0000-0002-9721-9513",Sustainable Futures Institute,Sustainable Futures Institute,"The authors would like to acknowledge helpful discussions with D.

The system has been used to record changes in temperature and humidity inside hives and assess bees' thermoregulation adaptability within colonies in hives with opened-screened bottom boards; an interesting management tool for controlling the harmful Varroa destructor mite as compared to beehives with conventional closed bottom boards. The results revealed that bee colonies were able to thermoregulate in hives with open anti-Varroa bottom boards to the same degree as those in conventional bottom board hives even under winter conditions in a mediterranean climate, thus indicating that there are no additional risks associated with the use of open-screened bottom board models.

The physical dimensions of the microscope body are 45 x 45 x 31.5 mm (W x L x H), and the control voltage does not exceed 15 V, ensuring the safety of operators, particularly those with limited experience. During performance verification, we conducted a scanning tunneling scan on a Highly Oriented Pyrolytic Graphite (HOPG) sample, utilizing bias voltages of 50 mV and 60 mV, resulting in clear observations of the atomic features of HOPG within the STM pattern.","[Ma, Weilin] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Opt & Elect, Chengdu 610209, Peoples R China; [Ma, Weilin] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China","Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Optics & Electronics, CAS; Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, CAS","Ma, WL (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Opt & Elect, Chengdu 610209, Peoples R China.",maweilin22@mails.ucas.edu.cn,,"Ma, Weilin/0009-0009-7105-8692",,,,,28,0,0,3,3,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",,2468-0672,,HARDWAREX,HardwareX,MAR,2024,17,,,,,,,,e00504,10.1016/j.ohx.2023.e00504,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ohx.2023.e00504,,Jan 2024,16,"Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Instruments & Instrumentation; Materials Science, Multidisciplinary",Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI),Engineering; Instruments & Instrumentation; Materials Science,IB2Z8,38293568.0,"Green Submitted, gold, Green Published",,,2024-08-15,WOS:001163809800001,,,,483

The EyeTrackers and Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs) are suitable systems for those people but their main drawback is their cost. More affordable devices are capable of detecting voluntary blinks and translating them into a binary signal that allows the selection, for example, of an ideogram on a communication board. We tested four different systems based on infrared, bioelectrical signals (Electro-Oculography (EOG) and Electro-Encephalography (EEG)), and video processing. The experiments were performed by people with/without disabilities and analyzed the systems' performances, usability, and method of voluntary blinking (long blinks or sequence of two short blinks). The best accuracy (99.3%) was obtained using Infrared-Oculography (IR-OG) and the worst with the EEG headset (85.9%) and there was a statistical influence of the technology on accuracy. Regarding the method of voluntary blinking, the use of long or double blinks had no statistical influence on accuracy, excluding EOG, and the time taken to perform double blinks was shorter, resulting in a potentially much faster interface. People with disabilities obtained similar values but with greater variability. The preferred technology and blinking methods were Video-Oculography (VOG) and long blinks, respectively. The several Open-Source Hardware (MEW) devices have been developed and a new algorithm for detecting voluntary blinks has also been proposed, which outperforms most of the published papers in the reviewed literature.","[Molina-Cantero, Alberto J.; Lebrato-Vazquez, Clara; Merino-Monge, Manuel; Quesada-Tabares, Roylan; Castro-Garcia, Juan A.; Gomez-Gonzalez, Isabel M.] Univ Seville, ETS Ingn Informat, Dept Elect Technol, E-41012 Seville, Spain",University of Sevilla,"Molina-Cantero, AJ (corresponding author), Univ Seville, ETS Ingn Informat, Dept Elect Technol, E-41012 Seville, Spain.",almolina@us.es,"Molina, Alberto/L-6399-2014; Merino-Monge, Manuel/S-1209-2018; Castro-García, Juan Antonio/P-7406-2016; Gómez-González, Isabel M./L-5957-2014; Vázquez, Clara Lebrato/AAE-7134-2019","Molina, Alberto/0000-0002-2256-0127; Merino-Monge, Manuel/0000-0003-0204-4544; Castro-García, Juan Antonio/0000-0003-1128-6879;",,,,,98,10,12,0,5,IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC,PISCATAWAY,"445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA",2169-3536,,,IEEE ACCESS,IEEE Access,,2019,7,,,,,,70770,70798,,10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2919324,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2919324,,,29,"Computer Science, Information Systems; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Telecommunications",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Computer Science; Engineering; Telecommunications,ID9WE,,gold,,,2024-08-15,WOS:000472037100001,,,,484

For example, researcher-developed sensors, such as audio and video loggers, are being increasingly attached to wildlife tracking collars to provide insights into a range of topics from species interactions to physiology. However, such devices are often prohibitively power-intensive, relative to conventional wildlife collar sensors, and their retrieval without compromising long-term data collection and animal welfare remains a challenge. We present an open-source system (SensorDrop) for remotely detaching individual sensors from wildlife collars. SensorDrop facilitates the retrieval of power-intensive sensors while leaving non-resource-intensive sensors intact on animals. SensorDrop systems can be made using commercially available components and are a fraction of the cost of other timed drop-off devices that detach full wildlife tracking collars. From 2021 to 2022, eight SensorDrop units were successfully deployed on free-ranging African wild dog packs in the Okavango Delta as part of audio-accelerometer sensor bundles attached to wildlife collars. All SensorDrop units detached after 2-3 weeks and facilitated the collection of audio and accelerometer data while leaving wildlife GPS collars intact to continue collecting locational data (>1 year), critical for long-term conservation population monitoring in the region. SensorDrop offers a low-cost method to remotely detach and retrieve individual sensors from wildlife collars. By selectively detaching battery-depleted sensors, SensorDrop maximizes the amount of data collected per wildlife collar deployment and mitigates ethical concerns on animal rehandling. SensorDrop adds to the growing body of open-source animal-borne technologies being utilized by wildlife researchers to innovate and expand upon data collection practices and supports the continued ethical use of novel technologies within wildlife studies.","[Rafiq, K.; Abrahms, B.] Univ Washington, Ctr Ecosyst Sentinels, Dept Biol, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Rafiq, K.; Abrahms, B.] Botswana Predator Conservat, Maun, Botswana; [Appleby, R.

It is usually measured using expensive laboratory equipment. This method, which gives information about the material, is also used quite a lot in medical applications. However, laboratory equipment used in this measurement is often costly. Low-cost laboratory equipment for data acquisition with open-source hardware and software is a lifesaver for the low-budget research projects. Although there are many data acquisition hardware and software in the market, most of them are complex and expensive. They contain many extra features other than some specific ones required for transmission rate measurement. In this study, X-ray transmission rate measurement of some chemical compounds was carried out using a low-cost laboratory counter and data acquisition software. The results are shown by experiments and are consistent with the catalogue values of the materials and chemical compounds used. Thus, in this paper a method is proposed for both measuring the thickness of the material with known linear attenuation coefficient and measuring the linear attenuation coefficient for a material with known thickness.","[Zengin, Aydin Tarik] Istanbul Sabahattin Zaim Univ, Fac Engn, Comp Sci Dept, Halkali Cad 2, TR-34303 Istanbul, Turkey",Istanbul Sabahattin Zaim University,"Zengin, AT (corresponding author), Istanbul Sabahattin Zaim Univ, Fac Engn, Comp Sci Dept, Halkali Cad 2, TR-34303 Istanbul, Turkey.",tarik.zengin@izu.edu.tr,"ZENGIN, AYDIN TARIK/ABF-8916-2020","ZENGIN, AYDIN TARIK/0000-0002-0860-4509",,,,,42,0,0,0,3,TAYLORS UNIV SDN BHD,SELANGOR,"1 JALAN SS15-8, SUBANG JAYA, SELANGOR, 47500, MALAYSIA",,1823-4690,,J ENG SCI TECHNOL,J.

Although there have been a large number of works done in the field of traffic data collection, there are several barriers which restrict the collection of traffic data at higher resolution in the cities. Installation and maintenance costs can act as a disincentive to use existing methods (e.g., loop detectors, video analysis) at a large scale and hence limit their deployment to only a few roads of the city. This paper presents an approach for vehicle counting using a low cost, simple and easily installable system. In the proposed system, vehicles (i.e., bicycles, cars, trucks) are counted by means of variations in the WiFi signals. Experiments with the developed hardware in two different scenarios-low traffic (i.e., 400 objects) and heavy traffic roads (i.e., 1000 objects)-demonstrate its ability to detect cars and trucks. The system can be used to provide estimates of vehicle numbers for streets not covered by official traffic monitoring techniques in future smart cities.","[Gupta, Shivam; Hamzin, Albert; Degbelo, Auriol] Westfalische Wilhelms Univ, Inst Geoinformat, D-48149 Munster, Germany",University of Munster,"Gupta, S (corresponding author), Westfalische Wilhelms Univ, Inst Geoinformat, D-48149 Munster, Germany.",shivam.gupta@uni-muenster.de; albert.hamzin@uni-muenster.de; degbelo@uni-muenster.de,"Gupta, Shivam/JNE-3789-2023; Gupta, Shivam/E-2555-2016; Degbelo, Auriol/H-6349-2019","Gupta, Shivam/0000-0002-1450-5435; Degbelo, Auriol/0000-0001-5087-8776; Hamzin, Albert/0000-0001-6096-4707",H2020-MSCA-ITN-2014 grant [642332],H2020-MSCA-ITN-2014 grant,This research was funded by H2020-MSCA-ITN-2014 grant number 642332.,,47,7,7,1,2,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,1424-8220,,SENSORS-BASEL,Sensors,NOV,2018,18,11,,,,,,,3623,10.3390/s18113623,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/s18113623,,,22,"Chemistry, Analytical; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Instruments & Instrumentation",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Chemistry; Engineering; Instruments & Instrumentation,HC1YJ,30366415.0,"Green Published, gold, Green Submitted",,,2024-08-15,WOS:000451598900033,,,,487

Simple and more elaborated ways of constructing a Pneumatron are shown, either using wires, a breadboard, or a printed circuit board.

This manual aims at helping users to avoid common mistakes, such as unstable measurements of the minimum and maximum amount of gas discharged from xylem tissue, which has major consequences for estimating embolism resistance. Major advantages of the Pneumatron device include its automated and accurate measurements of gas diffusion rates, including highly precise measurements of the gas volume in intact, embolised conduits.

Drifters have the potential of facilitating the monitoring and modeling of river behavior at a fraction of traditional monitoring costs.

During their travel, they collect and transmit information about their movement and their surrounding environment. In this paper, we present and assess a low-cost (<150 EUR) customizable drifter developed with off-the-shelf components. The open drifter is capable of handling the majority of use cases defined in the specialized literature and in addition it offers a general river flow characterization toolkit. One of the main goals of this work is to establish an open hardware and software basis to increase the use of drifters in river studies. Results show that the proposed drifter provides reliable surface velocity estimates when compared to a commercial flow meter, offering a lower cost per data point and in contrast to traditional point measurements it can be used to identify and classify large-scale surface flow patterns.

However, printed parts are typically plastic and often perform poorly compared to traditionally machined mechanisms. We have overcome many of the limitations of 3D printed mechanisms by exploiting the compliance of the plastic to produce a monolithic 3D printed flexure translation stage, capable of sub-micron-scale motion over a range of 8 x 8 x 4 mm. This requires minimal post-print clean-up and can be automated with readily available stepper motors. The resulting plastic composite structure is very stiff and exhibits remarkably low drift, moving less than 20 mu m over the course of a week, without temperature stabilisation. This enables us to construct a miniature microscope with excellent mechanical stability, perfect for time-lapse measurements in situ in an incubator or fume hood. The ease of manufacture lends itself to use in containment facilities where disposability is advantageous and to experiments requiring many microscopes in parallel. High performance mechanisms based on printed flexures need not be limited to microscopy, and we anticipate their use in other devices both within the laboratory and beyond.

This solution consists of an open hardware-software platform able to capture and process a wide range of frequencies. HackRF is the hardware component, while GNU Radio will provide the graphical support to this device. The tests performed with a set of 36 students have revealed that they are more satisfied with this framework than just employing a traditional equation-based environment as Matlab.

Extending visual Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) with other modalities such as an inertial measurement unit (IMU) can boost robustness and accuracy. However, for a tight sensor fusion, accurate time synchronization of the sensors is often crucial. Changing exposure times, internal sensor filtering, multiple clock sources and unpredictable delays from operation system scheduling and data transfer can make sensor synchronization challenging. In this paper, we present VersaVIS, an Open Versatile Multi-Camera Visual-Inertial Sensor Suite aimed to be an efficient research platform for easy deployment, integration and extension for many mobile robotic applications. VersaVIS provides a complete, open-source hardware, firmware and software bundle to perform time synchronization of multiple cameras with an IMU featuring exposure compensation, host clock translation and independent and stereo camera triggering. The sensor suite supports a wide range of cameras and IMUs to match the requirements of the application. The synchronization accuracy of the framework is evaluated on multiple experiments achieving timing accuracy of less than 1 ms. Furthermore, the applicability and versatility of the sensor suite is demonstrated in multiple applications including visual-inertial SLAM, multi-camera applications, multi-modal mapping, reconstruction and object based mapping.","[Tschopp, Florian; Riner, Michael; Fehr, Marius; Bernreiter, Lukas; Furrer, Fadri; Novkovic, Tonci; Cadena, Cesar; Siegwart, Roland; Nieto, Juan] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Autonomous Syst Lab, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland; [Fehr, Marius] Voliro Airborne Robot, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland; [Pfrunder, Andreas] Sevensense Robot, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland",Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich,"Tschopp, F (corresponding author), Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Autonomous Syst Lab, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland.",florian.tschopp@mavt.ethz.ch; michael.riner-kuhn@mavt.ethz.ch; marius.fehr@mavt.ethz.ch; lukas.bernreiter@mavt.ethz.ch; fadri.furrer@mavt.ethz.ch; tonci.novkovic@mavt.ethz.ch; andreas.pfrunder@sevensense.ch; cesarc@ethz.ch; rsiegwart@ethz.ch; nietoj@ethz.ch,"Furrer, Fadri/AAQ-3028-2020; Cadena, Cesar/AAM-4987-2020; Siegwart, Roland/A-4495-2008","Cadena, Cesar/0000-0002-2972-6011; Tschopp, Florian/0000-0001-7346-2941; Bernreiter, Lukas/0000-0002-3162-0363; Nieto, Juan/0000-0003-4808-0831; Novkovic, Tonci/0000-0003-0209-5915; Riner-Kuhn, Michael/0000-0001-7954-6468; Furrer, Fadri/0000-0002-6070-1760; Fehr, Marius/0000-0003-3276-4067; Siegwart, Roland/0000-0002-2760-7983","Siemens Mobility, Germany; National Center of Competence in Research (NCCR) Robotics through the Swiss National Science Foundation","Siemens Mobility, Germany; National Center of Competence in Research (NCCR) Robotics through the Swiss National Science Foundation(Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF))","This work was partly supported by Siemens Mobility, Germany and by the National Center of Competence in Research (NCCR) Robotics through the Swiss National Science Foundation.",,32,18,20,2,25,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,1424-8220,,SENSORS-BASEL,Sensors,MAR,2020,20,5,,,,,,,1439,10.3390/s20051439,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/s20051439,,,18,"Chemistry, Analytical; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Instruments & Instrumentation",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Chemistry; Engineering; Instruments & Instrumentation,LC4CE,32155749.0,"Green Published, Green Submitted, gold",,,2024-08-15,WOS:000525271500201,,,,493

Retrieval of animal-borne devices is often advantageous for several reasons, including data retrieval and animal welfare considerations; however, commercially available drop-off units are often prohibitively expensive and/or unreliable. Here, we present 'OpenDropOff', an open-source, low-cost electronic drop-off unit for remotely detaching animal-borne sensors from individuals. OpenDropOff devices function by using heat, produced by running an electrical current through resistance wire (nichrome), to melt nylon (e.g. fishing) line, detaching sensors from animals at or after a pre-determined time. OpenDropOff can be constructed using commercially available components (costing < USD $15 in total; approximately 10% or less of many commercially available drop-off units) and can be customized to fit project- and species-specific needs. Fourteen OpenDropOff devices have been field deployed on koalas (Phascolarctos cinereus) (n = 11), swamp wallaby (Wallabia bicolor) (n = 1), Australian brush turkey (Alectura lathami) (n = 1) and Australian white ibis (Threskiornis molucca) (n = 1), with the only detachment failure occurring after a device was damaged during the koala's unrelated death. OpenDropOff devices provide a wider range of researchers with a reliable, cost-effective tool for detaching animal-borne sensors. Their use could allow researchers to more efficiently allocate project resources, and their flexibility provides an opportunity to mitigate animal welfare concerns surrounding the use of animal-borne devices.","[Rafiq, Kasim] Liverpool John Moores Univ, Sch Nat Sci & Psychol, Liverpool, Merseyside, England; [Rafiq, Kasim; Jordan, Neil R.] Botswana Predator Conservat Trust, Maun, Botswana; [Appleby, Rob G.; Dexter, Cathryn E.; Jones, Darryl N.; Blacker, Amy R.

They are responsible for water and nutrient uptake and for interacting with biotic and abiotic factors in the soil. The root system architecture (RSA) and its plasticity are crucial for resource acquisition and consequently correlate with plant performance while being highly dependent on the surrounding environment, such as soil properties and therefore environmental conditions. Thus, especially for crop plants and regarding agricultural challenges, it is essential to perform molecular and phenotypic analyses of the root system under conditions as near as possible to nature (# asnearaspossibletonature). To prevent root illumination during experimental procedures, which would heavily affect root development, DarkRoot (D-Root) devices (DRDs) have been developed. In this article, we describe the construction and different applications of a sustainable, affordable, flexible, and easy to assemble open-hardware bench-top LEGO((R)) DRD, the DRD-BIBLOX (Brick Black Box). The DRD-BIBLOX consists of one or more 3D- printed rhizoboxes, which can be filled with soil while still providing root visibility. The rhizoboxes sit in a scaffold of secondhand LEGO((R)) bricks, which allows root development in the dark and non-invasive root tracking with an infrared (IR) camera and an IR light-emitting diode (LED) cluster. Proteomic analyses confirmed significant effects of root illumination on barley root and shoot proteomes. Additionally, we confirmed the significant effect of root illumination on barley root and shoot phenotypes. Our data therefore reinforces the importance of the application of field conditions in the lab and the value of our novel device, the DRD-BIBLOX. We further provide a DRD-BIBLOX application spectrum, spanning from investigating a variety of plant species and soil conditions and simulating different environmental conditions and stresses, to proteomic and phenotypic analyses, including early root tracking in the dark.","[Dermendjiev, Georgi; Schnurer, Madeleine; Thuer, Alexandra; Plott, Stefan; Ibl, Verena] Univ Vienna, Dept Funct & Evolutionary Ecol, Mol Syst Biol MoSys, Vienna, Austria; [Stewart, Ethan; Jez, Jakub] Vienna Bioctr Core Facil VBCF, Plant Sci Facil, Vienna, Austria; [Naegele, Thomas; Marino, Giada; Leister, Dario] Ludwig Maximilians Univ Munchen, Fac Biol, Plant Evolutionary Cell Biol, Planegg Martinsried, Germany",University of Vienna; University of Munich,"Ibl, V (corresponding author), Univ Vienna, Dept Funct & Evolutionary Ecol, Mol Syst Biol MoSys, Vienna, Austria.",verena.ibl@univie.ac.at,"Naegele, Thomas/JAZ-9854-2023; Marino, Giada/D-7527-2017","Naegele, Thomas/0000-0002-5896-238X; Marino, Giada/0000-0002-1525-4244; Plott, Stefan/0000-0002-9135-3519; Jez, Jakub/0000-0002-6481-4383",Austrian Science Fund FWF [33891]; FWF,Austrian Science Fund FWF(Austrian Science Fund (FWF)); FWF(Austrian Science Fund (FWF)),This research was funded by the Austrian Science Fund FWF P 33891 and FWF DOC111.,,61,0,0,3,11,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,LAUSANNE,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",1664-462X,,,FRONT PLANT SCI,Front.

These protocols are complex and need to be implemented correctly for correct operation of the system-on-chip. Therefore, protocol verification has received significant attention. However, this verification is often limited to checking high-level properties on a protocol specification or an implementation. Verifying these properties directly on an implementation faces scalability challenges due to its size and design complexity. Further, even after some high-level properties are verified, there is no guarantee that an implementation fully complies with a given specification, even if the same properties have also been checked on the specification. We address these challenges and gaps by adding a layer of component specifications, one for each component in the protocol implementation, and specifying and verifying the interactions at the interfaces between each pair of communicating components. We use the recently proposed formal model termed Instruction-Level Abstraction (ILA) as a component specification, which includes an interface specification for the interactions in composing different components. The use of ILA models as component specifications allows us to decompose the complete verification task into two sub-tasks: checking that the composition of ILAs is sequentially equivalent to a verified formal protocol specification, and checking that the protocol implementation is a refinement of the ILA composition. This check requires that each component implementation is a refinement of its ILA specification and includes interface checks guaranteeing that components interact with each other as specified. We have applied the proposed ILA-based methodology for protocol verification to several third-party design case studies. These include an AXI on-chip communication protocol, an off-chip communication protocol, and a cache coherence protocol. For each system, we successfully detected bugs in the implementation, and show that the full formal verification can be completed in reasonable time and effort.","[Lu, Huaixi; Xing, Yue; Gupta, Aarti; Malik, Sharad] Princeton Univ, 1 Nassau Hall, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA",Princeton University,"Lu, HX (corresponding author), Princeton Univ, 1 Nassau Hall, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA.",huaixil@princeton.edu; yuex@princeton.edu; aarti@cs.princeton.edu; sharad@princeton.edu,,"Malik, Sharad/0000-0002-0837-5443; Gupta, Aarti/0000-0001-6676-9400; Lu, Huaixi/0000-0002-3875-1761","Applications Driving Architectures (ADA) Research Center, a JUMP Center - SRC; DARPA; NSF [1628926]; DARPA POSH Program Project: Upscale: Scaling up formal tools for POSH Open Source Hardware","Applications Driving Architectures (ADA) Research Center, a JUMP Center - SRC; DARPA(United States Department of DefenseDefense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA)); NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)); DARPA POSH Program Project: Upscale: Scaling up formal tools for POSH Open Source Hardware(United States Department of Defense)","This work was supported by the Applications Driving Architectures (ADA) Research Center, a JUMP Center co-sponsored by SRC and DARPA.

The system is designed to use readily accessible vertically-mounted conduit and steel cables and be built with common hand tools so that it is easily replicable in remote areas and the developing world. It can be assembled and deployed in half an hour and easily dissembled and flat-packed for transport. The system can be fabricated for less than commercial racks and is completely customizable in terms of tilt angle and size. The racking system is designed to resist light to moderate wind loads consistent with everyday breezes rather than those commonly used for structural design which are based on extreme events; as it is assumed the racking system will be disassembled and stowed prior to an extreme wind event.

Whereas these robotic sailboats have good performance with open-source designs, it is actually hard for interested researchers or fans to follow and make their own sailboats with these open-source designs. Thus, in this paper, a generic and flexible unmanned sailboat platform with easy access to the hardware and software architectures is designed and tested. The commonly used 1-m class RC racing sailboat was employed to install Pixhawk V2.4.8, Arduino Mega 2,560, GPS module M8N, custom-designed wind direction sensor, and wireless 433 Mhz telegram. The widely used open-source hardware modules were selected to keep reliable and low-cost hardware setup to emphasize the generality and feasibility of the unmanned sailboat platform. In software architecture, the Pixhawk V2.4.8 provided reliable states' feedback. The Arduino Mega 2,560 received estimated states from Pixhawk V2.4.8 and the wind vane sensor, and then controlled servo actuators of rudder and sail using simplified algorithms. Due to the complexity of introducing robot operating system and its packages, we designed a generic but real-time software architecture just using Arduino Mega 2,560. A suitable line-of-sight guidance strategy and PID-based controllers were used to let the autonomous sailboat sail at user-defined waypoints. Field tests validated the sailing performance in facing WRSC challenges. Results of fleet race, station keeping, and area scanning proved that our design and algorithms could control the 1-m class RC sailboat with acceptable accuracy. The proposed design and algorithms contributed to developing educational, low-cost, micro class autonomous sailboats with accessible, generic, and flexible hardware and software. Besides, our sailboat platform also facilitates readers to develop similar sailboats with more focus on their missions.","[Yang, Shaolong; Liu, Chuan; Liu, Ya; An, Jinxin; Xiang, Xianbo] Huazhong Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Naval Architecture & Ocean Engn, Wuhan, Peoples R China; [Yang, Shaolong; Xiang, Xianbo] Huazhong Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Naval Architecture & Ocean Engn, Hubei Key Lab Naval Architecture & Ocean Engn Hyd, Wuhan, Peoples R China",Huazhong University of Science & Technology; Huazhong University of Science & Technology,"Xiang, XB (corresponding author), Huazhong Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Naval Architecture & Ocean Engn, Wuhan, Peoples R China.; Xiang, XB (corresponding author), Huazhong Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Naval Architecture & Ocean Engn, Hubei Key Lab Naval Architecture & Ocean Engn Hyd, Wuhan, Peoples R China.",xbxiang@hust.edu.cn,"Xiang, Xianbo/O-7613-2019","Xiang, Xianbo/0000-0002-6215-9864; Liu, Chuan/0000-0002-4048-1764","National Natural Science Foundation of China [52071153]; Industry-University Cooperative Education Project of Ministry of Education, China [201902044047]; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities, China [2018KFYYXJJ015]; School of Naval Architecture and Ocean Engineering, HUST; Experimental Technology Research Project - Lab and equipment administration department, HUST","National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Industry-University Cooperative Education Project of Ministry of Education, China; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities, China(Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities); School of Naval Architecture and Ocean Engineering, HUST; Experimental Technology Research Project - Lab and equipment administration department, HUST","This work is partially supported by National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant 52071153; Industry-University Cooperative Education Project of Ministry of Education, China under Grant 201902044047; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities, China under Grant 2018KFYYXJJ015; Teaching Research Project Funded by the School of Naval Architecture and Ocean Engineering, HUST; Experimental Technology Research Project Funded by the Lab and equipment administration department, HUST.",,23,2,2,2,32,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,LAUSANNE,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",2296-9144,,,FRONT ROBOT AI,Front.

From a technical point of view, the use of compound parabolic collectors (CPC) has been consolidated in the last decades. However, the relatively high cost of tooling conventional manufacturing processes for these collectors makes them difficult to afford in the most impoverished regions. This work presents the development of low-cost CPC and parabolic through solar collectors (PTC) by 3D printing of the structure and the use of recycled reflective materials. Besides, open-source hardware has been used to control system operation, including a supplementary UV LED system to compensate for the operation under low solar irradiance. Regarding the tested reflective materials, an optimum is obtained using an aluminium adhesive sheet that leads to an efficiency of 80% compared to a commercial CPC made of high-quality anodised aluminium, being the cost 20 times lower. On the other hand, incorporating a low-cost solar tracking system in a printed PTC reactor could lead to efficiencies up to 300% compared to the commercial CPC, while the cost was 4.5 times lower. Finally, the LED compensation system was successfully validated, allowing the operation with a constant treatment capacity during operation in cloudy conditions. In conclusion, the developed collectors are high-performance solar water treatment systems with a significantly lower investment cost, making them affordable worldwide. (c) 2021 The Authors.

Often computer screens, speakers and keyboards are sufficient. However, these devices are not appropriate for some situations. For example, some studies present tactile or olfactory stimuli or brain stimulation. Likewise, keyboard buttons are not appropriate for use with vocal responses, small animals or individuals with motor impairments. New method: We describe StimSync, which simulates USB keyboard inputs, allowing use with most experimental software. StimSync can measure button presses, optical signals from magnetic resonance imaging systems, changes in ambient light (e.g. synchronizing intracranial electrography), and auditory events (a voice key). In addition to the USB keyboard mode (necessarily millisecond precision), StimSync can also be set to provide higher precision timing. This feature can be used to validate timing, ensuring event synchronization (e.g. auditory events, visual events, brain stimulation). In addition to recording inputs, StimSync provides seven digital outputs for controlling external devices. Finally, StimSync can record analog inputs; we illustrate how this can be used to evaluate the rise time for computer displays. Results: We observed outputs with a mean latency of 2.1 ms (sd = 0.17 ms) and USB inputs with a mean latency of 2 ms (sd = 0.54 ms). Comparison with existing method(s): StimSync statistically outperforms two professional solutions and numerically outperforms other devices described in the literature. Conclusions: StimSync (http://www.mccauslandcenter.sc.edu/CRNL/tools/stimsync) provides an open-source solution for controlling and validating neuroscience experiments. In addition to sharing the design, we have produced a batch of devices to demonstrate the market for professional implementations.

In this work, we developed a ""do it yourself"" multichannel syringe pump by using easily available low-cost components and microcontrollers, which can be used for educational and/or research purposes in the study of microfluidics and flow chemistry. An Arduino UNO board with CNC shield expansion board and A4988 stepper motor driver is used to control the injection volume and rate of the four syringes. The Arduino-based open-source community minimizes the technical knowledge required to build the system and makes it readily shareable. Detailed fabrication guidelines are provided for the device, which is priced well below commercial alternatives and promotes the development of open hardware for microprocess engineering. The operation of the syringe pump can be controlled by the Arduino IDE or other software through the serial port, which is very beneficial for integration with other devices. Moreover, this multichannel syringe pump is also programmable and can be automatically operated. In order to verify the utility of the platform, we have carried out relevant demonstration experiments of microcapsule preparation for functioning cosmetic product and droplet generation based on microfluidic technique. From an educational point of view, students in the lab have the opportunity to learn how to design and build chemistry experimental devices from principles and demands in a hands-on learning environment, preparing them to work in modern and intelligent laboratories.","[Wu, Yuting; Chen, Yuxin; Cheng, Yi] Tsinghua Univ, Dept Chem Engn, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China",Tsinghua University,"Cheng, Y (corresponding author), Tsinghua Univ, Dept Chem Engn, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China.",yicheng@tsinghua.edu.cn,,"Chen, Yuxin/0000-0002-4622-8516; Wu, Yuting/0009-0006-2057-3510",National Natural Science Foundation of China [21991104]; National Natural Science Foundation of China; Tsinghua University Undergraduate Teaching Reform Project program,National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Tsinghua University Undergraduate Teaching Reform Project program,"This work is financially supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 21991104).

The high -resolution scaffolds produced by MEW have been primarily used for tissue engineering, cancer research, bio-fabrication and biomaterials. Unfortunately, the commercial MEW device's prohibitive affordability and lack of standardization of custom devices, represent obstacles to further research. Built on the achievements and affordability of material extrusion 3D printers, we convert an open-source Voron 0.1 printer into a highly capable MEW device, termed as MEWron. To guarantee availability, the use of commercial and affordable components is prioritized, while in the cases where this has not been possible, 3D printed, and easy-to-machine components have been employed. Two main approaches have been followed, the first one focused on the existing material extrusion configuration (i.e., filament-based feeding system and material input) while the second one focuses on a conventional MEW pneumatic feeding system and syringe reservoir. When not including the high voltage supply, both approaches have a final budget below $1000. The manuscript describes all required steps and components to modify a Voron 0.1 printer and provides the computer-aided design (CAD) for required custom components reproduction. Moreover, the MEWron devices' reliability is demonstrated, as well as their potential to extend the MEW field boundaries. We believe that the open-source MEWron device will facilitate unprece-dented MEW technology accessibility using a well-established and modifiable platform.","[Reizabal, Ander; Kangur, Taavet; Saiz, Paula G.; Menke, Sonke; Dalton, Paul D.; Luposchainsky, Simon] Univ Oregon, Phil & Penny Knight Campus Accelerating Sci Impact, 1505 Franklin Blvd, Eugene, OR 97403 USA; [Reizabal, Ander] BCMaterials, Basque Ctr Mat Applicat & Nanostruct, Bldg Martina Casiano, UPV-EHU Sci Pk, Barrio Sarri, Leioa 48940, Spain; [Kangur, Taavet; Moser, Christophe; Brugger, Juergen] Ecole Polytech Fed Lausanne, Lab Appl Photon Devices, CH-1015 Lausanne, Switzerland; [Saiz, Paula G.] Univ Basque Country UPV EHU, Fac Sci & Technol, Dept Phys Chem, Macromol Chem Res Grp LABQUIMAC, Bilbao, Spain",University of Oregon; BCMaterials; Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; Ecole Polytechnique Federale de Lausanne; University of Basque Country,"Dalton, PD; Luposchainsky, S (corresponding author), Univ Oregon, Phil & Penny Knight Campus Accelerating Sci Impact, 1505 Franklin Blvd, Eugene, OR 97403 USA.",pdalton@uoregon.edu; slupo@uoregon.edu,"Luposchainsky, Simon/HIK-3307-2022; Moser, Christophe/ABF-3174-2020; G.

In this context, the deployed robots are expected to fulfill land, underwater, and flying cooperative tasks which emulate real-world situations inspired by the 2011 Fukushima accident. Participation of the Tuscany Robotics Team at ERL Emergency Robots 2017 was deeply affected by damage to (and resulting unavailability of) the unmanned ground vehicle to be used in the competition. This damage occurred 3 days before the challenge. An entirely new working mobile platform was built from scratch using a low-cost chassis. It was able to compete with the other participants in the challenge and achieved various tasks (similar to 83% of the tasks completed by the best performer). The paper provides a complete description of the work carried out and the system used during the competition. The development was based on low-cost solutions, in particular: Adoption of open-hardware and open-software technology, providing cheap and fast-prototyping solutions. Use of smartphones, allowing sophisticated sensors to be exploited in an affordable way. Employment of Cloud infrastructures, to reduce the computational burden of offloading heavy processes. Results of this experience represent a concrete demonstration, showing that even low-cost solutions can achieve complex tasks, such as those required for the European robotic competition. The presented lessons learned aim to provide guidelines useful for reacting to unexpected events.

However, multi-color or hyperspectral SMLM can pose particular challenges which affect image quality and data interpretation, such as unequal photophysical performance of fluorophores and non-linear image registration issues, which arise as two emission channels travel along different optical paths to reach the detector. In addition, using evanescent-wave based approaches (Total Internal Reflection Fluorescence: TIRF) where beam shape, decay depth, and power density are important, different illumination wavelengths can lead to unequal imaging depth across multiple channels on the same sample. A potential useful approach would be to use a single excitation wavelength to perform hyperspectral localization imaging. We report herein on the use of a variable angle tunable thin-film filter to spectrally isolate far-red emitting fluorophores. This solution was integrated into a commercial microscope platform using an open-source hardware design, enabling the rapid acquisition of SMLM images arising from fluorescence emission captured within similar to 15 nm to 20 nm spectral windows (or detection bands). By characterizing intensity distributions, average intensities, and localization frequency through a range of spectral windows, we investigated several far-red emitting fluorophores and identified an optimal fluorophore pair for two-color SMLM using this method. Fluorophore crosstalk between the different spectral windows was assessed by examining the effect of varying the photon output thresholds on the localization frequency and fraction of data recovered. The utility of this approach was demonstrated by hyper-spectral super-resolution imaging of the interaction between the mitochondrial protein, TOM20, and the peroxisomal protein, PMP70.","[Vissa, Adriano; Kim, Peter K.; Yip, Christopher M.] Univ Toronto, Dept Biochem, Toronto, ON M5S 1A8, Canada; [Vissa, Adriano; Giuliani, Maximiliano; Yip, Christopher M.] Univ Toronto, Inst Biomat & Biomed Engn, Toronto, ON M5S 3G9, Canada; [Vissa, Adriano; Kim, Peter K.] Hosp Sick Children, Program Cell Biol, Toronto, ON M5G 0A4, Canada; [Yip, Christopher M.] Univ Toronto, Dept Chem Engn & Appl Chem, Toronto, ON M5S 1A4, Canada",University of Toronto; University of Toronto; University of Toronto; Hospital for Sick Children (SickKids); University of Toronto,"Yip, CM (corresponding author), Univ Toronto, Dept Biochem, Toronto, ON M5S 1A8, Canada.; Yip, CM (corresponding author), Univ Toronto, Inst Biomat & Biomed Engn, Toronto, ON M5S 3G9, Canada.; Yip, CM (corresponding author), Univ Toronto, Dept Chem Engn & Appl Chem, Toronto, ON M5S 1A4, Canada.",christopher.yip@utoronto.ca,,,Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada Discovery [RGPIN-2015-043],Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada Discovery(Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)),"This work was funded by the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada Discovery, Grant No. RGPIN-2015-043.",,28,2,3,1,12,AMER INST PHYSICS,MELVILLE,"1305 WALT WHITMAN RD, STE 300, MELVILLE, NY 11747-4501 USA",0034-6748,1089-7623,,REV SCI INSTRUM,Rev.

Although methods and protocols for tissue decellularization are abundant throughout the literature, they can be time intensive and typically require specific overhead in terms of equipment. To reduce these barriers to entry, a functional and reproducible prototype of a tissue infusion/perfusion device (TIPD) has been designed and fabricated using three-dimensional printed parts in conjunction with commercially available components. This TIPD forms a system composed of two peristaltic pumps, two 3-way valves, and a chamber in which tissue is contained, and is controlled by user-customizable software. To increase repeatability among decellularization protocols, an automation function has been integrated into the software, which is able to specify fluid flow rates and define specific valve locations enabling selection of solutions to be introduced into a scaffold over the course of a decellularization process. The prototype has been tested for proof of concept through infusion and perfusion decellularization of skeletal muscle and intact kidneys, respectively, and has shown successful removal of cellular content while maintaining an intact ultrastructure. In an effort to increase the reproducibility of experimental designs and to promote an open source hardware initiative in the field of tissue engineering, a novel device was conceptualized and prototyped with printable part files made available for its fabrication in tandem with instructions for assembly. Impact Statement Repeatable methods for decellularization are essential for achieving consistent substrates between batches, laboratories, and facilities. To meet this end, an automatable tissue infusion/perfusion device composed of three-dimensional printed parts and commercially available components has been prototyped and tested. Materials and instructions for its assembly have been made available in an effort to reduce variability among equipment as well as to provide a platform on which to iterate open-source hardware in tissue engineering.","[Schilling, Benjamin K.; Snowden, Malik J.; Baker, Jocelyn S.; Byrd, Kristen; Marra, Kacey G.] Univ Pittsburgh, Dept Bioengn, Pittsburgh, PA USA; [Lamberti, Kimberly K.; Komatsu, Chiaki; Solari, Mario G.; Marra, Kacey G.] Univ Pittsburgh, Dept Plast Surg, 203 Lothrop St Biomed Sci Tower E1655, Pittsburgh, PA 15213 USA; [Marra, Kacey G.] McGowan Inst Regenerat Med, Pittsburgh, PA USA",Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); University of Pittsburgh; Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); University of Pittsburgh,"Marra, KG (corresponding author), Univ Pittsburgh, Dept Plast Surg, 203 Lothrop St Biomed Sci Tower E1655, Pittsburgh, PA 15213 USA.",marrak@upmc.edu,,"Baker, Jocelyn/0000-0001-7858-0752; Lamberti, Kimberly/0000-0001-7182-3440",,,,,40,10,11,1,9,"MARY ANN LIEBERT, INC",NEW ROCHELLE,"140 HUGUENOT STREET, 3RD FL, NEW ROCHELLE, NY 10801 USA",1937-3341,1937-335X,,TISSUE ENG PT A,Tissue Eng.

The posit number system composed of a run-time varying exponent component, which is defined by a composition of varying length ""regime-bit"" and ""exponent-bit"" (with a maximum size of ES bits, the exponent size). This in effect also makes the fraction part to vary at run-time in size and position. These run-time variations inherit an interesting hardware design challenge for posit arithmetic architectures. The posit number system, being at an infant stage of its development, possess very limited hardware solutions for its arithmetic architectures. In this view, this paper targets the algorithmic development and generic HDL generators (PACoGen) for basic posit arithmetic. The proposed open source PACoGen currently includes the adder/subtractor, multiplier, and division arithmetic. The PACoGen can provide the Verilog HDL code respective posit arithmetic for any given posit word width (N) and exponent size (ES), as defined under the posit number system. Further, pipelined architectures of 32-bit posit with 6-bit exponent size are also proposed and discussed for addition/subtraction, multiplication, and division arithmetic. The proposed posit arithmetic architectures are demonstrated on the Virtex-7 (xc7vx330t-3ffg1157) FPGA device as well as Nangate 15 nm ASIC platform.

It can be deployed as a testbed for depth controllers, as well as a mobile sensor platform for research or in industrial tanks. We introduce a control law that is based on the feedback linearization method and enhanced by an adaptive fuzzy algorithm to cope with modeling inaccuracies. The proposed depth controller is computationally light enough to run on ADAs embedded hardware. In experiments performed in a wave tank, the adaptive fuzzy scheme shows the ability to deal with both depth regulation and depth profile tracking. ADA is even able to hold on to dynamic isobars despite external disturbances.

Aquatic environmental DNA (eDNA) has emerged as a promising approach to identify organisms in freshwater and marine environments. While the recovery of eDNA from water most commonly involves capture of biological debris on a filter matrix, practitioners are yet to converge on standardized approaches for filtration, particularly in the field. This lack of standardization has resulted in inconsistent handling of samples following collection, limiting interpretation of results across studies and burdening groups with inconvenient storage and transport logistics that may compromise eDNA integrity.Methods. A simple to assemble and low-cost ($350 USD) water filtration system is demonstrated that can be used in field and laboratory settings to reduce time between sample acquisition and eDNA filtration, maximizing eDNA sample recovery. Quantitative PCR is used to show the utility of the platform for laboratory and marine eDNA analysis.Results. The resulting eDNA collection system is easily transported in a rugged water-resistant case, operates for more than eight hours on a 12-volt lead-acid battery, and has an unobstructed filtration rate of 150.05 & PLUSMN; 7.01 mL/min and 151.70 & PLUSMN; 6.72 mL/min with 0.22 & mu;m and 0.45 & mu;m Sterivex filters, respectively. We show that immediate sample filtration increases eDNA recovery in the laboratory, and demonstrate collections in aquaria and marine environments. We anticipate that providing easy to obtain, open hardware designs for eDNA sample collection will increase standardization of aquatic eDNA collection methods and improve cross-study comparisons.","[DeHart, Hayley M.] Johns Hopkins Univ, Res & Exploratory Dev Dept, Laurel, MD USA; [Gasser, Mark T.; Thielen, Peter] Johns Hopkins Univ, Res & Exploratory Dev Dept, Appl Phys Lab, Laurel, MD 20723 USA; [Dixon, Jarret] Johns Hopkins Univ, Force Project Sect, Appl Phys Lab, Laurel, MD USA",Johns Hopkins University; Johns Hopkins University; Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory; Johns Hopkins University; Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory,"Thielen, P (corresponding author), Johns Hopkins Univ, Res & Exploratory Dev Dept, Appl Phys Lab, Laurel, MD 20723 USA.",ter.thielen@jhuapl.edu,"Gasser, Mark T/KLC-5289-2024","Gasser, Mark T/0000-0002-9396-4954",JHU/APL Internal Research and Development; Department of Navy [N00014-21-1-2610],JHU/APL Internal Research and Development; Department of Navy,"This study was funded by JHU/APL Internal Research and Development and the Department of Navy award N00014-21-1-2610 issued by the Office of Naval Research.

MKIDs feature intrinsic frequency domain multiplexing (FDM) at microwave frequencies, allowing the construction and readout of large arrays. Due to the microwave FDM, MKIDs do not require the complex cryogenic multiplexing electronics used for similar detectors, such as transition edge sensors, but instead transfer this complexity to room temperature electronics where they present a formidable signal processing challenge. In this paper, we describe the first successful effort to build a readout for a photon counting optical/near-IR astronomical instrument, the ARray Camera for Optical to Near-infrared Spectrophotometry.

It is designed, built, and tested for its ability to convert post-consumer waste, 3D printed products and waste into polymer feedstock for recyclebots of fused particle/granule printers. The technical specifications of the device are quantified in terms of power consumption (380 to 404 W for PET and PLA, respectively) and particle size distribution. The open source device can be fabricated for less than $2000 USD in materials. The experimentally measured power use is only a minor contribution to the overall embodied energy of distributed recycling of waste plastic. The resultant plastic particle size distributions were found to be appropriate for use in both recyclebots and direct material extrusion 3D printers. Simple retrofits are shown to reduce sound levels during operation by 4dB-5dB for the vacuum. These results indicate that the open source waste plastic granulator is an appropriate technology for community, library, maker space, fab lab, or small business-based distributed recycling.","[Ravindran, Arvind; Scsavnicki, Sean; Nelson, Walker; Gorecki, Peter; Franz, Jacob; Barnard, Andrew R.] Michigan Technol Univ, Dept Mech Engn Engn Mech, Houghton, MI 49931 USA; [Oberloier, Shane; Pearce, Joshua M.] Michigan Technol Univ, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, Houghton, MI 49931 USA; [Meyer, Theresa K.; Pearce, Joshua M.] Michigan Technol Univ, Dept Mat Sci & Engn, Houghton, MI 49931 USA; [Pearce, Joshua M.] Aalto Univ, Sch Elect Engn, Dept Elect & Nanoengn, FI-00076 Espoo, Finland",Michigan Technological University; Michigan Technological University; Michigan Technological University; Aalto University,"Pearce, JM (corresponding author), Michigan Technol Univ, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, Houghton, MI 49931 USA.; Pearce, JM (corresponding author), Michigan Technol Univ, Dept Mat Sci & Engn, Houghton, MI 49931 USA.; Pearce, JM (corresponding author), Aalto Univ, Sch Elect Engn, Dept Elect & Nanoengn, FI-00076 Espoo, Finland.",arvindr@mtu.edu; ssscsavn@mtu.edu; wnelson@mtu.edu; pjgoreck@mtu.edu; jafranz@mtu.edu; swoberlo@mtu.edu; tkmeyer@mtu.edu; arbarnar@mtu.edu; pearce@mtu.edu,"Meyer, Theresa/IUM-2713-2023; Pearce, Joshua/C-9240-2013","Oberloier, Shane/0000-0002-2727-9713; Barnard, Andrew/0000-0003-3276-8113; Pearce, Joshua/0000-0001-9802-3056",Witte Endowment,Witte Endowment,This research was funded by the Witte Endowment.,,70,11,11,2,18,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2227-7080,,TECHNOLOGIES,Technologies,DEC,2019,7,4,,,,,,,74,10.3390/technologies7040074,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/technologies7040074,,,21,"Engineering, Multidisciplinary",Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI),Engineering,KB7HV,,gold,,,2024-08-15,WOS:000506662500007,,,,516

This new architecture consists of human-computer interaction (HCI) client, a cloud server, and an edge controller. It is designed based on open-source hardware and software, with the advantages of low cost, high flexibility, and easy replication. It can offer a reference design for better and further research of CCSs. Then, a cloud-based maglev control system (CMCS) is developed, and a case study on tracking control with disturbance is performed. Furthermore, a dual-structural controller based on equivalent-input-disturbance (EID) and networked predictive control (NPC) approach is devised to enhance the disturbance rejection performance for CCSs with communication constraints. The system is divided into two subsystems, and the separation theorem is applied to simplify the design. A discrete-time EID (DEID) estimator is introduced for one subsystem to compensate for the time delay and the exogenous disturbance. For another subsystem, a time-event-driven strategy-based NPC method is devised to increase the dynamical performance of handling packet loss. Finally, experimental results verified the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed framework and the DEID-based dual-structural control algorithm.","[Huang, Guangpu; Wu, Xiang; Guo, Fanghong; Dong, Hui; Yu, Li] Zhejiang Univ Technol, Coll Informat Engn, Hangzhou 310023, Zhejiang, Peoples R China; [She, Jinhua] Tokyo Univ Technol, Sch Engn, Tokyo 1920982, Japan",Zhejiang University of Technology; Tokyo University of Technology,"Wu, X (corresponding author), Zhejiang Univ Technol, Coll Informat Engn, Hangzhou 310023, Zhejiang, Peoples R China.",gphuang@zjut.edu.cn; xiangwu@zjut.edu.cn; fhguo@zjut.edu.cn; hdong@zjut.edu.cn; lyu@zjut.edu.cn; she@stf.teu.ac.jp,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of China [62203391]; Natural Science Foundation of Zhejiang Province [LQ22F030015, LDT23E05014F03]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Natural Science Foundation of Zhejiang Province(Natural Science Foundation of Zhejiang Province),"This work was supported in part by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant No. 62203391, and in part by the Natural Science Foundation of Zhejiang Province under Grant No. LQ22F030015 and LDT23E05014F03.",,30,0,0,4,8,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",0016-0032,1879-2693,,J FRANKLIN I,J.

This strategy centrally involves the downstream firms distributing design costs over multiple down-stream firms-a strategy that is routine to producers selling to multiple down-stream firms but which has been in the past typically not practical for coalitions of downstream firms. Today, downstream firms find it increasingly feasible to codesign products they may all purchase because of two technological trends. First, computer-aided design/computer-aided manufacturing and other design technologies are lowering downstream firms' costs to develop designs for purchased hardware inputs. Second, better communication technologies are lowering the costs of doing such projects collaboratively, even among large groups of downstream customer firms. Downstream firms collaborating to develop a design for a hardware input they can all purchase could in principle choose to protect their design as a club good. However, opening up collaboratively created designs to free riders can increase the profits of the contributing firms for several reasons we explore and model. Important among these is that free revealing draws free riders away from purchases of proprietary software or hardware to customer-developed free substitutes. This ""scale-stealing"" mechanism reduces the markets of up-stream suppliers of competing proprietary inputs. In the case of hardware only, free riders also contribute to reducing the average manufacturing costs of the open hardware by increasing purchase volumes and so creating increased economies of scale. Resulting reduced unit purchase costs benefit downstream firms contributing to the free design as well as free riders.","[Gambardella, Alfonso] Bocconi Univ, Dept Management & Technol, Invernizzi Ctr Res Innovat Org Strategy & Entrepr, I-20136 Milan, Italy; [Gambardella, Alfonso] Ctr Econ Policy Res, London EC1V 0DX, England; [Von Hippel, Eric] MIT, MIT Sloan Sch Management, Cambridge, MA 02142 USA",Bocconi University; Centre for Economic Policy Research - UK; Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT),"Gambardella, A (corresponding author), Bocconi Univ, Dept Management & Technol, Invernizzi Ctr Res Innovat Org Strategy & Entrepr, I-20136 Milan, Italy.; Gambardella, A (corresponding author), Ctr Econ Policy Res, London EC1V 0DX, England.",alfonso.gambardella@unibocconi.it; evhippel@mit.edu,"; Gambardella, Alfonso/K-2641-2012","von Hippel, Eric/0000-0002-7235-1032; Gambardella, Alfonso/0000-0002-8714-5813",,,,,49,7,10,1,14,INFORMS,CATONSVILLE,"5521 RESEARCH PARK DR, SUITE 200, CATONSVILLE, MD 21228 USA",2333-2050,2333-2077,,STRATEG SCI,Strateg.

To this end, two types of communications were used: the first is a low-cost communication based on the ZigBee protocol used for control purposes, so that it can be customized according to specific needs, while the second is based on a Bluetooth protocol used for data display.","[Salamone, Francesco; Belussi, Lorenzo; Danza, Ludovico; Ghellere, Matteo; Meroni, Italo] Natl Res Council Italy ITC CNR, Construct Technol Inst, I-20098 San Giuliano Milanese, MI, Italy",Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche (CNR); Istituto per le Tecnologie della Costruzione (ITC-CNR),"Salamone, F (corresponding author), Natl Res Council Italy ITC CNR, Construct Technol Inst, Via Lombardia 49, I-20098 San Giuliano Milanese, MI, Italy.",salamone@itc.cnr.it; belussi@itc.cnr.it; danza@itc.cnr.it; ghellere@itc.cnr.it; meroni@itc.cnr.it,"Danza, Ludovico/AAW-3770-2020; Danza, Ludovico/B-6954-2015; Belussi, Lorenzo/C-7504-2017; Salamone, Francesco/O-4213-2015","Danza, Ludovico/0000-0003-3305-4008; Danza, Ludovico/0000-0003-3305-4008; Belussi, Lorenzo/0000-0002-1341-0602; Salamone, Francesco/0000-0003-3215-3979; Ghellere, Matteo/0000-0001-8448-3705",National Research Council of Italy (CNR); Lombardy Region in the framework of the research project INTEGRATE (INnovazioni TEcnologiche per una Gestione RAzionale del Tessuto Edilizio),National Research Council of Italy (CNR)(Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche (CNR)); Lombardy Region in the framework of the research project INTEGRATE (INnovazioni TEcnologiche per una Gestione RAzionale del Tessuto Edilizio),This work has been supported within the Framework Agreement between the National Research Council of Italy (CNR) and the Lombardy Region in the framework of the research project INTEGRATE (INnovazioni TEcnologiche per una Gestione RAzionale del Tessuto Edilizio).,,19,19,19,0,30,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,1424-8220,,SENSORS-BASEL,Sensors,NOV,2015,15,11,,,,,27990,28004,,10.3390/s151127990,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/s151127990,,,15,"Chemistry, Analytical; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Instruments & Instrumentation",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Chemistry; Engineering; Instruments & Instrumentation,CX4QW,26556356.0,"Green Submitted, gold, Green Published",,,2024-08-15,WOS:000365686400028,,,,521

The battery system is the most expensive part in the majority of the e-mobility devices. Therefore, battery manufacturers tend to reduce the battery cost by using simple battery management systems that provide only basic safety features. Possible advanced functionalities are not implemented and the battery may lose performanceduring its use. Widely spread maintenance centers are thus required to support the mobility electrification process, but their diffusion is limited by the high cost ofprofessional battery characterization instruments. This work proposes an open-hardware low-cost battery maintenance tool architecture that can be used with common laboratory instruments. The tool is based on a relay-matrix and a battery monitor integrated circuit. It is able to completely characterize and optimize the state of a battery independently of the battery management system and also gives a figure of the individual aging of the battery cells. The work shows the architecture and the experimental validation of a 16-cells battery maintenance tool prototype. The results demonstrate that utilizing the tool brings the battery in the best possible state and identifies the degradation of the cells in terms of capacity and resistance.","[Carloni, Andrea; Baronti, Federico; Di Rienzo, Roberto; Roncella, Roberto; Saletti, Roberto] Univ Pisa, Dipartimento Ingn Informaz, Via Caruso 16, I-56122 Pisa, Italy",University of Pisa,"Saletti, R (corresponding author), Univ Pisa, Dipartimento Ingn Informaz, Via Caruso 16, I-56122 Pisa, Italy.",andrea.carloni@ing.unipi.it; federico.baronti@unipi.it; roberto.dirienzo@unipi.it; roberto.roncella@unipi.it; roberto.saletti@unipi.it,,"Saletti, Roberto/0000-0001-9594-3535; Roncella, Roberto/0000-0003-4087-9761; DI RIENZO, ROBERTO/0000-0002-4238-5864; Carloni, Andrea/0000-0003-0554-5299","PAR FAS Toscana 2007-2013 (Bando FAR FAS 2014) [4421.02102014.072000022]; ENEA ""Ricerca di Sistema Elettrico-Electrochemical Storage Systems and relevant network interfaces""; CrossLab project by MIUR ""Departments of Excellence"" program","PAR FAS Toscana 2007-2013 (Bando FAR FAS 2014); ENEA ""Ricerca di Sistema Elettrico-Electrochemical Storage Systems and relevant network interfaces""; CrossLab project by MIUR ""Departments of Excellence"" program","This research was partially funded by PAR FAS Toscana 2007-2013 (Bando FAR FAS 2014), under agreement n. 4421.02102014.072000022 Project SUMA, by ENEA ""Ricerca di Sistema Elettrico-Electrochemical Storage Systems and relevant network interfaces"", and supported by the CrossLab project funded by MIUR ""Departments of Excellence"" program.",,27,6,6,7,13,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,1996-1073,,ENERGIES,Energies,AUG,2021,14,16,,,,,,,4962,10.3390/en14164962,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/en14164962,,,10,Energy & Fuels,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Energy & Fuels,UG5JQ,,gold,,,2024-08-15,WOS:000689288900001,,,,522

Therefore, it benefits from the following advantages, such as simple structure, low cost, convenient deployment, and robust scalability. In order to verify the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed NRCP, a networked magnetic levitation control system (NMLCS) is developed on the basis of this NRCP system. Furthermore, a discrete-time equivalent-input-disturbance (DEID)-based model predictive control approach is proposed for NMLCS to deal with the common practical issues in NCSs, such as time delay and disturbance. Specifically, the time delay is modeled as delay-induced disturbance (DID), whose influence is effectively estimated and eliminated by the designed controller. Several experimental case studies are performed to verify the effectiveness of the NRCP, the DEID-based control algorithm, and the analytical method of DID.","[Huang, Guangpu; Wu, Xiang; Guo, Fanghong; Yu, Li; Zhang, Wen-An] Zhejiang Univ Technol, Coll Informat Engn, Hangzhou 310023, Peoples R China; [Huang, Guangpu; Wu, Xiang; Guo, Fanghong; Yu, Li; Zhang, Wen-An] Zhejiang Prov United Key Lab Embedded Syst, Hangzhou 310023, Peoples R China",Zhejiang University of Technology,"Wu, X (corresponding author), Zhejiang Univ Technol, Coll Informat Engn, Hangzhou 310023, Peoples R China.",1111703014@zjut.edu.cn; xiangwu@zjut.edu.cn; fhguo@zjut.edu.cn; lyu@zjut.edu.cn; wazhang@zjut.edu.cn,"wang, xin/JWA-3772-2024; wang, shuo/KCL-3379-2024; Wu, Xiang/ABD-2222-2022","Yu, Li/0000-0003-3889-3863; Zhang, Wen-An/0000-0002-4355-2783","Natural Science Foundation of Zhejiang Province [LQ22F030015, LD21F030002]; NSFC-Zhejiang Joint Foundation for the Integration of Industrialization and Informatization [U1709213]; Key Research and Development Program of Zhejiang Province [2020C01109]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [61903333]",Natural Science Foundation of Zhejiang Province(Natural Science Foundation of Zhejiang Province); NSFC-Zhejiang Joint Foundation for the Integration of Industrialization and Informatization; Key Research and Development Program of Zhejiang Province; National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),"This work was supported in part by the Natural Science Foundation of Zhejiang Province under Grant LQ22F030015 and Grant LD21F030002, in part by the NSFC-Zhejiang Joint Foundation for the Integration of Industrialization and Informatization under Grant U1709213, in part by the Key Research and Development Program of Zhejiang Province under Grant 2020C01109, and in part by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant 61903333.",,35,7,7,7,55,IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC,PISCATAWAY,"445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA",0278-0046,1557-9948,,IEEE T IND ELECTRON,IEEE Trans.

Spraying during stable atmospheric conditions should be avoided to prevent surface-temperature inversion-induced off-target drift of crop protection materials. Previous statistical analysis determined times of high likelihood of stable atmospheric conditions, which are unfavorable for spraying, during the day under clear and cloudy conditions in hot summer months in the Mississippi Delta. Results validated the thresholds of temperature increase in the morning and temperature drop in the afternoon with wind speeds and the transition between stable and unstable atmospheric conditions. With this information, an algorithm was developed to calculate if atmospheric conditions were favorable for spraying based on field temperature and wind speed at any instant. With this algorithm, a web application was built to provide real-time determination of atmospheric stability and hourly online recommendation of whether aerial applications were appropriate for a location and time in the Mississippi Delta. This study further developed another web application specifically for Stoneville, Mississippi, with data measured from weather stations constructed from inexpensive open-source electronics, accessories, and software for more accurate online guidance for site-specific drift management. The web application is adapted for accessing on mobile terminals, such as smartphones and tablets, and provides timely guidance for aerial applicators and producers to avoid spray drift and air quality issues long distances downwind in the area.","[Huang, Y.; Fisher, D.

In the presented work, we have proposed a simple system for microscopy utilising open-source platform Arduino. Testing this system showed that it had sufficient sensitivity to determine the physical processes occurring in a cryopreserved sample such as intra- and extracellular water crystallisation and salt eutectic. Utilising this system, we investigated the mechanisms of cryoprotection and cryodamage of testis interstitial cells (ICs) in cryoprotective media, which included cryoprotective agents such as dimethyl sulphoxide (Me2SO), as well as foetal bovine serum or polymers (dextran, hydroxyethyl starch and polyethylene glycol). It was shown that a serum-/xeno-free medium that included 0.7 M Me2SO and 100 mg/mL dextran was able to reduce intracellular water crystallisation in cells, change the structure of extracellular ice, and reduce salt eutectic and recrystallisation. All these effects correlated with better IC survival after cryopreservation in the medium. This medium is potentially less toxic as it has lower concentrations of Me2SO compared to serum-containing media developed for cryopreservation of testicular cells. This would pave a way for the creation of nontoxic serum-free compositions that does not require removal before use of cryopreserved living cells for laboratory practice or in clinics. Research in the field of cryobiology involves many technics linked with the assessment of cell recovery after cooling/warming as well as quantification, identification and description of physical processes occurring in and out of the cells. These processes can affect the overall outcome of cryopreservation. Thus, the investigation of the mechanisms of cryoprotection and cryodamage is of high importance. In this work, we have developed a system for cryomicroscopy utilising open-source platform for prototyping electronic devices and systems Arduino. The platform includes hardware and software designed to develop various projects. It also supports a programming language. The language was used to create a code to control cooling rate of the sample undergoing microscopy. The system was able to visualise the structure of the forming ice crystals, recrystallisation, salt eutectic crystallisation/melting and intracellular phase transitions. It can be utilised in combination with other approaches and techniques. The system helped us to solve specific tasks of cryobiological experimentation connected with the establishment of mechanisms of cryoprotection and cryodamage of testis interstitial cells (ICs). The microscopy data allowed us to compare different media developed for cryopreservation of testicular cells. The serum-containing cryoprotective medium (1.4 M Me2SO and 10% foetal bowine serum) was able to suppress darkening of cell, known as 'flashing' associated with intracellular phase transitions by moderately dehydrating cells, and salt eutectic transitions during cooling/warming. However, the media contains relatively high Me2SO concentration and may be toxic. Additionally, the use of serum in the media can result in transferring infection when cryopreserved cells are used in medicine or veterinary, or lead to instability of the composition of serum-containing media from batch to batch. In the course of the research, we have shown that using the serum-/xeno-free medium supplemented with 0.7 M Me2SO and 100 mg/mL Dex (0.7 Me2SO+Dex) can also reduce cell 'flashing'. The medium influenced the size and shape of extracellular ice crystals in a way that can potentially reduce the risk of mechanical cell damage. This medium promoted amorphous solidification in the space between the extracellular ice crystals, thus, lowering the salt eutectic transitions and recrystallisation that could otherwise cause additional cell damage. Therefore, application of the developed system for cryomicroscopy, which allowed real-time visualisation of cryobiological processes, made it possible to draw a conclusion about cryoprotecitive properties of medium for ICs. 0.7 Me2SO+Dex can be the basis for the creation of commercial serum-free media with a defined composition that does not require removal before use.","[Pakhomov, Oleksandr; Shevchenko, Nadiia; Chernobai, Nadiia; Prokopiuk, Volodymyr; Yershov, Serhii; Bozhok, Galyna] Natl Acad Sci Ukraine, Inst Problems Cryobiol & Cryomed, Dept Cryoendocrinol, Kharkiv, Ukraine; [Pakhomov, Oleksandr] Natl Acad Sci Ukraine, Inst Problems Cryobiol & Cryomed, Dept Cryoendocrinol, 23 Pereyaslavskaya St, UA-61016 Kharkiv, Ukraine",National Academy of Sciences Ukraine; Institute for Problems of Cryobiology & Cryomedicine of NASU; National Academy of Sciences Ukraine; Institute for Problems of Cryobiology & Cryomedicine of NASU,"Pakhomov, O (corresponding author), Natl Acad Sci Ukraine, Inst Problems Cryobiol & Cryomed, Dept Cryoendocrinol, 23 Pereyaslavskaya St, UA-61016 Kharkiv, Ukraine.",aleksandr.pakhomov2017@gmail.com,"Shevchenko, Nadiia/AAE-3992-2022","Shevchenko, Nadiia/0000-0001-6794-1444; Pakhomov, Oleksandr/0000-0002-7494-654X",,,,,58,0,0,1,2,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-2720,1365-2818,,J MICROSC-OXFORD,J.

One popular approach is to measure the movements of restrained animals while presenting controlled sensory stimulation. This approach is especially powerful when applied to genetic model organisms, such as Drosophila melanogaster, where modern genetic tools enable unprecedented access to the nervous system for activity monitoring or targeted manipulation. While there is a long history of measuring the behavior of body- and head-fixed insects walking on an air-supported ball, the methods typically require complex setups with many custom components. Here we present a compact, simplified setup for these experiments that achieves high-performance at low cost. The simplified setup integrates existing hardware and software solutions with new component designs. We replaced expensive optomechanical and custom machined components with off-the-shelf and 3D-printed parts, and built the system around a low-cost camera that achieves 180 Hz imaging and an inexpensive tablet computer to present view-angle-corrected stimuli updated through a local network. We quantify the performance of the integrated system and characterize the visually guided behavior of flies in response to a range of visual stimuli. In this paper, we thoroughly document the improved system; the accompanying repository incorporates CAD files, parts lists, source code, and detailed instructions. We detail a complete ~$300 system, including a cold-anesthesia tethering stage, that is ideal for hands-on teaching laboratories. This represents a nearly 50-fold cost reduction as compared to a typical system used in research laboratories, yet is fully featured and yields excellent performance. We report the current state of this system, which started with a 1-day teaching lab for which we built seven parallel setups and continues toward a setup in our lab for larger-scale analysis of visual-motor behavior in flies. Because of the simplicity, compactness, and low cost of this system, we believe that high-performance measurements of tethered insect behavior should now be widely accessible and suitable for integration into many systems. This access enables broad opportunities for comparative work across labs, species, and behavioral paradigms.","[Loesche, Frank; Reiser, Michael B.] Howard Hughes Med Inst, Janelia Res Campus, Ashburn, VA 20147 USA",Howard Hughes Medical Institute,"Reiser, MB (corresponding author), Howard Hughes Med Inst, Janelia Res Campus, Ashburn, VA 20147 USA.",reiserm@janelia.hhmi.org,,"Loesche, Frank/0000-0002-7780-6438",HHMI,HHMI(Howard Hughes Medical Institute),This project was supported by HHMI.,,35,4,4,0,7,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,LAUSANNE,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",1662-5153,,,FRONT BEHAV NEUROSCI,Front.

It is based upon a single-degree-of-freedom potentiometer fader coupled to a DC motor, also known as a ""motorized fader."" A light is connected in parallel with the motor to help communicate the force's strength visually. The FireFader consists of only open-source hardware and open-source software elements. Consequently, it is relatively easy for users to repurpose it into new projects involving varying kinds and numbers of motors and sensors. An open-source device driver for the FireFader allows it to be linked to a computer via USB so that the computer can perform the feedback control calculations. For example, the computer can simulate the acoustics of a virtual musical instrument to concurrently synthesize sound and calculate the motor force as a function of the fader position. The serial connection over USB increases the latency of the control signal compared to embedded implementations, but the serial connection facilitates easier programming via the computer, and the force feedback can be automatically disabled when the user is not touching the fader. Some new devices derived from the FireFader design are presented.","[Berdahl, Edgar] Tech Univ Berlin, Sekretariat EN 8, Audio Commun Grp, D-10587 Berlin, Germany; [Kontogeorgakopoulos, Alexandros] Cardiff Metropolitan Univ, Cardiff Sch Art & Design, Cardiff CF5 2YB, S Glam, Wales",Technical University of Berlin; Cardiff Metropolitan University,"Berdahl, E (corresponding author), Tech Univ Berlin, Sekretariat EN 8, Audio Commun Grp, Einsteinufer 17C, D-10587 Berlin, Germany.",eberdahl@mail.tu-berlin.de; akontogeorgakopoulos@cardiffmet.ac.uk,,,Alexander von Humboldt Foundation,Alexander von Humboldt Foundation(Alexander von Humboldt Foundation),"The authors would like to thank the Alexander von Humboldt Foundation for supporting this work and would like to acknowledge the researchers who have influenced, motivated, and enabled this work, including Bill Verplank, Claude Cadoz, Stefan Weinzierl, Jean-Loup Florens, Annie Luciani, and Chris Chafe.",,36,15,21,0,3,MIT PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"ONE ROGERS ST, CAMBRIDGE, MA 02142-1209 USA",0148-9267,1531-5169,,COMPUT MUSIC J,Comput.

Fault rates increase in turn and become more concerning, particularly at the scale of High-Performance Computing (HPC) systems: on one hand, hardware fault protection is costly - more than 10% silicon area for floating-point units; on the other, HPC users expect correct application output after the anticipated time of computation, but workloads are seldom bit-reproducible and tolerances in output are allowed for. Benign hardware faults causing errors within these tolerances are therefore acceptable: however, with abstract reliability targets such as 'undetected failures per time,' current HPC system design does not allow for pursuing trade-offs between reliability and performance with respect to faults. To address the above, we propose a user-centric reliability benchmark to specify HPC system reliability targets, allowing for better performance optimizations in hardware design, while meeting HPC user expectations. Our open-source Hardware Design Fault Injection Toolkit (HDFIT) enables - for the first time - end-to-end hardware design reliability experiments: from netlist-level fault injection to application output error. In a proof of concept we present an HPC general matrix multiply (GEMM) reliability study, targeting a series of popular applications, and using HDFIT to benchmark an open-source GEMM accelerator.","[Omland, Patrik; Netti, Alessio; Peng, Yang; Baldovin, Andrea; Paulitsch, Michael; Espinosa, Gustavo; Parra, Jorge] Intel Corp, Santa Clara, CA 95054 USA; [Omland, Patrik; Hinz, Gereon; Knoll, Alois] Tech Univ Munich, Dept Informat, D-80333 Munich, Germany",Intel Corporation; Technical University of Munich,"Omland, P (corresponding author), Intel Corp, Santa Clara, CA 95054 USA.",patrik.omland@gmail.com; alessio.netti@intel.com; yang.r.peng@intel.com; andrea.baldovin@intel.com; michael.paulitsch@intel.com; gustavo.p.espinosa@intel.com; jorge.e.parra@intel.com; gereon.hinz@tum.de; knoll@in.tum.de,"Knoll, Alois/AAN-8417-2021","Knoll, Alois/0000-0003-4840-076X; Parra Osorio, Jorge Eduardo/0000-0003-1852-4286; Paulitsch, Michael/0000-0002-9241-5806; Omland, Patrik/0000-0003-1744-2852; Espinosa, Gustavo/0000-0003-0401-7355",,,,,40,3,3,0,1,IEEE COMPUTER SOC,LOS ALAMITOS,"10662 LOS VAQUEROS CIRCLE, PO BOX 3014, LOS ALAMITOS, CA 90720-1314 USA",1045-9219,1558-2183,,IEEE T PARALL DISTR,IEEE Trans.

First, a com-pact, mobile system was built using an infrared gas analyzer combined with open-source hardware to control, georeference, and log measurements of CO2 mixing ratios on ve-hicles (car, bicycles). Second, two measurement campaigns, one in summer and one in winter (heating season) were carried out. Five mobile sensors were deployed within a 1x12.7 km transect across the city of Vancouver, BC, Canada. The sensors were operated for 3.5 h on pre-defined routes to map CO2 mixing ratios at street level, which were then averaged to 100 x 100m grid cells. The averaged CO2 mixing ratios of all grids in the study area were 417.9 ppm in summer and 442.5 ppm in winter. In both campaigns, mixing ratios were highest in the grid cells of the downtown core and along arterial roads and lowest in parks and well vegetated residential areas. Third, an aerodynamic resistance approach to calculating emissions was used to derive CO2 emissions from the gridded CO2 mixing ratio mea-surements in conjunction with mixing ratios and fluxes collected from a 28 m tall eddycovariance tower located within the study area. These measured emissions showed a range of 12 to 226CO(2) ha 1 h 1 in summer and of -14 to 163 kgCO(2) ha 1 h 1 in winter, with an average of 35.1 kgCO(2) ha (-1) h (-1) (summer) and 25.9 kgCO(2) ha 1 h 1 (winter). Fourth, an independent emissions inventory was developed for the study area using buildings energy simulations from a previous study and routinely available traffic counts. The emissions inventory for the same area averaged to 22.06 kgCO(2) ha (-1) h (-1) (summer) and 28.76 kgCO(2) ha (-1) h (-1) (winter) and was used to compare against the measured emissions from the mobile sensor network. The comparison on a grid-by-grid basis showed linearity between CO2 mixing ratios and the emissions inventory (R (2) =53 in summer and R (2) = 47 in winter). Also, 87% (summer) and 94% (winter) of measured grid cells show a difference within +/- 1 order of magnitude, and 49% (summer) and 69% (winter) show an error of less than a factor 2. Although associated with considerable errors at the individual grid cell level, the study demonstrates a promising method of using a network of mobile sensors and an aerody-namic resistance approach to rapidly map greenhouse gases at high spatial resolution across cities. The method could be improved by longer measurements and a refined calculation of the aerodynamic resistance.","[Lee, Joseph K.; Christen, Andreas; Ketler, Rick; Nesic, Zoran] Univ British Columbia, Dept Geog, Atmospher Sci Program, Vancouver, BC, Canada; [Nesic, Zoran] Univ British Columbia, Fac Land & Food Syst, Biometeorol Grp, Vancouver, BC, Canada",University of British Columbia; University of British Columbia,"Christen, A (corresponding author), Univ British Columbia, Dept Geog, Atmospher Sci Program, Vancouver, BC, Canada.",andreas.christen@ubc.ca,"Nesic, Zoran/C-9655-2015; Christen, Andreas/I-6037-2012","Nesic, Zoran/0000-0001-5728-513X; Christen, Andreas/0000-0003-3864-1703; Lee, Joseph/0000-0002-2344-8954","NSERC Discovery Grant (""Direct measurement of greenhouse gas exchange in urban ecosystems""); Canada Foundation for Innovation [17141, 33600]; NSERC CREATE; Mozilla Science Lab; ""moovel lab"", Stuttgart, Germany","NSERC Discovery Grant (""Direct measurement of greenhouse gas exchange in urban ecosystems"")(Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)); Canada Foundation for Innovation(Canada Foundation for InnovationCGIARSpanish Government); NSERC CREATE(Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)); Mozilla Science Lab; ""moovel lab"", Stuttgart, Germany","This paper was supported through an NSERC Discovery Grant (""Direct measurement of greenhouse gas exchange in urban ecosystems"", A.

This article reviews the opportunity to use FOSH as a sanction to undercut imports and exports from a target criminal country. A formal methodology is presented for selecting strategic national investments in FOSH development to improve both national security and global safety. In this methodology, first the target country that is threatening national security or safety is identified. Next, the top imports from the target country as well as potentially other importing countries (allies) are quantified. Hardware is identified that could undercut imports/exports from the target country. Finally, methods to support the FOSH development are enumerated to support production in a commons-based peer production strategy. To demonstrate how this theoretical method works in practice, it is applied as a case study to a current criminal military aggressor nation, who is also a fossil-fuel exporter. The results show that there are numerous existing FOSH and opportunities to develop new FOSH for energy conservation and renewable energy to reduce fossil-fuel-energy demand. Widespread deployment would reduce the concomitant pollution, human health impacts, and environmental desecration as well as cut financing of military operations.","[Pearce, Joshua M.] Western Univ, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, London, ON N6A 5B9, Canada; [Pearce, Joshua M.] Western Univ, Ivey Business Sch, London, ON N6G 0N1, Canada",Western University (University of Western Ontario); Western University (University of Western Ontario),"Pearce, JM (corresponding author), Western Univ, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, London, ON N6A 5B9, Canada.; Pearce, JM (corresponding author), Western Univ, Ivey Business Sch, London, ON N6G 0N1, Canada.",joshua.pearce@uwo.ca,"Pearce, Joshua/C-9240-2013","Pearce, Joshua/0000-0001-9802-3056",Thompson Endowment,Thompson Endowment,This research was supported by the Thompson Endowment.,,194,6,6,1,4,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2227-7080,,TECHNOLOGIES,Technologies,APR,2022,10,2,,,,,,,53,10.3390/technologies10020053,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/technologies10020053,,,18,"Engineering, Multidisciplinary",Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI),Engineering,0Q7BQ,,"Green Submitted, gold",,,2024-08-15,WOS:000785069700001,,,,538

It also enables rapid prototyping of advanced or novel microscope systems. For long-term time-lapse image data acquisition, slide-scanning or high content analysis, we have developed a novel optical autofocus incorporating orthogonal cylindrical optics to provide robust single-shot closed-loop focus lock, which we have demonstrated to accommodate defocus up to +/- 37 mu mwith <200 nm accuracy, and a two-step autofocus mode which we have shown can operate with defocus up to +/- 68 mu m. We have used this to implement automated single molecule localisation microscopy (SMLM) in a relatively low-cost openFrame-based instrument using multimode diode lasers for excitation and cooled CMOS cameras.","[Lightley, J.; Kumar, S.; Lim, M.

The availability of reduced-pressure ion mobility systems remains limited due to comparatively expensive commercial options and limited shared design features in the open literature. This report details the complete design and benchmarking characteristics of a reduced-pressure ion mobility system. The system is constructed from FR4 PCB electrodes and encased in a PTFE vacuum enclosure with custom torque-tightened couplers to utilize standard KF40 bulkheads. The PTFE enclosure directly minimizes the overall system expenses, and the implementation of threaded brass inserts allows for facile attachments to the vacuum enclosure without damaging the thermoplastic housing. Front and rear ion funnels maximize ion transmission and help mitigate the effects of radial ion diffusion. A custom planar ion shuttle transports ions from the exit of the rear ion funnel into the ion optics of an ion trap mass analyzer. The planar ion shuttle can couple the IM system to any contemporary Thermo Scientific ion trap mass analyzer. Signal stability and ion intensity remain unchanging following the implementation of the planar ion shuttle when compared to the original stacked ring ion guide. The constructed IM system showed resolving powers up to 85 for various small molecules and proteins using the Fourier transform from a similar to 1 m drift tube. Recorded mobilities derived from first principles agree with published literature results with an average error of 1.1% and an average error toward literature values using single field calibration of <1.3%.","[Buzitis, Nathan W.; Clowers, Brian H.] Washington State Univ, Dept Chem, Pullman, WA 99164 USA",Washington State University,"Clowers, BH (corresponding author), Washington State Univ, Dept Chem, Pullman, WA 99164 USA.",brian.clowers@wsu.edu,,"Buzitis, Nathan/0009-0009-3510-2887",National Institute of General Medical Sciences [R01GM138863]; NIH,National Institute of General Medical Sciences(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS)); NIH(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA),Support for this effort was supplied by the NIH (NIGMS Grant R01GM138863),,62,0,0,4,4,AMER CHEMICAL SOC,WASHINGTON,"1155 16TH ST, NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA",1044-0305,1879-1123,,J AM SOC MASS SPECTR,J.

This can be achieved through the collection of high contrast, data rich, and insightful microstructural maps. Electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) has emerged as a popular tool available within the scanning electron microscope (SEM), where maps are realized through the repeat capture and analysis of Kikuchi diffraction patterns. Typical commercial EBSD systems require large and sophisticated detectors that are mounted on the side of the SEM vacuum chamber which can be limiting in terms of widespread access to the technique. In this work, we present an alternative open-hardware solution based upon a compact EBSD system with a simple, static geometry that uses an off-the-shelf direct electron detector co-mounted with a sample. This simple stage is easy to manufacture and improves our knowledge of the diffraction geometry significantly. Microscope and detector control is achieved through software application programming interface (API) integration. After pattern capture, analysis of the diffraction patterns is performed using open-source analysis within AstroEBSD. To demonstrate the potential of this set up, we present two simple EBSD experiments using a line scan and area mapping. We hope that the present system can inspire simpler EBSD system design for widespread access to the EBSD technique and promote the use of open-source software and hardware in the workflow of EBSD experiments.","[Zhang, Tianbi; Ben Britton, T.] Univ British Columbia, Dept Mat Engn, 309-6350 Stores Rd, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z4, Canada",University of British Columbia,"Ben Britton, T (corresponding author), Univ British Columbia, Dept Mat Engn, 309-6350 Stores Rd, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z4, Canada.",ben.britton@ubc.ca,,,,,,,43,0,0,3,3,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",0968-4328,1878-4291,,MICRON,Micron,MAR,2024,178,,,,,,,,103582,10.1016/j.micron.2023.103582,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.micron.2023.103582,,Jan 2024,10,Microscopy,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Microscopy,HF0U2,38181589.0,Green Submitted,,,2024-08-15,WOS:001157968600001,,,,542

Despite technological advances and a need for methodological improvements, chromogenic and fluorogenic enzymatic techniques remain the mainstays of water quality monitoring for both public health agencies and regulated utilities. We demonstrated that bioelectroanalytical approaches to FIB enumeration are possible and can be achieved using commercially available enzyme-specific resorufin glycosides, although these are expensive, not widely available or designed for purpose. Following this, we designed two naphthoquinone glycosides which performed better, achieving Escherichia coli detection in the range 5.0x10(2) to 5.0x10(5) CFUml(-1) 22-54% quicker than commercially available resorufin glycosides. The molecular design of the naphthoquinone glycosides requires fewer synthetic steps allowing them to be produced for as little as US$50 per kg. Tests with environmental samples demonstrated the low tendency for abiotic interference and that, despite specificity being maintained between -glucuronidase and -galactosidase, accurate enumeration of E.coli in environmental samples necessitates development of a selective medium. In comparison to a commercially available detection method, which has U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) approval, our approach performed better at high organism concentrations, detecting 500 organisms in 9h compared with 13.5h for the commercial method. Bioelectroanalytical detection is comparable to current approved methods and with further development could result in improved detection times. A recent trend for low-cost open-source hardware means that automated, potentiostatically controlled E.coli detection systems could be constructed for less than US$100 per channel.","[Hinks, Jamie; Han, Evelina J.

We present a unique solution using open-source hardware, software, and 3D printing to automate dispenser accuracy determination by providing real-time dispense weight measurements via a network-connected precision balance. This system uses an Arduino microcontroller to connect a precision balance to a local network. By integrating the precision balance as an Internet of Things (IoT) device, it gains the ability to provide real-time gravimetric summaries of dispensing, generate timely alerts when problems are detected, and capture historical dispensing data for future analysis. All collected data can then be accessed via a web interface for reviewing alerts and dispensing information in real time or remotely for timely intervention of dispense errors. The development of this system also leveraged 3D printing to rapidly prototype sensor brackets, mounting solutions, and component enclosures.","[Shumate, Justin; Baillargeon, Pierre; Spicer, Timothy P.; Scampavia, Louis] Scripps Florida, Scripps Res Inst, Mol Screening Ctr, 130 Scripps Way 1A1, Jupiter, FL 33458 USA; [Shumate, Justin; Baillargeon, Pierre; Spicer, Timothy P.; Scampavia, Louis] Scripps Florida, Dept Mol Med, 130 Scripps Way 1A1, Jupiter, FL 33458 USA",State University System of Florida; University of Florida; Herbert Wertheim UF Scripps Institute for Biomedical Innovation & Technology; State University System of Florida; University of Florida; Herbert Wertheim UF Scripps Institute for Biomedical Innovation & Technology,"Scampavia, L (corresponding author), Scripps Florida, Scripps Res Inst, Mol Screening Ctr, 130 Scripps Way 1A1, Jupiter, FL 33458 USA.; Scampavia, L (corresponding author), Scripps Florida, Dept Mol Med, 130 Scripps Way 1A1, Jupiter, FL 33458 USA.",scampl@scripps.edu,"Baillargeon, Pierre/C-3000-2018","Baillargeon, Pierre/0000-0003-4431-1372",,,,,14,13,13,0,13,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",2472-6303,2472-6311,,SLAS TECHNOL,SLAS Technol.,OCT,2018,23,5,,,SI,,440,447,,10.1177/2472630318769454,http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/2472630318769454,,,8,"Biochemical Research Methods; Chemistry, Analytical",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Biochemistry & Molecular Biology; Chemistry,GU4EU,29649373.0,hybrid,,,2024-08-15,WOS:000445235700006,,,,548

The second is an automatic layer -by -layer hybridization enabled by the software ""SuperSlicer"". This method requires no machining knowledge but only allows contouring operations. Results of experiments show that the spindle presented in this work is capable of successfully carrying out a hybrid process that significantly improves the surface roughness parameters, with an improvement factor of 10 for most parameters. An uniformization of surface roughness parameters was also observed in the construction direction and in the deposition/machining direction. The layer -by -layer hybridization yields the better results in terms of surface roughness. This is because the reduced depth of cut (equivalent to a printed layer) minimizes stress and temperature rise, resulting in highly favorable cutting conditions.","[Martinez, Luis Vincent Tejada; Witz, Jean-Francois] CNRS UMR 9013 LaMcube Lab Mecan Multiphys Multiech, Lille, France; Cent Lille, Cite Sci, F-59650 Villeneuve Dascq, France; Polytech Lille, Av Paul Langevin, F-59655 Villeneuve Dascq, France",Universite de Lille; Centrale Lille; Universite de Lille,"Martinez, LVT; Witz, JF (corresponding author), CNRS UMR 9013 LaMcube Lab Mecan Multiphys Multiech, Lille, France.",luis.tejada@univ-lille.fr; jean-francois.witz@centralelille.fr,,"Lesaffre, Francois/0009-0000-6994-1261",Haut de France region; European Regional Development Fund; The 3D printer manufacturer Dagoma; INTERREG Fance-Wallonie-Vlaanderen program,Haut de France region; European Regional Development Fund(European Union (EU)); The 3D printer manufacturer Dagoma; INTERREG Fance-Wallonie-Vlaanderen program,"The first part of this article was produced as part of the Fabricar3v project www.fabricar3v.eu.

Electrical stimuli, applied across the mastoid processes, selectively activate primary vestibular afferents which has spurred clinical and biomedical applications of electrical vestibular stimulation (EVS). When properly matched to head motion, EVS may also manipulate the closed-loop relationship between actions and vestibular feedback to reveal the mechanisms of sensorimotor recalibration and learning. New method: We designed a portable, low-cost real-time EVS system using an Arduino microcontroller programmed through Simulink that provides electrical currents based on head angular motion. We used well-characterized vestibular afferent physiological responses to head angular velocity and electrical current to compute head-motion equivalent of real-time modulatory EVS currents. We also examined if our system induced recalibration of the vestibular system during human balance control. Results: Our system operated at 199.997 Hz ( +/- 0.005 Hz) and delivered head-motion-equivalent electrical currents with similar to 10 ms delay. The output driving the current stimulator matched the implemented linear model for physiological vestibular afferent dynamics with minimal background noise (<0.2% of +/- 10 V range). Participants recalibrated to the modulated closed-loop vestibular feedback using visual cues during standing balance, replicating earlier findings. Comparison with existing methods: EVS is typically used to impose external perturbations that are independent of one's own movement. We provided a solution using open-source hardware to implement a real-time, physiology based, and task-relevant vestibular modulations using EVS. Conclusions: Our portable, low-cost vestibular modulation system will make physiological closed-loop vestibular manipulations more accessible thus encouraging novel investigations and biomedical applications of EVS.","[Chen, Anthony; Blouin, Jean-Sebastien] Univ British Columbia, Sch Kinesiol, Vancouver, BC, Canada; [Kuo, Calvin] Univ British Columbia, Sch Biomed Engn, Vancouver, BC, Canada; [Blouin, Jean-Sebastien] Univ British Columbia, Djavad Mowafaghian Ctr Brain Hlth, Vancouver, BC, Canada; [Blouin, Jean-Sebastien] Univ British Columbia, Inst Comp Informat & Cognit Syst, Vancouver, BC, Canada; [Blouin, Jean-Sebastien] 210 6081 Univ Blvd, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z1, Canada",University of British Columbia; University of British Columbia; University of British Columbia; University of British Columbia,"Blouin, JS (corresponding author), 210 6081 Univ Blvd, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z1, Canada.",chen93@student.ubc.ca; calvin.kuo@ubc.ca; jsblouin@mail.ubc.ca,,,,,,,79,4,4,1,2,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0165-0270,1872-678X,,J NEUROSCI METH,J.

The proposed RCP system consists of a PC-based computer-aided control system design (CACSD) tool for computing control action and tiny palm-sized open source hardware for input and output (I/O) operation and data transfer through a built-in high-speed USB interface. The popular-priced and portable open source hardware is used as a bridge between CACSD tools and real plants to deliver the control and sensor data at the sampling time points. Ten I/O function blocks written in C code are developed based on the CACSD tool employed for the proposed light-weight RCP system in order to handle I/O operation in a simple way. In addition, we suggest two practical strategies, a batch transfer strategy and a variable sampling period method, to increase the sampling rate of the control system. It is shown through experiment that the proposed light-weight RCP system works well up to a sampling rate of 2 kHz without adopting expensive hardware and C code generators. It is expected that the proposed RCP system will be considered as affordable and readily available to schools for mass education.","[Lee, Young Sam; Jo, Bongeon] Inha Univ, Dept Elect Engn, Incheon 22212, South Korea; [Han, Soohee] Pohang Univ Sci & Technol, Pohang 37673, South Korea",Inha University; Pohang University of Science & Technology (POSTECH),"Lee, YS (corresponding author), Inha Univ, Dept Elect Engn, Incheon 22212, South Korea.",lys@inha.ac.kr,,,Inha University,Inha University,This work was supported by Inha University Research Grant.,,26,7,7,0,6,IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC,PISCATAWAY,"445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA",2169-3536,,,IEEE ACCESS,IEEE Access,,2017,5,,,,,,11118,11130,,10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2715184,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2715184,,,13,"Computer Science, Information Systems; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Telecommunications",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Computer Science; Engineering; Telecommunications,EZ1QW,,gold,,,2024-08-15,WOS:000404486900022,,,,552

However, those drones are mainly used in the unmanned aerial vehicles. We believe that underwater drones will become a big research topic and find a market in the near future.

The designs are based on the open-source hardware and will be shared as an open-source for contributing to the innovation of manufacturing including drone. The function of the 360 degrees panoramic camera is generated by correcting the images taken by two fisheye lenses. The underwater drone was designed by extending the Raspberry Pi compute module, the frame was designed by OpenSCAD, and the printed circuit board was designed by MakePro. As for the application of the underwater drone, we focused on fish recognition for investigating fish species in a natural lake to help protect the original environment.

An effective, reusable, locally-manufactured respirator can mitigate this problem. We describe the development, manufacture, and preliminary testing of an open-hardware-licensed device, the ""simple silicone mask"" (SSM). Methods A multidisciplinary team developed a reusable silicone half facepiece respirator over 9 prototype iterations. The manufacturing process consisted of 3D printing and silicone casting. Prototypes were assessed for comfort and breathability. Filtration was assessed by user seal checks and quantitative fit-testing according to CSA Z94.4-18. Results The respirator originally included a cartridge for holding filter material; this was modified to connect to standard heat-moisture exchange (HME) filters (N95 or greater) after the cartridge showed poor filtration performance due to flow acceleration around the filter edges, which was exacerbated by high filter resistance. All 8 HME-based iterations provided an adequate seal by user seal checks and achieved a pass rate of 87.5% (N = 8) on quantitative testing, with all failures occurring in the first iteration. The overall median fit-factor was 1662 (100 = pass). Estimated unit cost for a production run of 1000 using distributed manufacturing techniques is CAD $15 in materials and 20 minutes of labor. Conclusion Small-scale manufacturing of an effective, reusable N95 respirator during a pandemic is feasible and cost-effective. Required quantities of reusables are more predictable and less vulnerable to supply chain disruption than disposables. With further evaluation, such devices may be an alternative to disposable respirators during public health emergencies. The respirator described above is an investigational device and requires further evaluation and regulatory requirements before clinical deployment. The authors and affiliates do not endorse the use of this device at present.","[Anwari, Vahid] Univ Hlth Network, Toronto Gen Hosp, Joint Dept Med Imaging, Toronto, ON, Canada; [Anwari, Vahid; Kazlovich, Kate; Hiansen, Joshua; Mashari, Azad] Univ Hlth Network, Toronto Gen Hosp, Dept Anesthesiol & Pain Management, Lynn & Arnold Irwin Adv Perioperat Imaging Lab, Toronto, ON, Canada; [Ng, William C.

As such, distributing these sensors across a robot's body could be beneficial for operation in human environments. We present a stretchable fabric-based skin with force and thermal sensors that is suitable for covering areas of a robot's body, including curved surfaces. It also adds a layer of compliance that conforms to manipulated objects, improving thermal sensing. Our open hardware design addresses thermal sensing challenges, such as the time to heat the sensors, the efficiency of sensing, and the distribution of sensors across the skin. It incorporates small self-heated temperature sensors on the surface of the skin that directly make contact with objects, improving the sensors' response times. Our approach seeks to fully cover the robot's body with large force sensors, but treats temperature sensors as small, point-like sensors sparsely distributed across the skin. We present a mathematical model to help predict how many of these point-like temperature sensors should be used in order to increase the likelihood of them making contact with an object. To evaluate our design, we conducted tests in which a robot arm used a cylindrical end effector covered with skin to slide objects and press on objects made from four different materials. After assessing the safety of our design, we also had the robot make contact with the forearms and clothed shoulders of 10 human participants. With 2.0 s of contact, the actively-heated temperature sensors enabled binary classification accuracy over 90% for the majority of material pairs. The system could more rapidly distinguish between materials with large differences in their thermal effusivities (e.g., 90% accuracy for pine wood vs. aluminum with 0.5 s of contact). For discrimination between humans vs. the four materials, the skin's force and thermal sensing modalities achieved 93% classification accuracy with 0.5 s of contact. Overall, our results suggest that our skin design could enable robots to recognize contact with distinct task-relevant materials and humans while performing manipulation tasks in human environments.

This approach enables the targeted recording from fluorescent reporter protein expressing neurons or glial cells in brain slices and fluorescence-assisted electrophysiological recordings from subcellular structures. However, the existing tools to mix multiple light sources in one-photon microscopy are limited. Here, we present the development of several microcontroller devices that provide temporal and intensity control of light emitting diodes (LEDs) for computer controlled microscopy illumination. We interfaced one microcontroller with mu Manager for rapid and dynamic overlay of transmitted and fluorescent images. Moreover, on the basis of this illumination system we implemented an electronic circuit to combine two pulsed LED light sources for fast (up to 1 kHz) ratiometric calcium (Ca2+) imaging. This microcontroller enabled the calibration of intracellular Ca2+ concentration and furthermore the combination of Ca2+ imaging with optogenetic activation. The devices are based on affordable components and open-source hardware and software. Integration into existing bright-field microscope systems will take similar to 1 day. The microcontroller based LED imaging substantially advances conventional illumination methods by limiting light exposure and adding versatility and speed.","[Battefeld, Arne; Popovic, Marko A.; Kole, Maarten H.

Due to the flexibility of the hardware, firmware, and software architectures, the platform is capable of interfacing with a wide variety of detector modules not only in medical imaging but also in homeland security applications. Analog signals from radiation detectors share similar characteristics-a pulse whose area is proportional to the deposited energy and whose leading edge is used to extract a timing signal. As a result, a generic design method of the platform is adopted for the hardware, firmware, and software architectures and implementations. The analog front-end is hosted on a module called a Detector Board, where each board can filter, combine, timestamp, and process multiple channels independently. The processed data is formatted and sent through a backplane bus to a module called Support Board, where 1 Support Board can host up to eight Detector Board modules. The data in the Support Board, coming from 8 Detector Board modules, can be aggregated or correlated (if needed) depending on the algorithm implemented or runtime mode selected. It is then sent out to a computer workstation for further processing. The number of channels (detector modules), to be processed, mandates the overall OpenPET System Configuration, which is designed to handle up to 1,024 channels using 16-channel Detector Boards in the Standard System Configuration and 16,384 channels using 32-channel Detector Boards in the Large System Configuration.","[Abu-Nimeh, Faisal T.; Ito, Jennifer; Moses, William W.; Peng, Qiyu; Choong, Woon-Seng] Univ Calif Berkeley, Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA",University of California System; University of California Berkeley; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory,"Abu-Nimeh, FT (corresponding author), Univ Calif Berkeley, Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",ftabunimeh@lbl.gov,,"Abu-Nimeh, Faisal/0000-0001-9009-9953","Office of Science, Office of Biological and Environmental Research, Medical Science Division of the U.S. Department of Energy [DE-AC02-05CH11231]; National Institutes of Health, National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering [R01EB016104]","Office of Science, Office of Biological and Environmental Research, Medical Science Division of the U.S. Department of Energy(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); National Institutes of Health, National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Biomedical Imaging & Bioengineering (NIBIB))","This work was supported in part by the Director, Office of Science, Office of Biological and Environmental Research, Medical Science Division of the U.S. Department of Energy under Contract DE-AC02-05CH11231, and in part by the National Institutes of Health, National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering under Grant R01EB016104.",,3,5,5,0,8,IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC,PISCATAWAY,"445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA",0018-9499,1558-1578,,IEEE T NUCL SCI,IEEE Trans.

This paper presents an open-source hardware upgrade for low-cost 3D printers to enable research on new high-temperature polymers as well as manufacturing from all currently available polymers. The hardware cost less than $1700, including the printer. Open-source firmware by Klipper and Fluidd is used for control. The printer is able to reach 500 degrees C nozzle, 200 degrees C heated bed, and 135 degrees C heated chamber with all electronics inside operating within the recommended temperature range. The presented design produced a CF-PEEK 3DBenchy and a spiral vase with excellent surface quality and no signs of delam-ination. Test specimens according to ISO527 using PA-CF performed similarly to the data-sheet provided by the manufacturer for samples produced in the XY-orientation and outperformed the datasheet by 15 % in the ZX direction. Compared to specimens made on an Original Prusa i3 MK3S, the modified printer produced specimens with 22% higher strength in the YX-direction and 25% in ZX.

The systemallows control over current amplitude, frequency, number of electrodes, injection protocol and data processing. Current is injected using a Keithley 6221 current source, and voltages are recordedwith a 24-bit EEGsystemwithminimumbandwidth of 3.2 kHz. Custom PCBs interface with a PC to control the measurement process, electrode addressing and triggering of external stimuli. The performance of the system was characterised using resistor phantoms to represent human scalp recordings, with an SNR of 77.5 dB, stable across a four hour recording and 20 Hz to 20 kHz. In studies of both haeomorrhage using scalp electrodes, and evoked activity using epicortical electrode mats in rats, it was possible to reconstruct images matching established literature at known areas of onset. Data collected using scalp electrode in humans matched known tissue impedance spectra and was stable over frequency. The experimental procedure is software controlled and is readily adaptable to new paradigms. Where possible, commercial or open-source components were used, to minimise the complexity in reproduction. The hardware designs and software for the system have been released under an open source licence, encouraging contributions and allowing for rapid replication.","[Avery, James; Dowrick, Thomas; Faulkner, Mayo; Goren, Nir; Holder, David] UCL, Dept Med Phys & Biomed Engn, London WC1E 6BT, England",University of London; University College London,"Avery, J (corresponding author), UCL, Dept Med Phys & Biomed Engn, London WC1E 6BT, England.",j.avery@ucl.ac.uk; t.dowrick@ucl.ac.uk; mayo.faulkner@ucl.ac.uk; n.goren@ucl.ac.uk; d.holder@ucl.ac.uk,"Avery, James/C-8526-2018","Avery, James/0000-0002-4015-1802; holder, david/0000-0003-2755-6124",EPSRC [EP/M506448/1]; MRC [MR/K00767X/1]; MRC [MR/K00767X/1] Funding Source: UKRI,EPSRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)); MRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Medical Research Council UK (MRC)); MRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Medical Research Council UK (MRC)),This work was supported by EPSRC grant EP/M506448/1 and MRC grant MR/K00767X/1.,,51,75,76,2,31,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,1424-8220,,SENSORS-BASEL,Sensors,FEB,2017,17,2,,,,,,,280,10.3390/s17020280,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/s17020280,,,20,"Chemistry, Analytical; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Instruments & Instrumentation",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Chemistry; Engineering; Instruments & Instrumentation,EM7HS,28146122.0,"Green Published, Green Submitted, gold",,,2024-08-15,WOS:000395482700064,,,,562

There is a growing demand for in situ iceberg tracking data to monitor their drift trajectories and improve models used for operational forecasting of ice hazards, yet the high cost of commercial tracking devices often prevents monitoring at optimal spatial and temporal resolutions. Here, we provide a detailed description of the Cryologger Ice Tracking Beacon (ITB), a low-cost, robust, and user-friendly data logger and telemeter for tracking icebergs and ice islands based on the Arduino open-source electronics platform. Designed for deployments of at least 2 years with an hourly sampling interval that is remotely modifiable by the end user, the Cryologger ITB provides long-term measurements of position, temperature, pressure, pitch, roll, heading, and battery voltage. Data are transmitted via the Iridium satellite network at user-specified intervals. We present the results of field campaigns in 2018 and 2019, which saw the deployment of 16 ITBs along the coasts of Greenland and Ellesmere and Baffin islands. The overall success of these ITB deployments has demonstrated that inexpensive, open-source hardware and software can provide a reliable and cost-effective method of monitoring icebergs and ice islands in the polar regions.","[Garbo, Adam; Mueller, Derek] Carleton Univ, Dept Geog & Environm Studies, Water & Ice Res Lab, 1125 Colonel By Drive, Ottawa, ON K1S 5B6, Canada",Carleton University,"Garbo, A (corresponding author), Carleton Univ, Dept Geog & Environm Studies, Water & Ice Res Lab, 1125 Colonel By Drive, Ottawa, ON K1S 5B6, Canada.",adam.garbo@carleton.ca,,"Garbo, Adam/0000-0002-7312-7390; Mueller, Derek/0000-0003-1974-319X","ArcticNet, a Network of Centers of Excellence of Canada","ArcticNet, a Network of Centers of Excellence of Canada","This project would not have been possible without the designs, software, and tutorials provided by the open-source community.

This software allows enabling/disabling the relays that connect the sockets that power the chargers of up to 4 mobile devices minimizing the need for human intervention. The firmware runs a web server that serves Rest requests from a Rest client with the commands to drive the digital outputs. These digital outputs activate or deactivate the relays to allow current to pass or not to the sockets. Such capability is essential to automate the study of battery behavior on battery-driven devices such as smartphones.

This system reduced seawater pH up to -0.9 units and increased temperature up to +6 degrees C in three treatments and a control. Treatments can be continuously compared with the control and vary according to diel fluctuations, thus following the diel range observed in the sea.

Fluorescence measurement is typically achieved by utilizing a blue or red monochromatic excitation light source. However, algal photosynthetic pigments can differ in their absorption spectra, potentially leading to excitation wavelength dependent measurements of maximal and light acclimated PSII photosynthetic quantum yield (Fv/Fm or Fq'/Fm') and functional absorption cross section (sigma(PSII) or sigma(PSII)). Here we utilized an open source hardware development platform to construct a multispectral excitation fluorometer to assess spectrally dependent differences in photochemistry within four different Symbiodinium species (two of each ITS2-type A4 and B1). Multivariate analysis of light acclimated photochemical signatures showed separation between most alga types. These spectrally dependent differences in light acclimated PSII efficiency and PSII functional absorption cross section likely reflect changes in light harvesting compounds, their connectivity to the PSII reaction centers and the balance between photochemical and non-photochemical fluorescence quenching. Additionally, acclimation to low (20 iLmol photons M-2 s(-1)) and high (200 mu mol photons m(-2) s(-1)) light conditions was examined in two of these symbionts types (ITS-2 type A4 and B1) As expected, chlorophyll a cell(-1) decreased under high light acclimation in both symbionts. However, only A4 saw a subsequent reduction in absorbance whereas cellular volume decreased in the B1 (S. minutum) symbiont. In response to high light acclimation, Fv/Fm was significantly lower at all excitation wavelengths for the B1 symbiont where as efficiencies remained the same for A4. However, high-light acclimated Fq'/Fm' levels decreased in both symbionts, but only when measured using the 615 or 625 nm excitation wavelengths. Non-photochemical quenching within the antennae bed was downregulated under high light acclimation in the A4 symbiont, but only when measured using the 505 and 530 nm excitation wavelengths. Such changes in Fq'/Fm' and antennae bed quenching highlight the benefits of spectrally resolved photochemical measurements. Additionally, the utilization of Arduino and Bitscope hardware exemplifies the potential of open source development platforms for construction of highly customizable instrumentation for photosynthetic research.","[Hoadley, Kenneth D.; Warner, Mark E.] Univ Delaware, Sch Marine Sci & Policy, Lewes, DE 19958 USA; [Hoadley, Kenneth D.] Monterey Bay Aquarium Res Inst, Moss Landing, CA 95039 USA",University of Delaware; Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute,"Hoadley, KD (corresponding author), Univ Delaware, Sch Marine Sci & Policy, Lewes, DE 19958 USA.; Hoadley, KD (corresponding author), Monterey Bay Aquarium Res Inst, Moss Landing, CA 95039 USA.",khoadley@mbari.org,"Warner, Mark E/J-6241-2013","Warner, Mark/0000-0003-1015-9413; Hoadley, Kenneth/0000-0002-9287-181X","National Science Foundation [1316055, 1258065]; Division Of Integrative Organismal Systems; Direct For Biological Sciences [1258065] Funding Source: National Science Foundation; Emerging Frontiers; Direct For Biological Sciences [1316055] Funding Source: National Science Foundation",National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Division Of Integrative Organismal Systems; Direct For Biological Sciences(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Biological Sciences (BIO)NSF - Division of Integrative Organismal Systems (IOS)); Emerging Frontiers; Direct For Biological Sciences(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Biological Sciences (BIO)),This project was supported by funding from the National Science Foundation (awards 1316055 and 1258065 to MW).,,44,14,14,3,10,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,LAUSANNE,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",,2296-7745,,FRONT MAR SCI,Front.

The sensor, costing less than 50 USD is open-source, open-hardware, compact, and easily interfaceable to a wide range of data-logging systems. A freely available sensor design at this price point does not currently exist, and its novelty is in enabling high-resolution real-time monitoring schemes. The design is capable of measuring water velocities up to 1200 mm/s. The sensor is characterised and then verified in an in-field long-term test.

Many small and specialty laboratories are excluded from the benefits of automation due to low sample number, cost, space, and/or lack of automation expertise. The Minimum Viable Option (MVO) automation platform was developed to address these hurdles and fulfill an unmet need. Consumer 3D printing enabled rapid iterative prototyping to allow for a variety of instrumentation and assay setups and procedures. Three MVO versions have been produced. MVOv1.1 successfully performed part of a clinical assay, and results were comparable to those of commercial automation. Raspberry Pi 3 Model B (RPI3) single-board computers with Sense Hardware Attached on Top (HAT) and Raspberry Pi Camera Module V2 hardware were remotely accessed and evaluated for their suitability to qualify the latest MVOv1.2 platform. Sense HAT temperature, barometric pressure, and relative humidity sensors were stable in climate-controlled environments and are useful in identifying appropriate laboratory spaces for automation placement. The RPI3 with camera plus digital dial indicator logged axis travel experiments. RPI3 with camera and Sense HAT as a light source showed promise when used for photometric dispensing tests. Individual well standard curves were necessary for well-to-well light and path length compensations.","[Iglehart, Brian] Johns Hopkins Univ, Sch Med, Dept Med, Baltimore, MD 21205 USA",Johns Hopkins University,"Iglehart, B (corresponding author), Johns Hopkins Univ, Sch Med, Immunogenet Lab, 2041 E Monument St, Baltimore, MD 21205 USA.",bigle@jhmi.edu,,,,,,,12,6,6,0,8,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",2472-6303,2472-6311,,SLAS TECHNOL,SLAS Technol.,OCT,2018,23,5,,,SI,,423,431,,10.1177/2472630318773693,http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/2472630318773693,,,9,"Biochemical Research Methods; Chemistry, Analytical",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Biochemistry & Molecular Biology; Chemistry,GU4EU,29746790.0,hybrid,,,2024-08-15,WOS:000445235700004,,,,570

This approach is refined here to develop a novel instrument capable of performing automated large-area four-point probe measurements. The designs for conversion of a RepRap 3-D printer to a 2-D open source four-point probe (OS4PP) measurement device are detailed for the mechanical and electrical systems. Free and open source software and firmware are developed to operate the tool. The OS4PP was validated against a wide range of discrete resistors and indium tin oxide (ITO) samples of different thicknesses both pre- and post-annealing. The OS4PP was then compared to two commercial proprietary systems. Results of resistors from 10 to 1 M show errors of less than 1% for the OS4PP. The 3-D mapping of sheet resistance of ITO samples successfully demonstrated the automated capability to measure non-uniformities in large-area samples. The results indicate that all measured values are within the same order of magnitude when compared to two proprietary measurement systems. In conclusion, the OS4PP system, which costs less than 70% of manual proprietary systems, is comparable electrically while offering automated 100 micron positional accuracy for measuring sheet resistance over larger areas.","[Chandra, Handy; Allen, Spencer W.; Oberloier, Shane W.; Pearce, Joshua M.] Michigan Technol Univ, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, Houghton, MI 49931 USA; [Bihari, Nupur; Gwamuri, Jephias; Pearce, Joshua M.] Michigan Technol Univ, Dept Mat Sci & Engn, Houghton, MI 49931 USA",Michigan Technological University; Michigan Technological University,"Pearce, JM (corresponding author), Michigan Technol Univ, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, Houghton, MI 49931 USA.; Pearce, JM (corresponding author), Michigan Technol Univ, Dept Mat Sci & Engn, Houghton, MI 49931 USA.",handyc@mtu.edu; swallen@mtu.edu; swoberlo@mtu.edu; nbihari@mtu.edu; jgwamuri@mtu.edu; pearce@mtu.edu,"Gwamuri, Jephias/AAA-2383-2020; Pearce, Joshua/D-2052-2010","Pearce, Joshua/0000-0001-9802-3056; Gwamuri, Jephias/0000-0003-1806-6799; Oberloier, Shane/0000-0002-2727-9713",Fulbright program,Fulbright program,The authors would like to acknowledge support from the Fulbright program during the whole course of this work.,,69,25,28,1,15,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,1996-1944,,MATERIALS,Materials,FEB,2017,10,2,,,,,,,110,10.3390/ma10020110,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ma10020110,,,17,"Chemistry, Physical; Materials Science, Multidisciplinary; Metallurgy & Metallurgical Engineering; Physics, Applied; Physics, Condensed Matter",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Chemistry; Materials Science; Metallurgy & Metallurgical Engineering; Physics,EM6TT,28772471.0,"Green Published, gold",,,2024-08-15,WOS:000395445800017,,,,571

This system decides whether the current block belongs to the object region or not. In this article, a scheme using background modeling based on runtime-weighted features for robustly adaptive moving object segmentation in infrared (IR) image sequence is proposed. Proposed background modeling for an open hardware (H/W) architecture design decreases the size of the search area to construct a sparse block template of search area in infrared images. The authors also compensate for motion compensation when the image moves in previous and current frames of IR imaging system. The method of separation of background and objects applies to adaptive values through time analysis of pixel intensity The proposed method uses more feature information such as intensity, deviation, block matching error, and velocity. The weighting values give a higher weight to feature information which has a large difference between the object and the background region. Based on experimental results, the proposed method showed real-time moving object segmentation through background modeling in the proposed embedded system.

The system can acquire two analog and two digital signals, and control two external LEDs via built in LED drivers. Time-division multiplexed illumination allows independent readout of fluorescence evoked by different excitation wavelengths from a single photoreceiver signal. Validation experiments indicate this approach offers better signal to noise for a given average excitation light intensity than sinusoidally-modulated illumination. pyPhotometry is substantially cheaper than commercial hardware filling the same role, and we anticipate, as an open source and comparatively simple tool, it will be easily adaptable and therefore of broad interest to a wide range of users.","[Akam, Thomas; Walton, Mark E.] Univ Oxford, Dept Expt Psychol, Oxford, England; [Akam, Thomas] Champalimaud Ctr Unknown, Champalimaud Neurosci Program, Lisbon, Portugal",University of Oxford; Fundacao Champalimaud,"Akam, T (corresponding author), Univ Oxford, Dept Expt Psychol, Oxford, England.; Akam, T (corresponding author), Champalimaud Ctr Unknown, Champalimaud Neurosci Program, Lisbon, Portugal.",thomas.akam@psy.ox.ac.uk,,,Wellcome Senior Research Fellowship [202831/Z/16/Z],Wellcome Senior Research Fellowship(Wellcome Trust),"We thank Laura Grima for providing the dopamine neuron recording shown in Figure 5a, b, and for comments on the manuscript.

All-iron batteries can store energy by reducing iron (II) to metallic iron at the anode and oxidizing iron (II) to iron (III) at the cathode. The total cell is highly stable, efficient, non-toxic, and safe. The total cost of materials is $0.1 per watt-hour of capacity at wholesale prices.

However, since the absolute power in EEG decreases rapidly with increasing frequency following a ""1/f"" power law, and the gamma band includes line noise frequency, these oscillations are highly susceptible to instrument noise. Previous studies that recorded stimulus-induced gamma oscillations used expensive research-grade EEG amplifiers to address this issue. While low-cost EEG amplifiers have become popular in Brain Computer Interface applications that mainly rely on low-frequency oscillations (< 30 Hz) or steady-state-visually-evoked-potentials, whether they can also be used to measure stimulus-induced gamma oscillations is unknown. We recorded EEG signals using a low-cost, open-source amplifier (OpenBCI) and a traditional, research-grade amplifier (Brain Products GmbH), both connected to the OpenBCI cap, in male (N = 6) and female (N = 5) subjects (22-29 years) while they viewed full-screen static gratings that are known to induce two distinct gamma oscillations: slow and fast gamma, in a subset of subjects. While the EEG signals from OpenBCI were considerably noisier, we found that out of the seven subjects who showed a gamma response in Brain Products recordings, six showed a gamma response in OpenBCI as well. In spite of the noise in the OpenBCI setup, the spectral and temporal profiles of these responses in alpha (8-13 Hz) and gamma bands were highly correlated between OpenBCI and Brain Products recordings. These results suggest that low-cost amplifiers can potentially be used in stimulus-induced gamma response detection.","[Pattisapu, Srividya; Ray, Supratim] Indian Inst Sci, Ctr Neurosci, Bengaluru, India",Indian Institute of Science (IISC) - Bangalore,"Ray, S (corresponding author), Indian Inst Sci, Ctr Neurosci, Bengaluru, India.",sray@iisc.ac.in,,"Ray, Supratim/0000-0002-1968-1382; Pattisapu, Srividya/0000-0001-7047-1754",Wellcome Trust/DBT India Alliance [IA/S/18/2/504003]; DBT-IISc Partnership Programme,Wellcome Trust/DBT India Alliance(Wellcome TrustWellcome Trust DBT India Alliance); DBT-IISc Partnership Programme(Newton-Al-Farabi Partnership Programme),"This work was supported by Wellcome Trust/DBT India Alliance (Senior fellowship IA/S/18/2/504003 to S.R.), and DBT-IISc Partnership Programme.

To this end, it provides an easily usable task-based programming abstraction, and combines this with powerful tool support to automatically implement the individual hardware accelerators and integrate them into usable system-on-chips. Currently, TaPaSCo relies on the host to manage task parallelism and perform the actual task launches. However, for more expressive parallel programming patterns, such as pipelines of task farms, the round trips from the hardware accelerators back to the host for launching child tasks, especially when exploiting data-dependent execution times, quickly add up. The major contribution of this work is the addition of on-chip task scheduling and launching capabilities to TaPaSCo. This enables not only low-latency dynamic task parallelism, it also encompasses the efficient on-chip exchange of parameter values and task results between parent and child accelerator tasks. For larger distributed systems, the dynamic launch capability can even be extended over the network to span multiple FPGAs. Our solution is able to handle recursive task structures, and is shown to achieve latency reductions of over 35x compared to the prior approaches.","[Heinz, Carsten; Koch, Andreas] Tech Univ Darmstadt, Embedded Syst & Applicat Grp, Darmstadt, Germany",Technical University of Darmstadt,"Heinz, C (corresponding author), Tech Univ Darmstadt, Embedded Syst & Applicat Grp, Darmstadt, Germany.",heinz@esa.tu-darmstadt.de; koch@esa.tu-darmstadt.de,,"Heinz, Carsten/0000-0001-5927-4426",German Federal Ministry for Education and Research (BMBF) [01 IS 17091 B.],German Federal Ministry for Education and Research (BMBF)(Federal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF)),This research was funded by the German Federal Ministry for Education and Research (BMBF) in project 01 IS 17091 B.,,18,1,1,0,0,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",1939-8018,1939-8115,,J SIGNAL PROCESS SYS,J.

The affordability and flexibility of this equipment opens the door to a wide range of research possibilities, offering a cost-effective solution for battery performance analysis.","[Jimenez-Romero, F.

Further development in this area is coupling open source electronics with 3-D printable mechanical components to make fully functional distributedly-manufactured mechatronic tools for science. One research area where such low-cost technology is needed is to characterize thin film anti-reflective coatings and transparent conducting oxides (TCOs) for the glass, mirror and solar photovoltaic industry whose transmission properties are angle dependent. To meet this research need a low-cost 3-D printable open source dual axis gimbal system is presented in this study. An Arduino based microcontroller is used to move the sample holder to the user specified angle where two stepper motors control the motion providing two degrees of freedom. The sample holder is made in such a way that samples can easily be mounted on it by two movable latches. The system was validated and characterized for: i) unidirectional accuracy, ii) repeatability, iii) backlash, iv) speed resolution and v) microstep size. Finally, the mechatronic system is tested for the intended application using a halogen light source and a spectrometer to measure transmission through glass TCO samples through a hemisphere. The system performed as expected has a unidirectional accuracy of 2.827 degrees, repeatability of 1.585 degrees, backlash error of 1.237 degrees, maximum speed of 35.156 degrees and a verifiable microstep size of 0.33 degrees. Despite the highest mean squared errors, the open source gimbal system performed adequately while measuring transmission of radiation through glass with TCO coatings. This open source system also represents a 96% cost in savings as compared to the least expensive commercial variant. The high mean squared errors are offset by the cost of the system coupled with its open source nature that promotes further collaboration and hence, development.","[Bihari, Nupur; Pearce, Joshua M.] Michigan Technol Univ, Dept Mat Sci & Engn, 601 M&M Bldg, Houghton, MI 49931 USA; [Dash, Smruti Prasad; Pearce, Joshua M.] Michigan Technol Univ, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, Houghton, MI 49931 USA; [Dhankani, Karankumar C.] Michigan Technol Univ, Dept Mech Engn Engn Mech, Houghton, MI 49931 USA; [Pearce, Joshua M.] Aalto Univ, Sch Elect Engn, Dept Elect & Nanoengn, FI-02150 Espoo, Finland",Michigan Technological University; Michigan Technological University; Michigan Technological University; Aalto University,"Pearce, JM (corresponding author), Michigan Technol Univ, Dept Mat Sci & Engn, 601 M&M Bldg, Houghton, MI 49931 USA.",pearce@mtu.edu,"Pearce, Joshua/D-2052-2010","Pearce, Joshua/0000-0001-9802-3056",MOST lab; Fulbright Finland,MOST lab; Fulbright Finland,This work was supported by the MOST lab and Fulbright Finland.,,94,4,4,0,28,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",0957-4158,,,MECHATRONICS,Mechatronics,DEC,2018,56,,,,,,175,187,,10.1016/j.mechatronics.2018.07.005,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.mechatronics.2018.07.005,,,13,"Automation & Control Systems; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Engineering, Mechanical; Robotics",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Automation & Control Systems; Engineering; Robotics,HF6XT,,Green Submitted,,,2024-08-15,WOS:000454382300016,,,,580

The same principle can be applied to scanning angle interference microscopy (SAIM), where precision control of the scanned laser beam presents unique technical challenges for the builders of custom azimuthal scanning microscopes. Accurate synchronization between the instrument computer, beam scanning system and excitation source is required to collect high quality data and minimize sample damage in SAIM acquisitions. Drawing inspiration from open-source prototyping systems, like the Arduino microcontroller boards, we developed a new instrument control platform to be affordable, easily programmed, and broadly useful, but with integrated, precision analog circuitry and optimized firmware routines tailored to advanced microscopy. We show how the integration of waveform generation, multiplexed analog outputs, and native hardware triggers into a single central hub provides a versatile platform for performing fast circle-scanning acquisitions, including azimuthal scanning SAIM and multiangle TIRF. We also demonstrate how the low communication latency of our hardware platform can reduce image intensity and reconstruction artifacts arising from synchronization errors produced by software control. Our complete platform, including hardware design, firmware, API, and software, is available online for community-based development and collaboration.","[Colville, Marshall J.; Park, Sangwoo; Zipfel, Warren R.; Paszek, Matthew J.] Cornell Univ, Field Biophys, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA; [Zipfel, Warren R.] Cornell Univ, Nancy E & Peter C Meinig Sch Biomed Engn, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA; [Paszek, Matthew J.] Cornell Univ, Robert Frederick Smith Sch Chem & Biomol Engn, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA; [Paszek, Matthew J.] Cornell Univ, Field Biomed Engn, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA; [Zipfel, Warren R.; Paszek, Matthew J.] Kavli Inst Cornell Nanoscale Sci, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA",Cornell University; Cornell University; Cornell University; Cornell University,"Colville, MJ; Paszek, MJ (corresponding author), Cornell Univ, Field Biophys, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA.; Paszek, MJ (corresponding author), Cornell Univ, Robert Frederick Smith Sch Chem & Biomol Engn, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA.; Paszek, MJ (corresponding author), Cornell Univ, Field Biomed Engn, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA.; Paszek, MJ (corresponding author), Kavli Inst Cornell Nanoscale Sci, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA.",mjc449@cornell.edu; mjp31@cornell.edu,,"Colville, Marshall/0000-0002-5397-8382; Park, Sangwoo/0000-0002-2701-3114","National Institute of General Medical Sciences Ruth L.

To this end, measuring, data acquisition, and storage, as well as remote online visualization of real-time information, must be performed using suitable equipment. An experimental SMG is being deployed that combines photovoltaics and the energy carrier hydrogen through the interconnection of photovoltaic panels, electrolyser, fuel cell, and load around a voltage bus powered by a lithium battery. This paper presents a monitoring system based on open-source hardware and software for tracking the temperature of the photovoltaic generator in such an SMG. In fact, the increases in temperature in PV modules lead to a decrease in their efficiency, so this parameter needs to be measured in order to monitor and evaluate the operation. Specifically, the developed monitoring system consists of a network of digital temperature sensors connected to an Arduino microcontroller, which feeds the acquired data to a Raspberry Pi microcomputer. The latter is accessed by a cloud-enabled user/operator interface implemented in Grafana. The monitoring system is expounded and experimental results are reported to validate the proposal.","[Maria Portalo, Jose; Gonzalez, Isaias; Jose Calderon, Antonio] Univ Extremadura, Dept Elect Engn Elect & Automat, Ave Elvas S-N, Badajoz 06006, Spain",Universidad de Extremadura,"González, I (corresponding author), Univ Extremadura, Dept Elect Engn Elect & Automat, Ave Elvas S-N, Badajoz 06006, Spain.",jportalo@alumnos.unex.es; igonzp@unex.es; ajcalde@unex.es,"González, Isaías/Y-7300-2018; Calderon Godoy, Antonio Jose/R-4094-2019","González, Isaías/0000-0001-5645-3832; Calderon Godoy, Antonio Jose/0000-0003-2094-209X",European Regional Development Funds FEDER; Junta de Extremadura [IB18041],European Regional Development Funds FEDER(European Union (EU)); Junta de Extremadura,Project co-financed by European Regional Development Funds FEDER and by the Junta de Extremadura (IB18041).,,46,24,24,2,4,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2071-1050,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,AUG,2021,13,15,,,,,,,8182,10.3390/su13158182,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su13158182,,,23,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,TW4AH,,gold,,,2024-08-15,WOS:000682344600001,,,,582

Here, we present OptoPi, an open source, affordable (- & POUND;600), behavioural arena with accompanying multi-animal tracking soft-ware. The system features highly customisable and reproducible visible and infrared illu-mination and allows for optogenetic stimulation. OptoPi acquires images using a Raspberry Pi camera, features motorised LED-based illumination, Arduino control, as well as irradiance monitoring to fine-tune illumination conditions with real time feedback. Our open-source software (BioImageProcessing) can be used to simultaneously track multiple unmarked animals both in on-line and off-line modes. We demonstrate the functionality of OptoPi by recording and tracking under different illumination conditions the sponta-neous behaviour of larval zebrafish as well as adult Drosophila flies and their first instar lar-vae, an experimental animal that due to its small size and transparency has classically been hard to track. Further, we showcase OptoPi's optogenetic capabilities through a series of experiments using transgenic Drosophila larvae.& COPY; 2023 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Ltd.

The pressure accuracy, stability, and resolution are 0.09%, 0.02%, and 0.02% of the full span, respectively. The settling time to reach 2 bar from zero and stabilize is less than 2 s. Material for building a four-channel mu Pump (approx. $3000 USD) or an eight-channel mu Pump (approx. $5000 USD) is approximately a quarter, or a third of the cost of buying a high-end commercial system, respectively.

However, applying such stimuli simultaneously is difficult in practice. We aimed to design, build, test, and open-source describe a simple device that subjects a conventional mouse cage to independent cycles of physiologically relevant environmental variables. The device is based on a box enclosing the rodent cage to modify the light, feeding, and temperature environments. The device provides temperature-controlled air conditioning (heating or cooling) by a Peltier module and includes programmable feeding and illumination. All functions are set by a user-friendly front panel for independent cycle programming. Bench testing with a model simulating the CO2 production of mice in the cage showed: a) suitable air renewal (by measuring actual ambient CO2), b) controlled realistic illumination at the mouse enclosure (measured by a photometer), c) stable temperature control, and d) correct cycling of light, feeding, and temperature. The cost of all the supplies (retail purchased by e-commerce) was <300 US$. Detailed technical information is open-source provided, allowing for any user to reliably reproduce or modify the device. This approach can considerably facilitate circadian research since using one of the described low-cost devices for any mouse group with a given light-food-temperature paradigm allows for all the experiments to be performed simultaneously, thereby requiring no changes in the light/temperature of a general-use laboratory. 1 Introduction","[Farre, Ramon; Rodriguez-Lazaro, Miguel A.; Otero, Jorge; Gavara, Nuria; Sunyer, Raimon; Almendros, Isaac] Univ Barcelona, Sch Med & Hlth Sci, Unit Biophys & Bioengn, Barcelona, Spain; [Farre, Ramon; Otero, Jorge; Almendros, Isaac] Ciber Enfermedades Resp CIBERES, Barcelona, Spain; [Farre, Ramon; Almendros, Isaac] Inst Invest Biomed August Pi Sunyer IDIBAPS, Barcelona, Spain; [Otero, Jorge; Gavara, Nuria] Barcelona Inst Sci & Technol BIST, Inst Bioengn Catalonia IBEC, Barcelona, Spain; [Sunyer, Raimon] CIBER Bioingn Biomat & Nanomed CIBER BBN, Barcelona, Spain; [Farre, Nuria] Saolta Univ Healthcare Grp, Discipline Cardiol, Galway, Ireland; [Farre, Nuria] Univ Galway, Sch Med, Galway, Ireland; [Gozal, David] Marshall Univ, Joan C Edwards Sch Med, Off Dean, Huntington, WV USA",University of Barcelona; CIBER - Centro de Investigacion Biomedica en Red; CIBERES; University of Barcelona; Hospital Clinic de Barcelona; IDIBAPS; Barcelona Institute of Science & Technology; Institut de Bioenginyeria de Catalunya; University of Barcelona; CIBER - Centro de Investigacion Biomedica en Red; CIBERBBN; Ollscoil na Gaillimhe-University of Galway; Marshall University,"Farré, R (corresponding author), Univ Barcelona, Sch Med & Hlth Sci, Unit Biophys & Bioengn, Barcelona, Spain.; Farré, R (corresponding author), Ciber Enfermedades Resp CIBERES, Barcelona, Spain.; Farré, R (corresponding author), Inst Invest Biomed August Pi Sunyer IDIBAPS, Barcelona, Spain.",rfarre@ub.edu,,,,,,,34,0,0,0,0,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,LAUSANNE,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",,1664-042X,,FRONT PHYSIOL,Front.

This amplification is connected with the resonant frequency, which can be estimated applying the horizontal-to-vertical spectral ratio (1-1/V) method on seismic noise measurements. In this work, a low-cost user-friendly data acquisition system (Geophonino-3D) has been designed for three-component seismic noise recording. The developed system consists of the signal conditioning circuit and the Arduino Due with an SD Shield for data storage. The suitability of the equipment for the application of the H/V method has been first assessed in the laboratory, according to the experimental sensitivity, the internal noise stability and the channel consistency. Subsequently, experimental verification has been carried out by recording seismic noise at eight different sites along the province of Alicante (southeast Spain), with different soil characteristics. The performance of the developed acquisition system has been evaluated in terms of the power spectral density and the H/V peaks by comparison with the results obtained through a commercial seismic recorder. The obtained results show the applicability of the developed acquisition system to record seismic noise and to apply the H/V method.

As questions asked of behaviour and brain activity become more sophisticated, the ability to specify and run richly structured tasks becomes more important. An increasing focus on reproducibility also necessitates accurate communication of task logic to other researchers. To these ends, we developed pyControl, a system of open-source hardware and software for controlling behavioural experiments comprising a simple yet flexible Python-based syntax for specifying tasks as extended state machines, hardware modules for building behavioural setups, and a graphical user interface designed for efficiently running high-throughput experiments on many setups in parallel, all with extensive online documentation. These tools make it quicker, easier, and cheaper to implement rich behavioural tasks at scale. As important, pyControl facilitates communication and reproducibility of behavioural experiments through a highly readable task definition syntax and self-documenting features. Here, we outline the system's design and rationale, present validation experiments characterising system performance, and demonstrate example applications in freely moving and head-fixed mouse behaviour.","[Akam, Thomas; Walton, Mark E.] Univ Oxford, Dept Expt Psychol, Oxford, England; [Akam, Thomas; Costa, Rui M.] Champalimaud Ctr Unknown, Champalimaud Neurosci Program, Lisbon, Portugal; [Lustig, Andy] Howard Hughes Med Inst, Janelia Res Campus, Ashburn, VA USA; [Rowland, James M.; Panniello, Mariangela; Kohl, Michael M.] Univ Oxford, Dept Physiol Anat & Genet, Oxford, England; [Kapanaiah, Sampath K.

Widespread field testing for nitrate could begin to address the nitrate pollution problem, however, the Cadmium Reduction Method, the leading certified method to detect and quantify nitrate, demands the use of a toxic heavy metal. An alternative, the recently proposed Environmental Protection Agency Nitrate Reductase Nitrate-Nitrogen Analysis Method, eliminates this problem but requires an expensive proprietary spectrophotometer. The development of an inexpensive portable, handheld photometer will greatly expedite field nitrate analysis to combat pollution. To accomplish this goal, a methodology for the design, development, and technical validation of an improved open-source water testing platform capable of performing Nitrate Reductase Nitrate-Nitrogen Analysis Method. This approach is evaluated for its potential to i) eliminate the need for toxic chemicals in water testing for nitrate and nitrite, ii) reduce the cost of equipment to perform this method for measurement for water quality, and iii) make the method easier to carryout in the field. The device is able to perform as well as commercial proprietary systems for less than 15% of the cost for materials.

Most systems available to the public have price tags in the thousands of dollars and their dimensions cannot be easily customized. Current systems have a maximum length of about ten meters, and for a typical greenhouse application that length may not be sufficient. The price of the system increases with an increase in length, and with a base price in the thousands of dollars it becomes impractical to buy a system for such application. Our HyperRail is a modular linear motion system with a repeatability of 2 mm and current top speed of 200 mm/s. This is possible through a stepper motor driver that allows for 1/16th microstepping giving an average of 6180 steps per revolution. An advantage that this system has is its ability to increase or decrease the length of system with minimum effort and only nominal increase in price. The HyperRail can be mounted on a set of tripods or directly on the structure of a building such as a greenhouse. The base price for a three-meter system, on tripods is US$278 and only US$45 for each additional 1.5 m of length. (C) 2019 The Authors.

An affinity-based process using Watson-Crick interactions was developed that enables purification of DNA-tagged compounds from complex reaction mixtures. The purification relies on a single-stranded DNA-oligonucleotide, called capture strand, which was covalently coupled to an agarose matrix and to which a DNA-compound conjugate from a DNA-encoded library (DEL) reaction can be reversibly annealed to. The thus-formed DNA duplex tolerated surprisingly stringent washing conditions with multiple solvents to remove excess reactants and reagents. The tolerated solvents included aqueous buffers, aqueous EDTA solutions to remove metal ions, aqueous mixtures of organic solvents, and even pure organic solvents. The purified DNA-conjugate was eluted with aqueous ammonia and could be used for reaction analysis or for instance in DNA -encoded library synthesis.

To assess the potential of autonomous low-cost UAVs for the mapping and monitoring of alpine glaciers, we conducted multiple aerial surveys on the Kanderfirn in the Swiss Alps in 2017 and 2018 using open hardware and software of the Paparazzi UAV project. The open-source photogrammetry software OpenDroneMap was tested for the generation of high-resolution orthophotos and digital surface models (DSMs) from aerial imagery and cross-checked with the well-established proprietary software Pix4D. Accurately measured ground control points served for the determination of the geometric accuracy of the orthophotos and DSMs. A horizontal (xy) accuracy of 0.7-1.2 m and a vertical (z) accuracy of 0.7-2.1 m was achieved for OpenDroneMap, compared to a xy-accuracy of 0.3-0.5 m and a z-accuracy of 0.4-0.5 m obtained for Pix4D. Based on the analysis and comparison of different orthophotos and DSMs, surface elevation, roughness and brightness changes from 3 June to 29 September 2018 were quantified. While the brightness of the glacier surface decreased linearly over the ablation season, the surface roughness increased. The mean DSM-based elevation change across the glacier tongue was 8 m, overestimating the measured melting and surface lowering at the installed ablation stakes by about 1.5 m. The presented results highlight that self-built fixed-wing UAVs in tandem with open-source photogrammetry software are an affordable alternative to commercial remote-sensing platforms and proprietary software. The applied low-cost approach also provides great potential for other regions and geoscientific disciplines.","[Groos, Alexander R.; Bertschinger, Thalia J.; Kummer, Celine M.; Munz, Lukas] Univ Bern, Inst Geog, Hallerstr 12, CH-3012 Bern, Switzerland; [Erlwein, Sabrina] Tech Univ Munich, Chair Strateg Landscape Planning & Management, Emil Ramann Str 6, D-85354 Freising Weihenstephan, Germany; [Philipp, Andreas] Univ Augsburg, Inst Geog, Univ Str 10, D-86135 Augsburg, Germany",University of Bern; Technical University of Munich; University of Augsburg,"Groos, AR (corresponding author), Univ Bern, Inst Geog, Hallerstr 12, CH-3012 Bern, Switzerland.",alexander.groos@giub.unibe.ch,"Philipp, Andreas/B-1670-2009","Erlwein, Sabrina/0000-0002-7599-560X; Groos, Alexander Raphael/0000-0002-9379-0333",,,,,56,26,28,4,19,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2076-3263,,GEOSCIENCES,Geosciences,AUG,2019,9,8,,,,,,,356,10.3390/geosciences9080356,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/geosciences9080356,,,21,"Geosciences, Multidisciplinary",Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI),Geology,IT6KA,,"Green Published, Green Submitted, gold",,,2024-08-15,WOS:000482981000015,,,,592

The device, featuring a 1 ms sample acquisition time, utilizes a single interchangeable light emitting diode (LED) as a light source in combination with photodiode detectors and a Texas Instruments LaunchPad as the main control unit. An appropriately constructed flow cell can be connected to a flow reactor made out of transparent polymeric material such as perfluoroalkoxy (PFA) tubing. The flow cell can be moved to different positions of the tube in order to take measurements at different residence times without having to disassemble the photometer or the flow reactor system. The bespoke photometer was used to determine the residence time distribution (RTD) of various microreactors/micromixers, as well as for measuring the reaction rate constant for the base-induced hydrolysis of p-nitrophenol acetate in a biphasic segmented flow system. Owing to the 1 ms sample acquisition time of the novel device the lengths of individual segments can be measured in real time.","[Glotz, Gabriel; Kappe, C.

In order to monitor soil salinization in plant physiological experiments, a salinity monitoring system - SProb - was produced to improve our understanding of plant responses to salinity, using open hardware Arduino platform. An experiment was performed and designed to calibrate and check the viability and accuracy of SProb to be used in scientific researches. Salt concentrations were manipulated to identify sensor ability in determining salt accumulation or leaching in soils. Also, two mangrove plant species were grown to identify if root presence would affect soil salt measurements. The soil osmotic potential (psi(s)) was estimated from SProb results and correlated with predawn and midday leaf water potential (psi(l)) of the mangrove plants, to identify if psi(s) would affect plants water regulations. It was also shown that SProb described well the soil salt accumulation or leaching along the time, and the measurements were not affected by the presence of roots. The ranges of psi(s) matched with the range of mangrove psi(l), and the psi(l) decreased with the decrease in psi(s) (increase in salinity). It was confirmed that the SProb sensor is efficient, cheap and has enough accuracy to monitor soil salt concentration. Thus, SProb can be used in plant physiological experiments increasing our ability to make accurate science when such technology is not available in research centers.","[Negrao-Rodrigues, Vanessa] Museu Paraense Emilio Goeldi, Programa Posgrad Bot Trop, Belem, Para, Brazil; [Negrao-Rodrigues, Vanessa] Univ Fed Rural Amazonia, Belem, Para, Brazil; [Teodoro, Grazielle Sales] Univ Fed Para, Inst Ciencias Biol, Dept Biol, Belem, Para, Brazil; [Marques-Azevedo, Mario J.] Plantem Plant Technol & Environm Monitoring Ltd, Dept P&D, Sao Jose Dos Campos, Brazil; [Brum, Mauro] Univ Arizona, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Tucson, AZ USA",Museu Paraense Emilio Goeldi; Universidade Federal Rural da Amazonia (UFRA); Universidade Federal do Para; University of Arizona,"Negrao-Rodrigues, V (corresponding author), Museu Paraense Emilio Goeldi, Programa Posgrad Bot Trop, Belem, Para, Brazil.; Negrao-Rodrigues, V (corresponding author), Univ Fed Rural Amazonia, Belem, Para, Brazil.",vanessanegraorodrigues@gmail.com,"Teodoro, Grazielle S/K-2586-2014; Negrão-Rodrigues, Vanessa/JBS-3983-2023; Marques-Azevedo, Mario Jose/G-2389-2018","Teodoro, Grazielle S/0000-0002-5528-8828; Negrão-Rodrigues, Vanessa/0000-0003-0400-9152; Marques-Azevedo, Mario Jose/0000-0002-1868-5306",Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior - Brazil (CAPES) [001]; National Science Foundation (NSF) award [175483],Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior - Brazil (CAPES)(Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES)); National Science Foundation (NSF) award(National Science Foundation (NSF)),VNR was supported with a master scholarship by CoordenacAo de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior - Brazil (CAPES) - Finance Code 001.

The instrument agitates and illuminates microalgae suspensions grown inside flasks. It was optimized for low production cost, simplicity, low power consumption, design flexibility, consistent, and controllable growth light intensity. The illuminated orbital shaker is especially well suited for low-resource research laboratories and education. It is an alternative to commercial instruments for microalgae cultivation. It improves on typical do-it-yourself microalgae growth systems by offering consistent and well characterized illumination light intensity. The illuminated growth area is 20 cm x 15 cm, which is suitable for three T75 tissue culture flasks or six 100 ml Erlenmeyer flasks. The photosynthetic photon flux density, is variable in eight steps (26 - 800 mu mol.m(-2).s(-1)) and programmable in a 24-h light/dark cycle. The agitation speed is variable (0 - 210 RPM). The overall material cost is around 300 pound, including an entry-level orbital shaker. The build takes two days, requiring electronics and mechanical assembly capabilities. The instrument build is documented in a set of open-source protocols, design files, and source code. The design can be readily modified, scaled, and adapted for other orbital shakers and specific experimental requirements. The instrument function was validated by growing fresh-water microalgae Desmodesmus quadricauda and Chlorella vulgaris. The cultivation protocols, microalgae growth curves, and doubling times are included in this report. (C) 2020 The Authors.

The total construction cost for this rover is less than USD 3000, approximately one-tenth the cost of existing platforms, and it can be built using facilities frequently available at academic institutions (machine shop, 3-D printer, open-source hardware and software). Instrumentation deployed on this rover can be customized; the rover presented in this study was equipped with a dual-frequency GPS receiver and a digital SLR camera for constructing digital elevation models using structure-from-motion (SfM) photogrammetry. We deployed this prototype rover on the Northeast Greenland Ice Stream to map local variations in snow accumulation and surface topography. The rover conducted four autonomous missions based out of the East Greenland Ice-Core Project (EastGRIP) camp during July 2017, measuring surface elevation transects across the hazardous ice-stream shear margins. During these missions, the rover proved capable of driving over 20 km on a single charge with a drawbar pull of 250 N, sufficient to tow instrumentation of up to 100 kg. The rover also acquired photographs that were subsequently used to construct digital elevation models of a site monitored for spatiotemporal variability in snow accumulation, demonstrating adequate stability for high-resolution imaging applications. Due to its low cost, low-power requirements, and simple modular design, mass deployments of this rover design are practicable. Operation of the rover in hazardous areas circumvents the substantial expense and risk to personnel associated with conventional, crewed deployments. Thus, this rover is an investigatory plat-form that enables direct exploration of polar environments considered too hazardous for conventional field expeditions.","[Hoffman, Andrew O.; Hvidberg, Christine] Univ Copenhagen, Ctr Ice & Climate, Niels Bohr Inst, Juliane Maries Vej 30, DK-2100 Copenhagen, Denmark; [Steen-Larsen, Hans Christian] Univ Bergen, Geophys Inst, Bergen, Norway; [Steen-Larsen, Hans Christian] Bjerknes Ctr Climate Res, Bergen, Norway; [Hoffman, Andrew O.; Christianson, Knut] Univ Washington, Dept Earth & Space Sci, Seattle, WA 98195 USA",University of Copenhagen; Niels Bohr Institute; University of Bergen; Bjerknes Centre for Climate Research; University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle,"Hoffman, AO (corresponding author), Univ Copenhagen, Ctr Ice & Climate, Niels Bohr Inst, Juliane Maries Vej 30, DK-2100 Copenhagen, Denmark.; Hoffman, AO (corresponding author), Univ Washington, Dept Earth & Space Sci, Seattle, WA 98195 USA.",hoffmaao@uw.edu,"Steen-Larsen, Hans Christian/F-9927-2013; Hvidberg, Christine S./E-8934-2015","Hvidberg, Christine S./0000-0002-9665-1339","VILLUM FONDEN [2361, 16572]; Denmark (A.

While in-line particle holography (PH) can provide high-resolution measurements of particles, it suffers from speckle noise. Plenoptic imaging (PI) is less susceptible to speckle noises, but it involves a trade-off between spatial and angular resolution, rendering images with low resolution. Here, we report a simple microscopy setup with the goals of getting the strengths of both techniques. It is built with off-the-shelf and cost-effective components including a photographic lens, a diaphragm, and a CCD camera. The cost of the microscopy setup is affordable to small labs and individual researchers. The pupil plane of the proposed setup can be mechanically accessible, allowing us to implement pupil plane modulation and increase the depth of field (DOF) without requiring any additional relay lenses. It also allows us to understand the working principle of pupil plane modulation clearly, benefiting microscopy education. It illuminates the sample (particles) using diffuse white light, and thus avoids the problem of speckle noise. It captures multiple perspective images via pupil plane modulation, without requiring trading off angular and spatial resolution. We validate the setup with 2D and 3D particle samples.

However, it is already known that shared memory is vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks since mechanisms to check integrity or authenticate callers for the shared memory payload are not supported in TrustZone. While an encryption-based method that resolves this limitation does exist, there are some architectural limitations. Indeed, even with key protection countermeasures applied, there is a risk that encryption keys may be leaked, as they are placed in insecure user memory during communication. Moreover, countermeasures for key leakage cause system performance overhead. In this paper, we propose a lightweight and secure scheme for shared memory, called Software One-Time Programmable Memory (SOTPM). SOTPM is a software-implemented, one-time programmable shared memory. It is based on the idea that payload encryption in the shared memory layer is unnecessary because sensitive data is already encrypted in the application layer before being written to the shared memory. SOTPM is set to read-only after data is written into SOTPM due to the one-time programmable characteristic. Therefore, attackers are unable to manipulate content in SOTPM during communication. Since it is not necessary for SOTPM to encrypt the payload in order to prevent malicious payload manipulation, it is possible to remove the risk of key leakage posed in previous studies. Additionally, in contrast with the existing method, our method can dramatically reduce system performance overhead. We implemented our prototype on an open-source hardware board with an Armv8-A processor and performed a security analysis and performance evaluation. The results show that SOTPM provides a sufficient level of security and less than 1% performance overhead, implying that SOTPM is a reasonable solution for current commercial products.","[Shim, Dongwook; Lee, Dong Hoon] Korea Univ, Grad Sch Informat Secur, Seoul 02841, South Korea",Korea University,"Lee, DH (corresponding author), Korea Univ, Grad Sch Informat Secur, Seoul 02841, South Korea.",donghlee@korea.ac.kr,,"Shim, Dongwook/0000-0003-4615-9546",Korea University Grant,Korea University Grant,This work was supported by the Korea University Grant.,,45,2,3,1,7,IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC,PISCATAWAY,"445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA",2169-3536,,,IEEE ACCESS,IEEE Access,,2021,9,,,,,,4490,4504,,10.1109/ACCESS.2020.3047813,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2020.3047813,,,15,"Computer Science, Information Systems; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Telecommunications",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Computer Science; Engineering; Telecommunications,PS0ZU,,gold,,,2024-08-15,WOS:000607661300001,,,,601

Output voltages, corresponding to typical behaviors on the captive HS, such as stopping (A), rolling (B), flapping (C), and sliding (D), are clearly obtained, and their analytical interpretation on captured electrical signals are fully validated via a comparison study with consecutively captured images for each motion of the HS.

With few exceptions, such test systems are discontinuous. They require exposure of the biological test material in small units, such as multiwell plates, during prolonged incubation periods, and do not allow online read-outs. It is mostly due to these shortcomings that applications in continuous monitoring of, e.g., drinking or surface water quality are largely missing. We propose the use of pipetting robots that can be used to automatically exchange samples in multiwell plates with fresh samples in a semi-static manner, as a potential solution to overcome these limitations. In this study, we developed a simple and low-cost, versatile pipetting robot constructed partly using open source hardware that has a small footprint and can be used for online monitoring of water quality by means of an automated whole-organism bioassay. We tested its precision in automated 2-fold dilution series and used it for exposure of zebrafish embryos (Danio rerio) a common model species in ecotoxicology to cadmium chloride and permethrin. We found that, compared to conventional static or semi-static exposure scenarios, effects of the two chemicals in zebrafish embryos generally occurred at lower concentrations, and analytically verified that the increased frequency of media exchange resulted in a greater availability of the chemical. In combination with advanced detection systems this custom-made pipetting robot has the potential to become a valuable tool in future monitoring strategies for drinking and surface water.","[Steffens, Sebastian; Nuesser, Leonie; Seiler, Thomas-Benjamin; Hollert, Henner; Brinkmann, Markus] Rhein Westfal TH Aachen, Dept Ecosyst Anal, Inst Environm Res, ABBt Aachen Biol & Biotechnol, Aachen, Germany; [Ruchter, Nadine; Schumann, Mark] Univ Duisburg Essen, Aquat Ecol & Ctr Water & Environm Res ZWU, Essen, Germany; [Doering, Ricarda; Cofalla, Catrina; Schuettrumpf, Holger] Rhein Westfal TH Aachen, Inst Hydraul Engn & Water Resources Management, Aachen, Germany; [Ostfeld, Avi] Technion Israel Inst Technol, Environm Water & Agr Engn, Fac Civil & Environm Engn, Haifa, Israel; [Salomons, Elad] OptiWater, Haifa, Israel; [Hollert, Henner] Nanjing Univ, Sch Environm, State Key Lab Pollut Control & Resource Reuse, Nanjing, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Hollert, Henner] Chongqing Univ, Coll Resources & Environm Sci, Chongqing, Peoples R China; [Hollert, Henner] Tongji Univ, Key Lab Yangtze Water Environm, Minist Educ, Shanghai, Peoples R China; [Brinkmann, Markus] Univ Saskatchewan, Sch Environm & Sustainabil, Saskatoon, SK, Canada",RWTH Aachen University; University of Duisburg Essen; RWTH Aachen University; Technion Israel Institute of Technology; Nanjing University; Chongqing University; Tongji University; University of Saskatchewan,"Brinkmann, M (corresponding author), Univ Saskatchewan, Sch Environm & Sustainabil, Saskatoon, SK, Canada.",markus.brinkmann@usask.ca,"Mueller, Leonie Katharina/KGL-3411-2024; Hollert, Henner/A-1027-2009; Schüttrumpf, Holger/B-1177-2010; Brinkmann, Markus/L-3879-2013","Mueller, Leonie Katharina/0000-0003-4323-9129; Hollert, Henner/0000-0001-5776-5619; Schüttrumpf, Holger/0000-0002-0104-0499; Bruell, Catrina/0000-0003-0079-4093; Seiler, Thomas-Benjamin/0000-0001-8127-510X; Salomons, Elad/0000-0002-1522-1805; Brinkmann, Markus/0000-0002-4985-263X; Ostfeld, Avi/0000-0001-9112-6079","German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF); Ministry of Science, Technology and Space (MOST), Israel; SOLUTIONS project from the European Union's Seventh Framework Programme [603437]; German National Academic Foundation ('Studienstiftung des deutschen Volkes'); OptiWater","German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF)(Federal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF)); Ministry of Science, Technology and Space (MOST), Israel(Ministry of Science, Technology and Space (MOST), Israel); SOLUTIONS project from the European Union's Seventh Framework Programme(European Union (EU)); German National Academic Foundation ('Studienstiftung des deutschen Volkes'); OptiWater","The present study was conducted as part of the project W3-Hydro ""Water Quality Event Detection for Urban Water Security and Urban Water Management Based on Hydrotoxicological Investigations"" within the Joint Germanlsraeli Water Technology Research Program that received funds from the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) and the Ministry of Science, Technology and Space (MOST), Israel.

However, the systems for detecting the fluorophores remain expensive and thus inaccessible to many. Most commercial systems are often only optimized for one specific application, making reuse difficult. This paper demonstrates, characterizes and evaluates an inexpensive and versatile system for the detection of fluorophores with two wavelengths using high power LEDs. The LEDs are arranged in two banks angled downward at a tray in a way that allows for bright and uniform illumination while preventing direct reflections into the camera. The emitted light is filtered through an exchangeable filter frame and can be detected using the camera of a smartphone or similar device. By using filters both in front of the LEDs and the camera, very low background and using sufficient exposure times, very high sensitivity can be achieved. The two wavelengths of excitation light and the exchangeable filters allow for optimization for the specific fluorophore used and thus highest brightness.& COPY; 2023 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Additionally, the increasing development of precision or smart agriculture makes it necessary to improve the measurement systems while widely distributing them at the location of crops. For these reasons, in this work, the design, construction and fabrication of an adaptable autonomous solar-powered climatic station with wireless 3G or WiFi communication is presented. The station measures relative humidity, temperature, atmospheric pressure, precipitation, wind speed, and light radiation. In addition, the system monitors the charge state of the main battery and the energy generated by the photovoltaic module to act as a reference cell for solar energy generation capability and agrivoltaic potential in the installation area. The station can be remotely controlled and reconfigured. The collected data from all sensors can be uploaded to the cloud in realtime.

Although specifically designed for active textiles, the characterization device is broadly applicable for studying the performance of actuators including but not limited to Shape Memory Alloy (SMA) wires, SMA springs, and electroactive polymers. The characterization device may be operated in several modes that enable a wide variety of experimental protocols to be automated. These modes include but are not limited to automatic displacement and displacement rate mode, automatic force mode, and manual displacement mode. For active textiles that actuate by electrical stimulus or by resistive heating, the electronic system has five independent motor drivers. For each driver, the voltage drop across its outputs and current are measured, enabling the measurement of textile power consumption and other electrical properties. The validation of the Active Textile Characterization Device uses a contractile SMA knitted textile actuated by four motor drivers through resistive heating. Several protocols were successfully conducted to demonstrate the experimental flexibility of the system. During these experiments, knit length, knit tension, current through the knit, voltage drop across the knit, and room temperature were measured with respect to time. (C) 2019 The Authors.

In addition, with the goal of realizing real-time tasks in the software system such as synchronizing motion control and on-off control, the real-time Win 2000 system is adopted. As a device driver for PMAC and PCL, a user graphical interface and a numerical control program interpretation module are also designed. This system is helpful to solve complicated problems in designing numerical controls for ATL such as ensuring high requirements for precise machine control and synchronization of motion control and on-off control.","[Liu Lin; Li Yong; Wen Liwei; Xiao Jun] Nanjing Univ Aeronaut & Astronaut, Coll Mat Sci & Technol, Nanjing 210016, Peoples R China",Nanjing University of Aeronautics & Astronautics,"Xiao, J (corresponding author), Nanjing Univ Aeronaut & Astronaut, Coll Mat Sci & Technol, Nanjing 210016, Peoples R China.",j.xiao@nuaa.edu.cn,,,National High-Tech Research and Development Program Special Foundation of China [2002AA334130],National High-Tech Research and Development Program Special Foundation of China,Foundation item: National High-Tech Research and Development Program Special Foundation of China (2002AA334130),,12,3,6,2,19,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"360 PARK AVE SOUTH, NEW YORK, NY 10010-1710 USA",1000-9361,,,CHINESE J AERONAUT,Chin.

The horizontal-to-vertical spectral ratio technique calculates the resonant frequency of the soil just by using a single three-component sensor. Array measurements require at least several vertical sensors registering simultaneously and their analysis provides an estimation of the surface waves dispersion curve. Although these methods are relatively cheaper than other geotechnical techniques, the cost of the sensors and the multi-channel data acquisition system means that small research groups cannot afford this kind of equipment. In this work, two prototypes for registering seismic noise have been developed and implemented: a three-channel acquisition system, optimized for working with three-component sensors; and a twelve-channel acquisition system, prepared for working simultaneously with twelve vertical geophones. Both prototypes are characterized by being open-hardware, open-software, easy to implement, and low-cost. The main aim is to provide a data acquisition system that can be reproduced and applied by any research group. Both developed prototypes have been tested and compared with other commercial equipment, showing their suitability to register seismic noise and to estimate the soil characteristics.","[Luis Soler-Llorens, Juan; Juan Giner-Caturla, Jose] Univ Alicante, Dept Earth Sci & Environm, Crta San Vicente Raspeig S-N, E-03080 Alicante, Spain; [Jose Galiana-Merino, Juan; Youcef Nassim-Benabdeloued, Boualem; Ortiz Zamora, Javier] Univ Alicante, Dept Phys Syst Engn & Signal Theory, Crta San Vicente Raspeig S-N, E-03080 Alicante, Spain; [Jose Galiana-Merino, Juan; Rosa-Cintas, Sergio; Juan Giner-Caturla, Jose] Univ Alicante, Univ Inst Phys Appl Sci & Technol, Crta San Vicente Raspeig S-N, E-03080 Alicante, Spain; [Rosa-Cintas, Sergio] Univ Alicante, Fac Educ, Dept Gen Didact & Specif Didact, Crta San Vicente Raspeig S-N, E-03080 Alicante, Spain; [Youcef Nassim-Benabdeloued, Boualem] Univ Politecn Cataluna, Dept Fluid Mech, C Jordi Girona 31, Barcelona 08034, Spain",Universitat d'Alacant; Universitat d'Alacant; Universitat d'Alacant; Universitat d'Alacant; Universitat Politecnica de Catalunya,"Soler-Llorens, JL (corresponding author), Univ Alicante, Dept Earth Sci & Environm, Crta San Vicente Raspeig S-N, E-03080 Alicante, Spain.",jl.soler@ua.es; juanjo@dfists.ua.es; boualem.youcef.nassim.benabdel@upc.edu; sergio.rosacintas@ua.es; javier.ortiz@ua.es; jj.giner@ua.es,"Llorens, Juan Luis Soler/Y-9106-2019; Soler-Llorens, Juan Luis/I-7379-2016; GALIANA-MERINO, JUAN JOSE/L-1948-2014","Llorens, Juan Luis Soler/0000-0003-4540-8790; Soler-Llorens, Juan Luis/0000-0003-4540-8790; GALIANA-MERINO, JUAN JOSE/0000-0002-0818-2836; Benabdeloued, Boualem Youcef Nassim/0000-0001-7657-616X","Ministerio de Economia, Industria y Competitividad [CGL2016-77688-R]; Spanish MINECO under project EPILATES [CGL2015.65602-R]; European funds under project EPILATES [CGL2015.65602-R]; Regional Government of Comunidad Valenciana (Spain) [AICO/2016/098]","Ministerio de Economia, Industria y Competitividad; Spanish MINECO under project EPILATES; European funds under project EPILATES; Regional Government of Comunidad Valenciana (Spain)","This research was funded by the Ministerio de Economia, Industria y Competitividad (grant number CGL2016-77688-R AEI/FEDER, UE); Spanish MINECO and European funds under project EPILATES (grant number CGL2015.65602-R); and Regional Government of Comunidad Valenciana (Spain) (grant number AICO/2016/098).",,53,10,11,1,12,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2079-9292,,ELECTRONICS-SWITZ,Electronics,SEP,2019,8,9,,,,,,,1035,10.3390/electronics8091035,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/electronics8091035,,,21,"Computer Science, Information Systems; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Physics, Applied",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Computer Science; Engineering; Physics,JC2TC,,"Green Published, gold",,,2024-08-15,WOS:000489128400122,,,,610

A small-scale autonomous pontoon boat has been built, equipped with the open-hardware flight controller, GPS receiver, Inertial Measurement Units (IMU) and the magnetometer. A 2(3) factorial design based on Design of Experiment (DOE) is carried out to study the influence of three parameters (turn_rate, turn_angle and damping) on the response variable (peak-to-peak deviation from the desired trajectory). Total 24 experiments have been conducted by setting the desired trajectory as a circle with diameter 20 m. The peak-to-peak deviation in each experiment has been observed. The analyses revealed that the damping has low interaction with the turn angle and turn rate while there is a stronger interaction between the turn angle and turn rate. And the peak-to-peak deviation of the trajectory tends to decrease when the parameter damping was set to high value. The regression model has been derived and plotted as a response surface. The optimized parameters were selected from the plot and perform the experiment with three replications. The results confirm that parameters tuning has improved the performance of the boat significantly. With the DOE approach, the impact of two or more parameters on a response, the interaction between parameters can be investigated systematically. This approach is an effective way to tuning the parameters and can be applied to various kinds of the autonomous vehicle.","[Thianwiboon, Mongkol] Mahidol Univ, Fac Engn, Dept Ind Engn, Nakhon Pathom 73170, Thailand",Mahidol University,"Thianwiboon, M (corresponding author), Mahidol Univ, Fac Engn, Dept Ind Engn, Nakhon Pathom 73170, Thailand.",mongkol.thi@mahidol.ac.th,,,,,,,34,2,2,0,0,"CHULALONGKORN UNIV, FAC ENGINEERING",BANGKOK,"254 PHAYATHAI RD, PATHUMWAN, BANGKOK, 10330, THAILAND",0125-8281,,,ENG J-THAIL,Eng.

A number of IoT-based home monitoring systems have been available, but most rely on privacy-intrusive cameras. With more and more concerns on privacy and security of human data, anomaly detection based on nonintrusive IoT devices becomes more desirable. Considering the elderly consumers, a low-cost system with good detection accuracy is further critical for the system's acceptability by elderly users. We propose a smart home monitoring system for living-alone senior citizens, relying on carefully designed, low-cost infrared sensor devices, as well as a cloud-based data processing and anomaly detection platform. Our PIR sensor device is effective in continuous monitoring of motion data in a user's apartment, and an open-hardware software platform is devised to support sensors manufactured by various vendors in the IoT system, all for cost reduction purpose. For privacy preservation, we encrypt collected data and store data indices in a blockchain system, to achieve efficient data access control and auditing. For motion anomaly detection, we propose a simple but effective environment adaptation method to work with the one-class support vector machine (OCSVM) method. Experiments driven by real-world traces show good reliability, accuracy, and efficiency of our system.","[Fang, Le; Wu, Chuan; Yu, Yizhou] Univ Hong Kong, Dept Comp Sci, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Wu, Yu] Southern Univ Sci & Technol, Inst Future Networks, Shenzhen 518055, Peoples R China; [Wu, Yu; Wu, Chuan] PCL Res Ctr Networks & Commun, Peng Cheng Lab, Shenzhen 518066, Peoples R China",University of Hong Kong; Southern University of Science & Technology; Peng Cheng Laboratory,"Wu, C (corresponding author), Univ Hong Kong, Dept Comp Sci, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.",lefang@connect.hku.hk; wuy7@sustech.edu.cn; cwu@cs.hku.hk; yzyu@cs.hku.hk,"Fang, Le/AAI-5592-2021; Fang, Le/IWD-9835-2023; Gopal, Suvetha/KFR-7088-2024; Wu, Chuan/E-9919-2010; /F-3345-2010","Fang, Le/0000-0003-1860-4008; Fang, Le/0000-0003-1860-4008; Wu, Chuan/0000-0002-3144-4398; /0000-0002-0470-5548","Hong Kong RGC [HKU 17204619, 17225516, C5026-18G]; Hong Kong ITF [ITS/305/19FP]; NSFC [61702098]; PCL Future Greater-Bay Area Network Facilities for Large-scale Experiments and Applications [LZC0019]",Hong Kong RGC(Hong Kong Research Grants Council); Hong Kong ITF; NSFC(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); PCL Future Greater-Bay Area Network Facilities for Large-scale Experiments and Applications,"This work was supported in part by the Hong Kong RGC under Contract HKU 17204619, Contract 17225516, and Contract C5026-18G (CRF); in part by the Hong Kong ITF under Grant ITS/305/19FP; in part by NSFC under Grant 61702098; and in part by the PCL Future Greater-Bay Area Network Facilities for Large-scale Experiments and Applications under Grant LZC0019.",,73,11,12,6,39,IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC,PISCATAWAY,"445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA",2327-4662,,,IEEE INTERNET THINGS,IEEE Internet Things J.,Feb 15,2021,8,4,,,,,2603,2614,,10.1109/JIOT.2020.3019270,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/JIOT.2020.3019270,,,12,"Computer Science, Information Systems; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Telecommunications",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Computer Science; Engineering; Telecommunications,QE6LK,,,,,2024-08-15,WOS:000616317000039,,,,612

It is shown theoretically and by simulation that the output power level and efficiency decrease with the increase of the transistor on-resistance. The transistor biasing condition for achieving near-zero temperature dependence is derived. With this, a dynamic biasing technique is proposed to stabilize the output power of the PA over a wide temperature range. A prototype class-E PA was designed and fabricated in a 0.18-mu m CMOS process. Operating at 477 MHz, the PA has 4 output stages and the measured maximum output variation is about +/- 0.3 dB from -40 degrees C to 85 degrees C. This measurement has a good agreement with the theoretical analysis and simulation.","[Liu, Chang; Shi, C-J Richard] Univ Washington, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, Seattle, WA 98195 USA",University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle,"Liu, C (corresponding author), Univ Washington, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, Seattle, WA 98195 USA.",chgliu@ieee.org; cjshi@uw.edu,,"Liu, Chang/0000-0002-5432-6095",Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL); Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) Push Open Source Hardware (POSH) program [FA8650-18-2-7857],Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL)(United States Department of DefenseUS Air Force Research Laboratory); Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) Push Open Source Hardware (POSH) program,This work was supported in part by the Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) and Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) Push Open Source Hardware (POSH) program under Grant FA8650-18-2-7857.,,9,8,8,0,4,IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC,PISCATAWAY,"445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA",1549-7747,1558-3791,,IEEE T CIRCUITS-II,IEEE Trans.

An inexpensive electrochemical workstation could thus prove useful in educational labs, and increase access to electrochemistry-based analytical techniques for food, drug and environmental monitoring. With these motivations in mind, we describe here the CheapStat, an inexpensive (<$80), open-source (software and hardware), hand-held potentiostat that can be constructed by anyone who is proficient at assembling circuits. This device supports a number of potential waveforms necessary to perform cyclic, square wave, linear sweep and anodic stripping voltammetry.

Yet, global plastics production has quadrupled in 40 years and only 9 % has been recycled. If these trends continue, carbon emis-sions from plastic wastes would reach 15 % of global carbon budgets by 2050. An approach to reducing plastic waste is to use distributed recycling for additive manufacturing (DRAM) where virgin plastic products are replaced by locally manufactured recycled plastic products that have no transportation-related carbon emissions. Unfortunately, the design of most 3-D printers forces an increase in the machine cost to expand for recycling plastic at scale. Recently, a fused granular fabrication (FGF)/fused particle fabrication (FPF) large-scale prin-ter was demonstrated with a GigabotX extruder based on the open source cable driven Hangprinter concept. To further improve that system, here a lower-cost recyclebot direct waste plastic extruder is demonstrated and the full designs, assembly and operation are detailed. The <$1,700 machine's accuracy and printing performance are quantified, and the printed parts mechanical strength is within the range of other systems. Along with sup-port from the Hangprinter and DUET3 communities, open hardware developers have a rich ecosystem to modify in order to print directly from waste plastic for DRAM.(c) 2023 The Author(s).

However, many individuals with hearing loss are dissatisfied with the quality of modern hearing aids. Amplification is the main method of compensating for hearing loss in modern hearing aids. One common amplification technique is dynamic range compression, which maps audio signals onto a person's hearing range using an amplification curve. However, due to the frequency dependent nature of the human cochlea, compression is often performed independently in different frequency bands. This paper presents a real-time multirate multiband amplification system for hearing aids, which includes a multirate channelizer for separating an audio signal into eleven standard audiometric frequency bands, and an automatic gain control system for accurate control of the steady state and dynamic behavior of audio compression as specified by ANSI standards. The spectral channelizer offers high frequency resolution with low latency of 5.4 ms and about 14x improvement in complexity over a baseline design. Our automatic gain control includes a closed-form solution for satisfying any designated attack and release times for any desired compression parameters. The increased frequency resolution and precise gain adjustment allow our system to more accurately fulfill audiometric hearing aid prescriptions.","[Sokolova, Alice; Hunt, Martin; Harris, Fredric] Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Sokolova, Alice; Aksanli, Baris] San Diego State Univ, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, San Diego, CA 92182 USA; [Sengupta, Dhiman; Gupta, Rajesh] Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Comp Sci & Engn, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Gupta, Rajesh] Halicioglu Data Sci Inst, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Garudadri, Harinath] Univ Calif San Diego, Qualcomm Inst Calit2, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA",University of California System; University of California San Diego; California State University System; San Diego State University; University of California System; University of California San Diego; University of California System; University of California San Diego,"Sokolova, A (corresponding author), Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA.; Sokolova, A (corresponding author), San Diego State Univ, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, San Diego, CA 92182 USA.",aasokolo@ucsd.edu,,"Sokolova, Alice/0000-0001-5862-0374; Aksanli, Baris/0000-0001-6347-9061","National Institute of Health, NIH/National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders (NIDCD) [R21DC015046, R33DC015046]; National Institute of Health, NIH/NIDCD [R01DC015436]; Division of Information and Intelligent Systems, University of California San Diego [IIS-1838897]; Qualcomm Institute, University of California San Diego (UCSD); Halicioglu Data Science Institute, UCSD; Wrethinking, the Foundation","National Institute of Health, NIH/National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders (NIDCD); National Institute of Health, NIH/NIDCD(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute on Deafness & Other Communication Disorders (NIDCD)); Division of Information and Intelligent Systems, University of California San Diego; Qualcomm Institute, University of California San Diego (UCSD); Halicioglu Data Science Institute, UCSD; Wrethinking, the Foundation","This work was supported in part by the National Institute of Health, NIH/National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders (NIDCD), under Grant R21DC015046 and Grant R33DC015046 (Self-~tting of Ampli~cation: Methodology and Candidacy); in part by the National Institute of Health, NIH/NIDCD, under Grant R01DC015436 (A Real-time, Open, Portable, Extensible Speech Laboratory); in part by the Division of Information and Intelligent Systems, University of California San Diego, under Grant IIS-1838897 (A Framework for Optimizing Hearing Aids In Situ Based on Patient Feedback, Auditory Context, and Audiologist Input); in part by the Qualcomm Institute, University of California San Diego (UCSD); in part by the Hal~c~o lu Data Science Institute, UCSD; and in part by the Wrethinking, the Foundation.",,26,3,5,1,2,IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC,PISCATAWAY,"445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA",2169-3536,,,IEEE ACCESS,IEEE Access,,2022,10,,,,,,54301,54312,,10.1109/ACCESS.2022.3176368,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2022.3176368,,,12,"Computer Science, Information Systems; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Telecommunications",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Computer Science; Engineering; Telecommunications,1N6RP,37309510.0,"Green Submitted, gold, Green Accepted",,,2024-08-15,WOS:000800780700001,,,,618

Peer-production and contribution cultures are enfolded in a dynamic of resistance and appropriation in relation to capitalism. Open-source and contribution-based cultural processes have been critiqued as tending towards bureaucracy or becoming enfolded in a never-ending neoliberal imaginary from which escape or transcendence become impossible. An examination of the values expressed within a peer-production community challenges these perspectives and shows how ""operational pragmatics"" can provide moral justifications through reference to matters of principle and matters of design. Conflating these matters complicates claims about the inherent virtues of participation, especially in technical cultures. A qualitative analysis of an open-source hardware project shows how competing moral justifications unfold, and how the challenges that they pose to capitalism may be tenuous or temporary because of the way that justificatory regimes work within technology development under capitalism.","[Powell, Alison B.] London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, Dept Media & Commun, London, England",University of London; London School Economics & Political Science,"Powell, AB (corresponding author), London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, Dept Media & Commun, London, England.",a.powell@lse.ac.uk,,"Powell, Alison/0000-0001-5780-9132",,,,,32,5,5,0,4,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",1753-9129,1753-9137,,COMMUN CULT CRIT,Commun.

Depending on the number of samples to be analyzed, conventional processing of each FFPE block separately can be laborious or impracticable. This effort can be drastically reduced by using tissue microarrays (TMAs). TMAs have a wide range of applications and can be considered as a high-throughput method to process up to hundreds of miniaturized tissue samples simultaneously on a single microscopy slide, in order to reduce labor, costs and sample consumption, and to increase results comparability. Several commercial and self-made solutions to fabricate TMAs with varying degrees of automation are available. However, these solutions may not be suitable for every situation, either due to high costs, high complexity, lack of precision or lack of flexibility, especially when diagnostically oriented pathology institutes or laboratories with constrained resources are considered. This article introduces the TMA-Mate, an open-source 3D printable modular toolkit for constructing high-density TMAs of arbitrary layouts, providing an affordable, lightweight, and accessible procedure to implement TMAs into existing histology processing pipelines.

Here, we propose detectability of scale-freeness as a benchmark to evaluate time-series extraction settings. Scale-freeness, i.e., power-law distribution of node connections, is a fundamental topological property that is highly conserved across biological networks, and as such needs to be manifest within plausible reconstructions of brain connectivity. We demonstrate that scale-free network topology only emerges when adequately fine cortical parcellations are adopted alongside an appropriate correlation threshold, and provide the full design of the first open-source hardware platform to accelerate the calculation of large linear regression arrays.

In this paper, we describe a new wireless controller that is adapted to liquid manipulation tasks, in particular when combined with the proposed 3D-printed pumps. It can be built from widely available electronic components and managed with open-source software. The use of peristaltic pumps enables to move volumes from milliliters to liters with a relative error below 1% or a syringe pump capable of injecting volumes in the range of milliliters with microliter accuracy. The system is remotely controllable over WiFi and easily automated using the MQTT communication protocol. The programming of the microcontroller is performed on the Arduino IDE. The WiFi settings and the calibration value can be easily modified, stored and exported in the form of a JSON file to create a user friendly, plug and play and easily scalable device. Additional sensors or actuators can be added, allowing the system to adapt to various usages. Finally, in addition to its low manufacturing cost and its capability to fit a large variety of tasks involving liquid handling, our system has been specifically designed for research environments where adaptability and repeatability of experiments is essential.

Because of its efficiency and speed of analysis, capillary electrophoresis (CE) is a prospective method for the monitoring of a flow composition withdrawn from various processes (e.g., occurring in bioreactors, fermentations, enzymatic assays, and microdialysis samples). However, interfacing CE to a various flow of interest requires further study. In this paper, several ingenious approaches on interfacing flow from various chemical or bioprocesses to a capillary electrophoresis instrument are reviewed. Most of these interfaces can be described as computer-controlled autosamplers. Even though most of the described interfaces waste too many samples, many interesting and important applications of the devices are reported. However, the lack of commercially available devices prevents the wide application of CE for flow analysis. On the contrary, this fact opens up a potential avenue for future research in the field of flow sampling by CE.","[Kaljurand, Mihkel; Saar-Reismaa, Piret; Vaher, Merike; Gorbatsova, Jelena; Mazina-Sinkar, Jekaterina] Tallinn Univ Technol, Inst Chem & Biotechnol, Fac Sci, EE-19089 Tallinn, Estonia",Tallinn University of Technology,"Kaljurand, M (corresponding author), Tallinn Univ Technol, Inst Chem & Biotechnol, Fac Sci, EE-19089 Tallinn, Estonia.",mihkel@chemnet.ee; piret.saar1@taltech.ee; merike.vaher@taltech.ee; jelenagorbatsova@gmail.com; jekaterina.mazina@taltech.ee,/U-7550-2017,"/0000-0002-2430-0097; Vaher, Merike/0000-0002-3818-1906; Gorbatsova, Jelena/0000-0002-5903-6337","Estonian Ministry of Education and Research [IUT 3320, EAG14]; SA Archimedes (""Development of additional analytical capabilities for Estonian Center of Analytical Chemistry"" (AKKI))","Estonian Ministry of Education and Research(Ministry of Education and Research, Estonia); SA Archimedes (""Development of additional analytical capabilities for Estonian Center of Analytical Chemistry"" (AKKI))","This research was funded by the Estonian Ministry of Education and Research (grant numbers IUT 3320 and EAG14) and SA Archimedes (""Development of additional analytical capabilities for Estonian Center of Analytical Chemistry"" (AKKI)).",,32,6,7,1,24,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,1420-3049,,MOLECULES,Molecules,AUG,2021,26,16,,,,,,,4918,10.3390/molecules26164918,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/molecules26164918,,,12,"Biochemistry & Molecular Biology; Chemistry, Multidisciplinary",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Biochemistry & Molecular Biology; Chemistry,UH8GS,34443507.0,"Green Published, gold",,,2024-08-15,WOS:000690162600001,,,,625

However, commercially available devices are unaffordable to most potential users in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), limiting access to many patients who could benefit from this treatment. This study aimed to design and test a cheap and easy-to-build negative pressure device and provide its detailed open-source description, thereby enabling free replication. Methods: the negative pressure device was built using off-the-shelf materials available via e-commerce and was based on a small pump, a pressure transducer, and the simplest Arduino controller with a digital display (total retail cost <= 75 US$). The device allows the user to set any therapeutic range of intermittent negative pressure and has two independent safety mechanisms. The performance of the low-cost device was carefully tested on the bench using a phantom wound, producing a realistic exudate flow rate. Results: the device generates the pressure patterns set by the user (25-175 mmHg of vacuum pressure, 0-60 min periods) and can drain exudate flows within the clinical range (up to 1 L/h). Conclusions: a novel, low-cost, easy-to-build negative pressure device for wound healing displays excellent technical performance. The open-source hardware description provided here, which allows for free replication and use in LMICs, will facilitate the application and wider utilization of this therapy to patients.","[Farre, Ramon; Rodriguez-Lazaro, Miguel A.; Otero, Jorge] Univ Barcelona, Fac Med & Ciencies Salut, Unitat Biofis & Bioengn, Barcelona 08036, Spain; [Farre, Ramon; Otero, Jorge] CIBER Enfermedades Resp, Madrid 28029, Spain; [Farre, Ramon; Castro, Pedro; Compta, Yaroslau] Inst Investigac Biomed August Pi Sunyer, Barcelona 08036, Spain; [Gonzalez-Martin, Julian] Univ Barcelona, ISGlobal, Hosp Clin, Microbiol Dept,CDB, Barcelona 08036, Spain; [Gonzalez-Martin, Julian] Inst Salud Carlos III, CIBER Infect Dis CIBERINFEC, Madrid 28029, Spain; [Castro, Pedro; Hospital, Teresa] Hosp Clin Barcelona, Internal Med Dept, Intens Care Unit, Barcelona 08036, Spain; [Compta, Yaroslau] Hosp Clin Barcelona, Inst Neurociencies, Serv Neurol, Parkinsons Dis & Movement Disorders Unit, Barcelona 08036, Spain; [Compta, Yaroslau] Univ Barcelona, Maeztu Ctr, Inst Neurociencies, Barcelona 08036, Spain; [Solana, Gorka] Univ Save, Fac Engenharias & Tecnol, Maxixe, Mozambique; [Gozal, David] Univ Missouri, Sch Med, Dept Child Hlth, Columbia, MO 65212 USA",University of Barcelona; CIBER - Centro de Investigacion Biomedica en Red; CIBERES; University of Barcelona; Hospital Clinic de Barcelona; IDIBAPS; University of Barcelona; Hospital Clinic de Barcelona; ISGlobal; Instituto de Salud Carlos III; University of Barcelona; Hospital Clinic de Barcelona; University of Barcelona; Hospital Clinic de Barcelona; University of Barcelona; University of Missouri System; University of Missouri Columbia,"Farré, R (corresponding author), Univ Barcelona, Fac Med & Ciencies Salut, Unitat Biofis & Bioengn, Barcelona 08036, Spain.; Farré, R (corresponding author), CIBER Enfermedades Resp, Madrid 28029, Spain.; Farré, R (corresponding author), Inst Investigac Biomed August Pi Sunyer, Barcelona 08036, Spain.",rfarre@ub.edu,"Castro, Pedro/AAF-4792-2021; Castro, Pedro/AAG-2513-2021; Gonzalez-Martin, Julian/AGS-6795-2022; Farre, Ramon/L-2664-2017","Castro, Pedro/0000-0002-6118-8970; Castro, Pedro/0000-0002-6118-8970; Gonzalez-Martin, Julian/0000-0001-7248-6706; Gozal, David/0000-0001-8195-6036; Farre, Ramon/0000-0002-9084-7824; Solana Arteche, Gorka/0000-0002-1212-0574",,,,,38,2,2,0,2,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2077-0383,,J CLIN MED,J.

For controller synthesis, we show a mathematical model of the ball and plate system and explain the kinematics analysis of the Stewart platform. We design a sliding mode controller that includes error integration, which makes the system robust against external disturbances. We describe the results of the simulations and the experiments and then illustrate the advantage of the applied sliding mode control compared to LQ control.

The platform is modular, affordable, easy to build and open source. Additional modules presented here include cameras for monitoring eye movements, visual virtual reality, and a micro-manipulator for positioning various probes for recording or optical interference. We demonstrate the utility of the platform by recording eye movements and showing the robust activation of head-direction cells. This novel experimental apparatus combines the advantages of head fixation and intact vestibular activity in the horizontal plane. The open-loop mode can be used to study e.g., vestibular sensory representation and processing, while the closed-loop mode allows animals to navigate in rotational space, providing a better substrate for 2-D navigation in virtual environments.

Even though low-cost sensors emerged a few decades ago, versatile and cheap electronics like Arduino could give stormwater researchers a new opportunity to build their own monitoring systems to support their work. To find out sensors which are ready for low-cost stormwater monitoring systems, for the first time, we review the performance assessments of low-cost sensors for monitoring air humidity, wind speed, solar radiation, rainfall, water level, water flow, soil moisture, water pH, conductivity, turbidity, nitrogen, and phosphorus in a unified metrological framework considering numerous parameters. In general, as these low-cost sensors are not initially designed for scientific monitoring, there is extra work to make them suitable for in situ monitoring, to calibrate them, to validate their performance, and to connect them with open-source hardware for data transmission. We, therefore, call for international cooperation to develop uniform low-cost sensor production, interface, performance, calibration and system design, installation, and data validation guides which will greatly regulate and facilitate the sharing of experience and knowledge.","[Zhu, Qingchuan; Cherqui, Frederic; Bertrand-Krajewski, Jean-Luc] Univ Lyon, INSA Lyon, DEEP, EA7429, F-69621 Villeurbanne, France; [Cherqui, Frederic] Univ Lyon, Univ Claude Bernard Lyon 1, F-69622 Villeurbanne, France",Institut National des Sciences Appliquees de Lyon - INSA Lyon; Universite Claude Bernard Lyon 1,"Zhu, QC (corresponding author), Univ Lyon, INSA Lyon, DEEP, EA7429, F-69621 Villeurbanne, France.",qingchuan.zhu@insa-lyon.fr,"Cherqui, Frederic/AAJ-5281-2020","Cherqui, Frederic/0000-0001-8836-3970",European Union [786566]; Rhone-Mediterranee-Corse Water Agency under the Cheap'Eau project - China Scholarship Council [201806560056]; Rhpne-Mediterranee-Corse Water Agency under the Cheap' Eau project; China Scholarship Council [201806560056]; Marie Curie Actions (MSCA) [786566] Funding Source: Marie Curie Actions (MSCA),European Union(European Union (EU)); Rhone-Mediterranee-Corse Water Agency under the Cheap'Eau project - China Scholarship Council; Rhpne-Mediterranee-Corse Water Agency under the Cheap' Eau project; China Scholarship Council(China Scholarship Council); Marie Curie Actions (MSCA)(Marie Curie Actions),"This research received financial support from the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under Grant Agreement no. 786566 (https://mind4stormwater.org), and from the Rhpne-Mediterranee-Corse Water Agency under the Cheap' Eau project.

IVSP presents the design of a networked system for joint rate control and error control of video over resource-constrained embedded devices. First, a combination of two different congestion indicators is introduced to differentiate between congestion levels and handle them accordingly. Second, a feedback-based rate controller is developed to maximize received video quality, in which sensor nodes can adaptively adjust their sending rates. Finally, a different retransmission mechanism for different packets is proposed. Lost packets can be stored temporarily and resend when free channel is available to avoid congestion. The core component of IVSP is an open source hardware platform, which is based on Raspberry Pi sensor nodes. IVSP is extensively evaluated on 7 Raspberry Pi sensor nodes.

Calibration of the tracker position and orientation is a fundamental task to correct systematic errors. This article explores the effect of metallic distortion on the open hardware Anser EMT system and describes a newly developed approach for volume calibration of the magnetic field model. The technique is also applied to effectively map the field in the presence of magnetic shields that can be used to reduce electromagnetic distortions passively. Unlike calibration techniques commonly found in literature, which aim to correct the tracking position error, our method can reconstruct an analytical magnetic field model starting from a reduced amount of scattered data. This way, a faster convergence of the solver algorithm is obtained, and EMT position and orientation errors are inherently corrected. The new modeling technique was applied to generate a new, undistorted magnetic field model for Anser EMT, to demonstrate the effectiveness of passive shielding, and to compensate for the distortion introduced by a commercial fluoroscopy C-arm.

However, combining 2P imaging with spectrally arbitrary light stimulation can be challenging due to crosstalk between stimulation light and fluorescence detection. To overcome this limitation, we present a simple and low-cost electronic solution based on an ESP32 microcontroller and a TLC5947 LED driver to rapidly time-interleave stimulation and detection epochs during scans. Implemented for less than $100, our design can independently drive up to 24 arbitrary spectrum LEDs to meet user requirements. We demonstrate the utility of our stimulator for colour vision experiments on the in vivo tetrachromatic zebrafish retina and for optogenetic circuit mapping in Drosophila. (C) 2020 The Authors.

The dependability of the Internet of Things is critical because the services will be concerned with real life. However, the inexpensive hardware provides limited resources for communication. In this paper, we present exact all-terminal reliability of the wireless networks of which the number of links of each node is bounded. First, we analyze the all-terminal reliability of the regular wireless network, where any two nodes are connected by a wireless link consisting of a pair of radio modules. The reliability polynomial is derived from the Tutte polynomial that is the seminal work of the algebraic graph theory. Second, we analyze the all-terminal reliability of the wireless network including the random mesh network under the assumption that if the module fails, all radio links connected through a radio module are cut off. We consider both the fault of the communication module and the fading of the wireless channel in the indoor channel condition. For improving the reliability, we also propose a fault-tolerant method giving redundant radio modules into each node. We also analyze cost-effectiveness. We also calculate the mean-time-to-failure (MTTF) for wireless networks. We show that the random mesh network of which each node includes three or more the radio-broadcast modules is more dependable than any other regular network of which each node comprises four point-to-point modules if it is the connected graph in the static environment.","[Park, Jae-Hyun] Chung Ang Univ, Sch Comp Sci & Engn, Seoul 156756, South Korea",Chung Ang University,"Park, JH (corresponding author), Chung Ang Univ, Sch Comp Sci & Engn, Seoul 156756, South Korea.",hyunie@cau.ac.kr,"Park, Jae-Hyun/R-6013-2017","Park, Jae-Hyun/0000-0003-2616-9907",,,,,23,16,16,0,11,IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC,PISCATAWAY,"445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA",2327-4662,,,IEEE INTERNET THINGS,IEEE Internet Things J.,APR,2016,3,2,,,,,219,230,,10.1109/JIOT.2015.2496259,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/JIOT.2015.2496259,,,12,"Computer Science, Information Systems; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Telecommunications",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Computer Science; Engineering; Telecommunications,DH9XH,,,,,2024-08-15,WOS:000373148800008,,,,635

Many industries have shifted to vacuum drying as cost- or time-saving measures. Small-scale vacuum drying, however, has been limited by the high costs of specialty scientific tools. To make vacuum drying more accessible, this study provides design and performance information for a small-scale open source vacuum oven, which can be fabricated from off-the-shelf and 3-D printed components. The oven is tested for drying speed and effectiveness on both waste plastic polyethylene terephthalate (PET) and a consortium of bacteria developed for bioprocessing of terephthalate wastes to assist in distributed recycling of PET for both additive manufacturing as well as potential food. Both materials can be damaged when exposed to high temperatures, making vacuum drying a desirable solution. The results showed that the open source vacuum oven was effective at drying both plastic and biomaterials, drying at a higher rate than a hot-air dryer for small samples or for low volumes of water. The system can be constructed for less than 20% of commercial vacuum dryer costs for several laboratory-scale applications, including dehydration of bio-organisms, drying plastic for distributed recycling and additive manufacturing, and chemical processing.","[Hubbard, Benjamin R.] Michigan Technol Univ, Dept Mech Engn Engn Mech, Houghton, MI 49931 USA; [Putman, Lindsay, I; Techtmann, Stephen] Michigan Technol Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Houghton, MI 49931 USA; [Pearce, Joshua M.] Michigan Technol Univ, Dept Mat Sci & Engn, Houghton, MI 49931 USA; [Pearce, Joshua M.] Michigan Technol Univ, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, Houghton, MI 49931 USA; [Pearce, Joshua M.] Univ Lorraine, Equipe Rech Proc Innovatifs ERPI, F-54010 Nancy, France",Michigan Technological University; Michigan Technological University; Michigan Technological University; Michigan Technological University; Universite de Lorraine,"Pearce, JM (corresponding author), Michigan Technol Univ, Dept Mat Sci & Engn, Houghton, MI 49931 USA.; Pearce, JM (corresponding author), Michigan Technol Univ, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, Houghton, MI 49931 USA.; Pearce, JM (corresponding author), Univ Lorraine, Equipe Rech Proc Innovatifs ERPI, F-54010 Nancy, France.",brhubbar@mtu.edu; liputman@mtu.edu; smtechtm@mtu.edu; pearce@mtu.edu,"; Pearce, Joshua/C-9240-2013","Putman, Lindsay/0000-0001-5175-9373; Hubbard, Benjamin/0000-0002-7614-5332; Pearce, Joshua/0000-0001-9802-3056",Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency ReSource program [HR00112020033]; NSF SBIR Phase II [1746480]; Witte Endowment; Directorate For Engineering [1746480] Funding Source: National Science Foundation; Div Of Industrial Innovation & Partnersh [1746480] Funding Source: National Science Foundation,Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency ReSource program; NSF SBIR Phase II(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Engineering (ENG)); Witte Endowment; Directorate For Engineering(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Engineering (ENG)); Div Of Industrial Innovation & Partnersh(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Engineering (ENG)),"Funding for this work was provided by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency ReSource program cooperative agreement HR00112020033, the NSF SBIR Phase II grant number: 1746480, and theWitte Endowment.

Accurate liquid handling is an essential operation in the context of chemical laboratories, and consequently a self-driving laboratory will require robotic liquid handling and transfer. Although many pipettes are available for human scientists, robots cannot manipulate these pipettes due to the limitations of current robot gripper morphology. We propose an intuitive yet elegant design for a 3D-printed digital pipette designed for robots to carry out chemical experiments. It costs less than 200 USD, and the simple design with three parts enables a new user to assemble one in 10 minutes. We conducted a performance evaluation that closely followed ISO 8655-6. Our results show that robots with the digital pipette could conduct accurate liquid delivery with 0.2% random error for the nominal volume (10 mL). This performance is comparable to commercially available liquid handling devices, whose typical random errors are 0.3%. We propose an economical 3D-printed pipette, which aims to overcome the limitations of two-finger robot grippers. It enables general-purpose robot arms to achieve high precision in liquid transfer tasks that is comparable to commercial devices.","[Yoshikawa, Naruki; Darvish, Kourosh; Vakili, Mohammad Ghazi; Garg, Animesh; Aspuru-Guzik, Alan] Univ Toronto, Toronto, ON M5S 1A1, Canada; [Yoshikawa, Naruki; Darvish, Kourosh; Garg, Animesh; Aspuru-Guzik, Alan] Vector Inst Artificial Intelligence, Toronto, ON M5G 1M1, Canada; [Aspuru-Guzik, Alan] Canadian Inst Adv Res CIFAR, Toronto, ON M5G 1M1, Canada",University of Toronto; Vector Institute for Artificial Intelligence; Canadian Institute for Advanced Research (CIFAR),"Yoshikawa, N; Garg, A; Aspuru-Guzik, A (corresponding author), Univ Toronto, Toronto, ON M5S 1A1, Canada.; Yoshikawa, N; Garg, A; Aspuru-Guzik, A (corresponding author), Vector Inst Artificial Intelligence, Toronto, ON M5G 1M1, Canada.; Aspuru-Guzik, A (corresponding author), Canadian Inst Adv Res CIFAR, Toronto, ON M5G 1M1, Canada.",naruki.yoshikawa@mail.utoronto.ca; garg@cs.toronto.edu; alan@aspuru.com,"Garg, Animesh/AGK-2223-2022; Aspuru-Guzik, Alan/A-4984-2008","Garg, Animesh/0000-0003-0482-4296; Aspuru-Guzik, Alan/0000-0002-8277-4434; Yoshikawa, Naruki/0000-0003-1546-8709; Ghazi Vakili, mohammad/0000-0002-2927-4975; Darvish, Kourosh/0000-0003-4984-432X",Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada [IRCPJ 547644-18]; NSERC-Google Industrial Research Chair Award,Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada(Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)CGIAR); NSERC-Google Industrial Research Chair Award,"We thank the Acceleration Consortium for financial support, Sebastian Arellano-Rubach and Kevin Angers for helping with graphics, and Florian Shkurti for the useful discussions.

To address this, we introduce OpenCell, an economical, open-source, 3-in-1 laboratory device that combines the functionalities of a bead homogenizer, a microcentrifuge, and a vortex mixer. OpenCell utilizes modular attachments that magnetically connect to a central rotating brushless motor. This motor couples to an epicyclic gearing mechanism, enabling efficient bead homogenization, vortex mixing, and centrifugation within one compact unit. OpenCell's design incorporates multiple redundant safety features, ensuring both the device's and operator's safety. Additional features such as RPM measurement, programmable timers, battery operation, and optional speed control make OpenCell a reliable and reproducible laboratory instrument. In our study, OpenCell successfully isolated DNA from Spinacia oleracea (spinach), with an average yield of 2.3 mu g and an A260/A280 ratio of 1.77, demonstrating its effectiveness for downstream applications such as Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) amplification. With its compact size (20 cm x 28 cm x 6.7 cm) and lightweight design (0.8 kg), comparable to the size and weight of a laptop, OpenCell is portable, making it an attractive component of a 'lab-in-a-backpack' for resource-constrained environments in low-and-middle-income countries and synthetic biology in remote field stations. Leveraging the accessibility of 3D printing and off-the-shelf components, OpenCell can be manufactured and assembled at a low unit cost of less than $50, providing an affordable alternative to expensive laboratory equipment costing over $4000.

The superior-inferior movement required to simulate tumour motion during a normal breathing cycle was achieved via the novel use of an Arduino Uno (TM), a low-cost open-source microcontroller board connected to a high torque servo motor. Slow CT imaging was used to acquire the image set and a 4D cone beam CT (4D-CBCT) verified the efficacy of contoured margins before treatment on the moving phantom. Treatment fields were delivered to a section of a CIRS (TM) anthropomorphic phantom. Dose verification to the dynamic phantom with Gafchromic EBT3 film using 3 %-1 mm gamma analysis acceptance criteria registered an absolute dose pass rate for IMRT and VMAT of 98 and 96.6 %, respectively. It was verified that 100 % of the PTV received the prescribed dose of 12 Gy per fraction using the dynamic phantom, and no major discrepancy between planned and measured results due to interplay between multileaf collimator sequences and target motion was observed. This study confirmed that the use of an in-house solution using open source hardware and software with existing quality assurance equipment was appropriate in validating a new treatment technique.","[Munoz, Luis; Ziebell, Amy; Morton, Jason; Bhat, Madhava] Adelaide Radiotherapy Ctr, Genesis Canc Care, 352 South Terrace, Adelaide, SA 5000, Australia",,"Munoz, L (corresponding author), Adelaide Radiotherapy Ctr, Genesis Canc Care, 352 South Terrace, Adelaide, SA 5000, Australia.",luis.munoz@adradcentre.com.au,,,Genesiscare,Genesiscare,"I would like to acknowledge Genesiscare for their funding support, and thank Thulani Nyathi, Christopher Colyer and David Willis for help revising the manuscript.",,33,3,3,0,5,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0158-9938,1879-5447,,AUSTRALAS PHYS ENG S,Australas.

In most of the low-budget mammalian cell study laboratories, highly skilled laboratory personnel should determine microscopic changes in microplate well media by taking the microplate outside the incubator and by imaging each well medium under a microscope, with the risk of contamination and reliability degrading. An alternative solution is to use an in-incubator operated live-cell imaging device, which, however, cannot be afforded by low-cost laboratories. In this paper, we present the design, realization, and test stages of a microplate compatible inverted bright-field microscope system that can be used in incubators. The developed system enables real-time and long-term in-incubator imaging of any user-selectable microplate type. The device can capture bright-field microscopic images by using a low-cost CMOS image sensor, an inverted varifocal CCTV lens and an array of light emitting diodes. In addition, by developed two-axial movement stage and image augmenting algorithms, the whole area of a user selectable well (e.g. area of a 6.5 mm diameter well in a 96-well plate) can be automatically imaged without using any other third party software. The long-term performance of the system is tested in incubators with human embryonic kidney and breast cancer cell lines.","[Gurkan, Guray] Istanbul Kultur Univ, Elect & Elect Engn Dept, Atakoy Campus, TR-34156 Istanbul, Turkey; [Gurkan, Koray] Istanbul Univ Cerrahpasa, Elect & Elect Engn Dept, Avcilar Campus, TR-34320 Istanbul, Turkey",Istanbul Kultur University; Istanbul University - Cerrahpasa,"Gürkan, G (corresponding author), Istanbul Kultur Univ, Elect & Elect Engn Dept, Atakoy Campus, TR-34156 Istanbul, Turkey.",g.gurkan@iku.edu.tr,"Gurkan, Guray/P-8671-2019; Gürkan, Koray/AAE-3254-2020","Gurkan, Guray/0000-0003-0109-1349; Gürkan, Koray/0000-0003-2283-8173",,,,,21,10,11,0,6,IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC,PISCATAWAY,"445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA",2169-3536,,,IEEE ACCESS,IEEE Access,,2019,7,,,,,,58764,58779,,10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2914958,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2914958,,,16,"Computer Science, Information Systems; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Telecommunications",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Computer Science; Engineering; Telecommunications,HZ3ZH,,gold,,,2024-08-15,WOS:000468786400001,,,,643

This study analyzes the economic impacts of a theoretical international agreement that eliminates patent rights for any nuclear aggressor (i.e., free global compulsory licensing of all intellectual property (IP) for a nuclear aggressor). The results found that all but one of the nuclear states would have a significant economic disincentive to start a nuclear attack if the proposal was put into force. Payback times ranged from 1.2 to 40 years, where the entire GDP of a nuclear aggressor would be needed to offset the loss for aggression, indicate such a mechanism as a whole would be an effective nuclear deterrent. This method would not be universally effective without ensuring all nuclear states are members of the international economy and IP processes. With the growth of open-source products and reduced value of patents, this mechanism does have a limited effectiveness time. Currently it appears to be a policy trajectory worthy of future work that can enhance safety from nuclear threat without causing harm to countries of goodwill.","[Pearce, Joshua M.] Western Univ, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, London, ON N6A 5B9, Canada; [Pearce, Joshua M.] Western Univ, Ivey Business Sch, London, ON N6A 5B9, Canada",Western University (University of Western Ontario); Western University (University of Western Ontario),"Pearce, JM (corresponding author), Western Univ, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, London, ON N6A 5B9, Canada.; Pearce, JM (corresponding author), Western Univ, Ivey Business Sch, London, ON N6A 5B9, Canada.",joshua.pearce@uwo.ca,"Pearce, Joshua/C-9240-2013","Pearce, Joshua/0000-0001-9802-3056",Thompson Endowment; Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada,Thompson Endowment; Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada(Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)CGIAR),This research was funded by the Thompson Endowment and the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada.,,130,0,0,0,0,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2313-576X,,SAFETY,Safety,SEP,2022,8,3,,,,,,,55,10.3390/safety8030055,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/safety8030055,,,12,"Public, Environmental & Occupational Health",Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI),"Public, Environmental & Occupational Health",4S9HY,,gold,,,2024-08-15,WOS:000857743700001,,,,646

High-resolution anatomical and functional studies of the brain require artifact-free images that are acquired with a highly sensitive radiofrequency (RF) coil. New Method: The animal holder plays an important role in mitigating image artifacts: motion artifacts are reduced by immobilizing the animal and geometric-distortion artifacts are reduced by accurately positioning the animal to improve static-field shimming. The RF coil, in turn, must provide high sensitivity over the whole brain and not physically interfere with the animal holder. To accomplish these tasks, the animal holder and RF coil should be designed in tandem. In this manuscript, animal holders and RF coils for mice, rats, and marmoset monkeys are described. Each animal holder includes components for anesthesia delivery and animal immobilization, as well as a compatible receive coil. Results/Comparison with Existing Method(s): Animal holders were capable of accurate and reproducible positioning (for the marmoset, this was in the stereotactic plane), consequently reducing geometric distortion in echo-planar images. Ear bars were designed in conjunction with receive-coil formers, thereby maximizing the sensitive region of coils, while concurrently reducing motion to less than a pixel over EPI time series. Motion and SNR were quantified to facilitate direct comparison to existing animal holders and RF coils. All computer-aided-design (CAD) files of animal holders and RF coils are provided to promote dissemination. Conclusions: The confluence of design between the animal holder and RF coil provides a pragmatic solution for routine imaging of small animals.","[Gilbert, Kyle M.; Schaeffer, David J.; Gati, Joseph S.; Klassen, L.

A smartphone Bluetooth Android interface was also created to circumvent the use of a computer. We demonstrated that our scheme is suitable for measurements in classical electrochemical conditions but also to carry out experiments with ultramicroelectrodes. We could thus reach a noise resolution of less than 1 pA. Scan rates of 8000 Vs-1 with ohmic drop compensation were also achieved.

These nodes can be deployed over much longer distances through multihop relay topologies. Furthermore, we evaluate the efficacy of our system toward supporting multimedia data transmission and even attempt multimedia streaming through our deployed underwater IoT network using video compression and reduced sampling of the video frames.

Blinkies are made up of a central processing unit connected to two microphones and a few light-emitting devices, are powered by a battery, and protected by a robust enclosure. Distributed in space and combined with a conventional video camera, they allow to practically sense sound power over a very large area without hassle. We give a comprehensive overview of the proposed system and its potential applications. We describe the hardware design and trade-offs made. We provide a model for the channel between sound power measurements and signal acquired by the video camera. Because each sensor is potentially affected by a different attenuation due to the channel, we propose a calibration procedure to restore the scale of the measurements. The effectiveness of the calibration is validated in an experiment. Finally, we demonstrate sound source localization using a hundred-and-one actual Blinkies in highly reverberent environment.","[Scheibler, Robin; Ono, Nobutaka] Tokyo Metropolitan Univ, Grad Sch Syst Design, Tokyo 1910065, Japan",Tokyo Metropolitan University,"Scheibler, R (corresponding author), Tokyo Metropolitan Univ, Grad Sch Syst Design, Tokyo 1910065, Japan.",robin.scheibler@ieee.org,"Scheibler, Robin/AAI-6912-2021","Ono, Nobutaka/0000-0003-4242-2773",JSPS Postdoctoral Fellowship [17F17049]; SECOM Science and Technology Foundation; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [17F17049] Funding Source: KAKEN,"JSPS Postdoctoral Fellowship(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of Science); SECOM Science and Technology Foundation; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))","This work was supported in part by the JSPS Postdoctoral Fellowship under Grant 17F17049, and in part by the SECOM Science and Technology Foundation.",,71,6,6,0,5,IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC,PISCATAWAY,"445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA",2169-3536,,,IEEE ACCESS,IEEE Access,,2020,8,,,,,,67603,67616,,10.1109/ACCESS.2020.2985281,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2020.2985281,,,14,"Computer Science, Information Systems; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Telecommunications",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Computer Science; Engineering; Telecommunications,LF4VH,,gold,,,2024-08-15,WOS:000527416700003,,,,655

Aluminum oxide, boron nitride, and titanium nitride coatings were evaluated as possible substrate release agents for aluminum printing. Additionally, the in situ formation of substrate release agents such as intermetallics and oxides were tested for both aluminum and steel printing. Testing was performed with a modified Charpy impact tester to remove 3D printed metal parts from an 1100 aluminum or A36 low carbon steel print substrate to assess the impact energy required for removal. Specimen porosity was measured prior to sectioning and microstructural analysis, hardness traverses were measured across the specimens, and the elastic and shear moduli of the parts were analyzed via ultrasonic methods. All of the employed substrate release mechanisms minimized weld penetration and, in some instances, formed a brittle phase with the print substrate that allowed the specimens to be removed with minimal impact energy. These results thus provide methods with the removal of metal 3-D printed parts from print substrates with no specialized tooling or equipment conducive to distributed manufacturing.

A lack of affordable and adaptable tools in this area limits research progress and harmonized quality assurance.PurposeTo develop and test a suite of open-source hardware and software tools for the measurement, characterization, reporting, and correction of geometric distortion in MRI.MethodsAn open-source python library was developed, comprising modules for parametric phantom design, data processing, spherical harmonics, distortion correction, and interactive reporting. The code was used to design and manufacture a distortion phantom consisting of 618 oil filled markers covering a sphere of radius 150 mm. This phantom was imaged on a CT scanner and a novel split-bore 1.0 T MRI magnet. The CT images provide distortion-free dataset. These data were used to test all modules of the open-source software.ResultsAll markers were successfully extracted from all images. The distorted MRI markers were mapped to undistorted CT data using an iterative search approach. Spherical harmonics reconstructed the fitted gradient data to 1.0 +/- 0.6% of the input data. High resolution data were reconstructed via spherical harmonics and used to generate an interactive report. Finally, distortion correction on an independent data set reduced distortion inside the DSV from 5.5 +/- 3.1 to 1.6 +/- 0.8 mm.ConclusionOpen-source hardware and software for the measurement, characterization, reporting, and correction of geometric distortion in MRI have been developed. The utility of these tools has been demonstrated via their application on a novel 1.0 T split bore magnet.","[Whelan, Brendan M.; Liu, Paul Z. Y.; Shan, Shanshan; Waddington, David E.

Here we demonstrate the 3D printing of hydrophobic PDMS prepolymer resins within a hydrophilic Carbopol gel support via freeform reversible embedding (FRE). In the FRE printing process, the Carbopol support acts as a Bingham plastic that yields and fluidizes when the syringe tip of the 3D printer moves through it, but acts as a solid for the PDMS extruded within it. This, in combination with the immiscibility of hydrophobic PDMS in the hydrophilic Carbopol, confines the PDMS prepolymer within the support for curing times up to 72 h while maintaining dimensional stability. After printing and curing, the Carbopol support gel releases the embedded PDMS prints by using phosphate buffered saline solution to reduce the Carbopol yield stress. As proof-of-concept, we used Sylgard 184 PDMS to 3D print linear and helical filaments via continuous extrusion and cylindrical and helical tubes via layer-by-layer fabrication. Importantly, we show that the 3D printed tubes were manifold and perfusable. The results demonstrate that hydrophobic polymers with low viscosity and long cure times can be 3D printed using a hydrophilic support, expanding the range of biomaterials that can be used in additive manufacturing. Further, by implementing the technology using low cost open-source hardware and software tools, the FRE printing technique can be rapidly implemented for research applications.","[Hinton, Thomas J.; Hudson, Andrew; Lee, Andrew; Feinberg, Adam W.] Carnegie Mellon Univ, Dept Biomed Engn, 5000 Forbes Ave, Pittsburgh, PA 15213 USA; [Pusch, Kira; Feinberg, Adam W.] Carnegie Mellon Univ, Dept Mat Sci & Engn, 5000 Forbes Ave, Pittsburgh, PA 15213 USA",Carnegie Mellon University; Carnegie Mellon University,"Feinberg, AW (corresponding author), Carnegie Mellon Univ, Dept Biomed Engn, 5000 Forbes Ave, Pittsburgh, PA 15213 USA.; Feinberg, AW (corresponding author), Carnegie Mellon Univ, Dept Mat Sci & Engn, 5000 Forbes Ave, Pittsburgh, PA 15213 USA.",feinberg@andrew.cmu.edu,"Feinberg, Adam/A-7103-2009; Hudson, Andrew/ABC-1122-2021","Feinberg, Adam/0000-0003-3338-5456; Lee, Andrew/0000-0001-5174-4999","National Institutes of Health Director's New Innovator Award [DP2HL117750]; Disruptive Health Technology Institute, Carnegie Mellon University [A017261-HIGHMARK-Feinberg]; National Science Foundation CAREER Award [1454248]; Directorate For Engineering; Div Of Civil, Mechanical, & Manufact Inn [1454248] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","National Institutes of Health Director's New Innovator Award(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA); Disruptive Health Technology Institute, Carnegie Mellon University; National Science Foundation CAREER Award(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Directorate For Engineering; Div Of Civil, Mechanical, & Manufact Inn(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Engineering (ENG))","We thank Dr. Rachelle Palchesko Simko for technical assistance with uniaxial tensile testing.

The presented approach employs the Whipple model for the kinematic and inverse dynamic simulation of a bicycle ride using as an input three generalized coordinates registered with digital sensors. During the experimental phase, students ride the instrumented bicycle to collect the necessary sensor data. The kinematic and inverse dynamic simulations based on these signals provide a full picture of the motion of the system in different positions and at a range of velocities and accelerations. In addition, they estimate the traction, control, and tire-to-road contact forces during the ride. To validate the simulated results, the simulated velocity and accelerations are compared with the data acquired with an inertial measurement unit (IMU) installed on the bicycle. The paper describes the experimental setup of the instrumented bicycle, enabling readers to build the very same system for their own educational use.

The use of centrally-manufactured commercial tourniquets, however, is not always possible due to supply chain disruptions. The open-source hardware model has been applied to overcome these disruptions in humanitarian crises and several low-cost digitally manufacturable open-source tourniquets have been developed. With the low reliability of improvised tourniquets, it is important to ensure that distributed manufacturing of tourniquets is effective and safe. Tourniquets can be tested, but existing tourniquet testers are expensive, bulky, and complex to operate, which limits their accessibility to an even greater extent than tourniquets in extreme settings. This article fulfills a need by providing a small, transportable, open-source additive-manufactured tourniquet tester that enables inexpensive and accurate testing of tourniquets against known clinical parameters. The <$100 tourniquet tester is validated and tested for operating force of tourniquets in the field or in distributed manufacturing facilities. The tourniquet tester has a significant economic and operational advantage compared to proprietary counterparts available on the market. Once calibrated with a blood pressure monitor, the built-in LCD displays the measuring range of the tester as 0 to 200 N, which is enough to test the validation of all tourniquets.

Starting with the evaluation board of the chip, open-source hardware and software components were integrated into a breadboard prototype. This required modifying the microchip with the breadboard-friendly Arduino Nano board in addition to a data logger and a Bluetooth breakout board. The digitized ECG signal can be transmitted by serial cable, via Bluetooth to a PC, or to an Android smartphone system for visualization. The data logging shield provides gigabytes of storage, as the signal is recorded to a microSD card adapter. A menu incorporates the device's several operating modes. Simulation and testing assessed the system stability and performance parameters in terms of not losing any sample data throughout the length of the recording and finding the maximum sampling frequency; and validation determined and resolved problems that arose in open-source development. Ultimately, a custom printed circuit board was produced requiring advanced manufacturing options of 2.5 mils trace widths for the small package components. The fabricated device did not degrade the AD823X noise performance, and an ECG waveform with negligible distortion was obtained. The maximum number of samples/second was 2380 Hz in serial cable transmission, whereas in microSD recording mode, a continuous ECG signal for up to 36 h at 500 Hz was verified. A low-cost, high-quality portable ECG for long-term monitoring prototype that reasonably complies with electrical safety regulations and medical equipment design was realized.","[Bravo-Zanoguera, Miguel; Cuevas-Gonzalez, Daniel; Garcia-Vazquez, Juan P.; Avitia, Roberto L.] Autonomous Univ Baja California, Engn Fac, Blvd Benito Juarez S-N, Mexicali 21280, BC, Mexico; [Reyna, Marco A.] Autonomous Univ Baja California, Engn Inst, Blvd Benito Juarez S-N, Mexicali 21280, BC, Mexico",Universidad Autonoma de Baja California; Universidad Autonoma de Baja California,"Bravo-Zanoguera, M (corresponding author), Autonomous Univ Baja California, Engn Fac, Blvd Benito Juarez S-N, Mexicali 21280, BC, Mexico.",mbravo@uabc.edu.mx; cuevas.daniel@uabc.edu.mx; mreyna@uabc.edu.mx; pablo.garcia@uabc.edu.mx; ravitia@uabc.edu.mx,"Lopez, Roberto/JGM-0027-2023; Bravo-Zanoguera, Miguel Enrique/ACL-3911-2022; L.

While the localized benefits of active control are well-established, the potential for system-scale control of watersheds is poorly understood. This study shows how a real-world smart stormwater system can be leveraged to shape streamflow within an urban watershed. Specifically, we coordinate releases from two internet-controlled stormwater basins to achieve desired control objectives downstream such as maintaining the flow at a set-point, and generating interleaved waves. In the first part of the study, we describe the construction of the control network using a low-cost, open-source hardware stack and a cloud-based controller scheduling application. Next, we characterize the system's control capabilities by determining the travel times, decay times, and magnitudes of various waves released from the upstream retention basins. With this characterization in hand, we use the system to generate two desired responses at a critical downstream junction. First, we generate a set-point hydrograph, in which flow is maintained at an approximately constant rate. Next, we generate a series of overlapping and interleaved waves using timed releases from both retention basins. We discuss how these control strategies can be used to stabilize flows, thereby mitigating streambed erosion and reducing contaminant loads into downstream waterbodies.","[Mullapudi, Abhiram; Bartos, Matthew; Wong, Brandon; Kerkez, Branko] Univ Michigan, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA",University of Michigan System; University of Michigan,"Kerkez, B (corresponding author), Univ Michigan, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA.",abhiramm@umich.edu; mdbartos@umich.edu; bpwong@umich.edu; bkerkez@umich.edu,,"Wong, Brandon/0000-0002-0109-6150; Mullapudi, Abhiram/0000-0001-8141-3621; Kerkez, Branko/0000-0002-8041-5366; Bartos, Matthew/0000-0001-6421-222X",Great Lakes Protection Fund [1035]; US National Science Foundation [1737432]; University of Michigan,Great Lakes Protection Fund; US National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); University of Michigan(University of Michigan System),"This research was funded by the Great Lakes Protection Fund (Grant 1035), the US National Science Foundation (Grant 1737432) and the University of Michigan.",,24,26,34,1,21,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,1424-8220,,SENSORS-BASEL,Sensors,JUL,2018,18,7,,,,,,,2259,10.3390/s18072259,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/s18072259,,,11,"Chemistry, Analytical; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Instruments & Instrumentation",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Chemistry; Engineering; Instruments & Instrumentation,GQ0UF,30011820.0,"Green Published, Green Submitted, gold",,,2024-08-15,WOS:000441334300281,,,,662

One way of achieving synchronization involves marking distinct events with electrical pulses (event markers or ""TTL pulses""), which are continuously recorded with research hardware, and can later be temporally aligned. Traditionally, this event marking was often performed using the parallel port in standard personal computers. However, the parallel port is disappearing from the landscape of computer hardware, being replaced by a serial (COM) port, namely the USB port. To find an adequate replacement for the parallel port, we evaluated four microcontroller units (MCUs) and the LabJack U3, an often-used USB data acquisition device, in terms of their latency and jitter for sending event markers in a simulated experiment on both Windows and Linux. Our results show that all four MCUs were comparable to the parallel port in terms of both latency and jitter, and consistently achieved latencies under 1 ms. With some caveats, the LabJack U3 can also achieve comparable latencies. In addition to the collected data, we share extensive documentation on how to build and use MCUs for event marking, including code examples. MCUs are a cost-effective, flexible, and performant replacement for the disappearing parallel port, enabling event marking and synchronization of data streams.","[Appelhoff, Stefan] Max Planck Inst Human Dev, Ctr Adapt Rat, Lentzeallee 94, D-14195 Berlin, Germany; [Stenner, Tristan] Univ Kiel, Univ Med Ctr Schleswig Holstein, Inst Med Psychol & Med Sociol, Kiel, Germany",Max Planck Society; University of Kiel; Schleswig Holstein University Hospital,"Appelhoff, S (corresponding author), Max Planck Inst Human Dev, Ctr Adapt Rat, Lentzeallee 94, D-14195 Berlin, Germany.",appelhoff@mpib-berlin.mpg.de,,"Appelhoff, Stefan/0000-0001-8002-0877; Stenner, Tristan/0000-0002-2428-9051",Fellow-Programm Freies Wissen of Wikimedia Germany; Stifterverband; VolkswagenStiftung,Fellow-Programm Freies Wissen of Wikimedia Germany; Stifterverband; VolkswagenStiftung(Volkswagen),"This project was supported by the Fellow-Programm Freies Wissen of Wikimedia Germany, the Stifterverband, and the VolkswagenStiftung.

EIS results from the developed potentiostat were validated with a commercial benchtop potentiostat by comparing impedance magnitude and phase values along the EIS frequency range. In addition, an experimental design was performed for detecting S100B in spiked human plasma samples with S100B concentrations of clinical utility, and a calibration curve was found for quantifying S100B detection. No statistically significant differences were found between EIS results from the developed potentiostat and the commercial potentiostat. Statistically significant differences in the changes in charge transfer resistance signal between each tested S100B concentration (p < 0.05) were found, with a limit of detection of 35.73 pg/mL. The modularity of the proposed potentiostat allows easier component changes according to the application demands in power, frequency excitation ranges, wireless communication protocol, signal amplification and transduction, precision, and sampling frequency of ADC, among others, when compared to state-of-the-art opensource EIS potentiostats. In addition, the use of minimal, easy acquirable open-source hardware and software, high-level filtering, accurate ADC, Fast Fourier Transform with low spectral leakage, wireless communication, and the simple user interface provides a framework for facilitating EIS analysis and developing new affordable instrumentation for POC biosensors integrated systems.","[Burgos-Florez, Francisco; Rodriguez, Alexander; Cervera, Eliana; Villalba, Pedro J.] Univ Norte, Dept Med, Biotechnol Res Grp, Barranquilla, Colombia; [Burgos-Florez, Francisco; Sanjuan, Marco] Univ Norte, Dept Mech Engn, Rat Use Energy & Preservat Environm Grp UREMA, Barranquilla, Colombia; [Zucolotto, Valtencir] Univ Sao Paulo, Sao Carlos Inst Phys, GNano Nanomed & Nanotoxicol Grp, Sao Carlos, SP, Brazil",Universidad del Norte Colombia; Universidad del Norte Colombia; Universidade de Sao Paulo,"Villalba, PJ (corresponding author), Univ Norte, Dept Med, Biotechnol Res Grp, Barranquilla, Colombia.",villalbap@uninorte.edu.co,,"Rodriguez Sanjuan, Alexander/0000-0001-6424-7254; Villalba, Pedro/0000-0003-3015-0299","Departamento Administrativo de Ciencia, Tecnologia e Innovacion (COLCIENCIAS) [757-2016]; Gobernacion del Atlantico [809-2018]","Departamento Administrativo de Ciencia, Tecnologia e Innovacion (COLCIENCIAS)(Departamento Administrativo de Ciencia, Tecnologia e Innovacion Colciencias); Gobernacion del Atlantico","This work was funded by Departamento Administrativo de Ciencia, Tecnologia e Innovacion (COLCIENCIAS) grant number 757-2016 (FB) and by Gobernacion del Atlantico call number 809-2018 (AR).

This real power transmission network is simulated by using MATLAB/Simulink software. In this paper, the hardware implementation is also carried out using an open-source hardware, Arduino, which consists of an Atmel 8-bit AVR microcontroller. Both the simulation and hardware results validate that the proposed scheme is accurately detecting, classifying, and locating the fault in less than a half cycle time.

These methods are basically based on the recording of seismic ambient noise and analysis of its spectral features. Although these techniques are more practical than traditional seismic methods, the commercial instruments designed for recording the seismic ambient noise are quite expensive. Furthermore, most of these instruments require an external computer for recording and monitoring the data. In this sense, this article intends to present a low-cost and Raspberry Pi single-board microcomputer aided seismic ambient noise recording and monitoring system (RaspMI) as an alternative to the computer aided commercial seismic noise measurement systems. RaspMI is an open-source hardware and software system that is controlled by a graphical user interface developed by using the MonoDevelop cross-platform and C# programming language. This system has many features such as 72 dB dynamic range, 100 Hz sampling frequency, timer recording mode, text and SAC data file format, and latitude, longitude, date and time support with GPS module. RaspMI has subjected to the various tests in terms of the reliability and sensitivity. The obtained results have shown that RaspMI can be used as an alternative instrument for seismic ambient noise measurements.","[Kafadar, Ozkan] Kocaeli Univ, Comp Programming Dept, TR-41140 Kocaeli, Turkey",Kocaeli University,"Kafadar, Ö (corresponding author), Kocaeli Univ, Comp Programming Dept, TR-41140 Kocaeli, Turkey.",okafadar@kocaeli.edu.tr,"KAFADAR, ÖZKAN/F-6475-2018",,,,,,33,12,13,0,23,IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC,PISCATAWAY,"445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA",1530-437X,1558-1748,,IEEE SENS J,IEEE Sens.

The bill of materials and assembly instructions are detailed, and the effectiveness of the autoinjector is tested against the current standard (ISO 11608-1:2022) for needle-based injection systems. The safety and dosing accuracy was tested by measuring the weight of 100% ethyl alcohol expelled from six BD Insulin syringes with varying capacities or needle lengths. A one-way analysis assessed the variability between the dose delivery efficiency of 1mL, 0.5mL, and 0.3mL syringes. Testing indicated that the entire dose was delivered over 97.5% of the time for 1mL and 0.5mL syringes, but the autoinjector's loaded spring force and size exceeded structural limitations of 0.3mL or smaller syringes. Components can be manufactured in about twelve hours using an open-source desktop RepRap-class fused filament 3-D printer. The construction requires two compression springs and 3-D printed parts. The total material cost of CAD$6.83 is less than a tenth of comparable commercial autoinjectors, which makes this approach promising. The autoinjector, however, is a class two medical device and must be approved by regulators. Future work is needed to make distributed manufacturing of such medical devices feasible and reliable to support individuals burdened by healthcare costs.","[Selvaraj, Anjutha] Western Univ, Fac Sci Med Sci & Environm Sci, London, ON, Canada; [Kulkarni, Apoorv; Pearce, J.

This article describes the invention of a new testing system: the parametric open source cold-frame agrivoltaic system (POSCAS).

POSCAS is designed to test partially transparent solar photovoltaic (PV) modules targeting the agrivoltaic market. It can both function as a traditional cold frame, but it can also be automated to function as a full-service greenhouse. The integrated PV module roof can be used to power the controls or it can be attached to a microinverter to produce power. POSCAS can be placed in an experimental array for testing agricultural and power production. It can be easily adapted for any type of partially transparent PV module. An array of POSCAS systems allows for the testing of agrivoltaic impacts from the percent transparency of the modules by varying the thickness of a thin film PV material or the density of silicon-based cells, and various forms of optical enhancement, anti-reflection coatings and solar light spectral shifting materials in the back sheet. All agrivoltaic variables can be customized to identify ideal PV designs for a given agricultural crop.","[Pearce, Joshua M.] Western Univ, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, London, ON N6A 5B9, Canada; [Pearce, Joshua M.] Western Univ, Ivey Business Sch, London, ON N6G 0N1, Canada",Western University (University of Western Ontario); Western University (University of Western Ontario),"Pearce, JM (corresponding author), Western Univ, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, London, ON N6A 5B9, Canada.; Pearce, JM (corresponding author), Western Univ, Ivey Business Sch, London, ON N6G 0N1, Canada.",joshua.pearce@uwo.ca,"Pearce, Joshua/C-9240-2013","Pearce, Joshua/0000-0001-9802-3056",,,,,147,8,8,0,18,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2411-5134,,INVENTIONS-BASEL,Inventions,DEC,2021,6,4,,,,,,,71,10.3390/inventions6040071,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/inventions6040071,,,20,"Engineering, Multidisciplinary",Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI),Engineering,XZ3PT,,gold,,,2024-08-15,WOS:000737568200001,,,,677

The proposed device has been developed with free software and hardware, which makes it a pioneering solution because it is open and accessible as well as capable of being improved by the scientific community, thereby contributing to the rapid advancement of technology. In addition, the device includes an algorithm developed ex professo that makes it possible to predetermine the regions of the celestial sphere for which, according to the geometric characteristics of the PV plant, there would be shading between the panels. In this way, solar trackers do not have to locate the Sun's position at all times according to astronomical models, while taking into account factors such as shadows or cloudiness that also affect levels of incident irradiance on solar collectors. Therefore, with this device, it is possible to provide photovoltaic plants with dual-axis solar tracking with a low-cost device that helps to optimise the trajectory of the trackers and, consequently, their radiative capture and energy production.","[Gomez-Uceda, Francisco J.] Univ Cordoba, Dept Mech, Campus Rabanales, Cordoba 14071, Spain; [Ramirez-Faz, Jose; Fernandez-Ahumada, Luis Manuel] Univ Cordoba, Dept Elect Engn & Automat, Campus Rabanales, Cordoba 14071, Spain; [Varo-Martinez, Marta] Univ Cordoba, Dept Appl Phys Radiol & Phys Med, Campus Rabanales, Cordoba 14071, Spain",Universidad de Cordoba; Universidad de Cordoba; Universidad de Cordoba,"Varo-Martinez, M (corresponding author), Univ Cordoba, Dept Appl Phys Radiol & Phys Med, Campus Rabanales, Cordoba 14071, Spain.",fjgomez@uco.es; jramirez@uco.es; fa2vamam@uco.es; lmfernandez@uco.es,"Fernández-Ahumada, Luis Manuel/AAC-3303-2020; FernÃ¡ndez-Ahumada, Luis M./GNW-2351-2022; VARO-MARTINEZ, MARTA/F-9794-2016; Gomez Uceda, Francisco Javier/GQZ-2137-2022","Fernández-Ahumada, Luis Manuel/0000-0002-2355-0190; VARO-MARTINEZ, MARTA/0000-0003-4867-5528; Ramirez Faz, Jose/0000-0002-6529-0649; Gomez Uceda, Francisco Javier/0000-0002-2350-0900",CLARA Project from the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme [730482]; H2020 Societal Challenges Programme [730482] Funding Source: H2020 Societal Challenges Programme,CLARA Project from the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme; H2020 Societal Challenges Programme(Horizon 2020European Union (EU)H2020 Societal Challenges Programme),"This research is partially supported by the CLARA Project, which has received funding from the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under Grant Agreement No 730482.",,65,8,8,2,5,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,1424-8220,,SENSORS-BASEL,Sensors,FEB,2021,21,3,,,,,,,726,10.3390/s21030726,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/s21030726,,,16,"Chemistry, Analytical; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Instruments & Instrumentation",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Chemistry; Engineering; Instruments & Instrumentation,QD4LU,33494507.0,"Green Published, gold",,,2024-08-15,WOS:000615492600001,,,,678

The device developed in this work is the cup anemometer, that is easy to build. The great advantage of this device is the low cost, with an approximate value of US$ 50.00, using simple materials that are easy to find in commercial stores. The Reed Switch sensor is also another advantage as it does not require a sophisticated programming, as well as the open platform Arduino. The use of theoretical aerodynamic drag coefficients and the presented calculations resulted in values very close to a commercial anemometer. The coefficient of determination between the cup Anemometer and the standard sensor of Meteorological Research Institute IPMet/Brazil is R-2=0.9999, indicating strong correlation between the instruments.

This tension compression nonlinearity enhances interstitial fluid pressurization and decreases the frictional coefficient. The current set of studies examines the tensile and compressive properties of cylindrical chondrocyte-seeded agarose constructs over different developmental stages through a novel method that combines osmotic loading, video microscopy, and uniaxial unconfined compression testing. This method was previously used to examine tension-compression nonlinearity in native cartilage. Engineered cartilage, cultured under free-swelling (FS) or dynamically loaded (DL) conditions, was tested in unconfined compression in hypertonic and hypotonic salt solutions. The apparent equilibrium modulus decreased with increasing salt concentration, indicating that increasing the bath solution osmolarity shielded the fixed charges within the tissue, shifting the measured moduli along the tension-compression curve and revealing the intrinsic properties of the tissue. With this method, we were able to measure the tensile (401 +/- 83 kPa for FS and 678 +/- 473 kPa for DL) and compressive (161 +/- 33 kPa for FS and 348 +/- 203 kPa for DL) moduli of the same engineered cartilage specimens. These moduli are comparable to values obtained from traditional methods, validating this technique for measuring the tensile and compressive properties of hydrogel-based constructs.

The system is comprised of a Raspberry Pi computer connected to a 3D printer controller board that has controls for a CO2 sensor, solenoid valve, heater, and thermistors. CO2 is supplied through the sublimation of dry ice stored inside a thermos to create a sustained 5% CO2 supply. The unit is controlled via G-Code commands sent by the Raspberry Pi to the controller board. In addition, we built a custom software application for remote control and used the open-source Grafana dashboard for remote monitoring. Our data show that we can maintain consistent CO2 and temperature levels for over three days without manual interruption. The results from our culture plates and real-time PCR indicate that our incubator performed equally well when compared to a much more expensive commercial CO2 incubator.

This is achieved by measuring optical density at 600 nm using a spectrophotometer, which measures the effect of absorbance and side scattering due to turbidity of cells suspensions. However, when growth kinetics must be monitored in many 96-well plates at the same time, buying several 96-channel spectrophotometers is often beyond budgets. The MiniRead device presented here is a simple and inexpensive do-it-yourself 96-well temperature-controlled turbidimeter designed to measure the interception of white light via absorption or side scattering through liquid culture medium. Turbidity is automatically recorded in each well at regular time intervals for up to several days or weeks. Output tabulated text files are recorded into a micro-SD memory card to be easily transferred to a computer. We propose also an R package which allows (1) to compute the nonlinear calibration curves required to convert raw readings into cell concentration values, and (2) to analyze growth kinetics output files to automatically estimate proxies of growth parameters such as lag time, maximum growth rate, or cell concentration at the plateau. The MiniRead is a simple and cheap open-hardware open-source do-it-yourself turbidimeter.

The frequently cited promises of modular robotics-versatility, robustness, and low cost-assume the availability of large numbers of modules. However, modules in most MR prototypes are large, mechanically complex, expensive, and difficult to manufacture. Soldercubes partially overcome this contradiction through optimizing some components for volume manufacturing processes. With the integration of a soldering connector which weighs only 2 g and has no moving parts, Soldercubes are among the cheapest, lightest and smallest among comparable self-reconfiguring MR systems. This paper describes the Soldercube module design in detail, reports on experiments in a lattice configuration, explores non-lattice applications of the system, and discusses the effects of utilising volume manufacturing processes in module production.

These plants face several technical problems and the inspection of components such as absorber tubes in parabolic trough concentrators (PTC), which are widely deployed, is necessary to guarantee plant efficiency. This article presents a system for real-time industrial inspection of CSP plants using low-cost, open-source components in conjunction with a thermographic sensor and an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). The system, available in open-source hardware and software, is designed to be employed independently of the type of device used for inspection (laptop, smartphone, tablet or smartglasses) and its operating system. Several UAV flight missions were programmed as follows: flight altitudes at 20, 40, 60, 80, 100 and 120 m above ground level; and three cruising speeds: 5, 7 and 10 m/s. These settings were chosen and analyzed in order to optimize inspection time. The results indicate that it is possible to perform inspections by an UAV in real time at CSP plants as a means of detecting anomalous absorber tubes and improving the effectiveness of methodologies currently being utilized. Moreover, aside from thermographic sensors, this contribution can be applied to other sensors and can be used in a broad range of applications where real-time georeferenced data visualization is necessary.","[Javier Mesas-Carrascosa, Francisco; Verdu Santano, Daniel; Perez Porras, Fernando; Emilio Merono-Larriva, Jose; Garcia-Ferrer, Alfonso] Univ Cordoba, Dept Graph Engn & Geomat, Campus Rabanales, E-14071 Cordoba, Spain",Universidad de Cordoba,"Mesas-Carrascosa, FJ (corresponding author), Univ Cordoba, Dept Graph Engn & Geomat, Campus Rabanales, E-14071 Cordoba, Spain.",fjmesas@uco.es; p12vesad@uco.es; perezporras.fernando@gmail.com; ir1melaj@uco.es; agferrer@uco.es,"Pérez Porras, Fernando/AIC-7686-2022; García-Ferrer, Alfonso/Q-8365-2019; Mesas-Carrascosa, Francisco Javier/L-3094-2017","Pérez Porras, Fernando/0000-0003-4263-2260; García-Ferrer, Alfonso/0000-0002-7558-400X; Mesas-Carrascosa, Francisco Javier/0000-0002-5674-1292",Khepri project - CDTI: Centro para el Desarrollo Tecnologico Industrial; FEDER Funds: Fondo Europeo de Desarrollo Regional; CTA: Corporacion Tecnologica de Andalucia,Khepri project - CDTI: Centro para el Desarrollo Tecnologico Industrial; FEDER Funds: Fondo Europeo de Desarrollo Regional; CTA: Corporacion Tecnologica de Andalucia,"This research was funded by Khepri project supported by CDTI: Centro para el Desarrollo Tecnologico Industrial, FEDER Funds: Fondo Europeo de Desarrollo Regional and CTA: Corporacion Tecnologica de Andalucia.

The system comprises a Raspberry Pi camera mounted on an aluminium extrusion frame with 3D-printed joints controlled by an Arduino microcontroller running open-source Repetier Host Firmware. The camera position is controlled by simple G-code scripts supplied from a Raspberry Pi singleboard computer and allow customized time-lapse imaging of microdevices over a large imaging area. Open-source OctoPrint software allows remote access and control. This simple yet effective design allows high-throughput microbiology testing in multiple formats including formats for bacterial motility, colony growth, microtitre plates and microfluidic devices termed 'lab-on-a-comb' to screen the effects of different culture media components and antibiotics on bacterial growth. The open-source robot design allows customization of the size of the imaging area; the current design has an imaging area of similar to 420 x 300mm, which allows 29 'lab-on-a-comb' devices to be imaged which is equivalent 3480 individual 1 mu l samples.

A segmented SAR-ADC uses a coarse SAR-ADC to compute some most significant bits (MSBs). Four methods, namely aligned switching (AS) with bitwise RCRs, AS with a subsample-wise RCR, detect-and-skip aligned switching (DAS-AS) with bitwise RCRs, and DAS-AS with a subsample-wise RCR are introduced for setting fine MSBs. Closed-form analytic expressions of the reference error due to the finite reference capacitance are derived and validated by behavioral modeling and circuit simulation of an 11-bit 50 MS/s segmented SAR ADC in 65-nm CMOS technology. The error expressions can be used to select one of the four methods for setting the fine MSBs and to determine \beta for the required linearity or for implementing digital circuitry for precise error correction.","[Wang, Aili; Shi, C. -J.

However, there is currently a lack of instrumentation to monitor such experiments in real time, necessitating repeated transfers of the samples to stand-alone analytical instruments, thus limiting the types of experiments that could be performed. Here we address this gap with the development of the optoPlateReader (oPR), an open-source, solid-state, compact device that allows automated optogenetic stimulation and spectroscopy in each well of a 96-well plate. The oPR integrates an optoPlate illumination module with a module called the optoReader, an array of 96 photodiodes and LEDs that allows 96 parallel light measurements. The oPR was optimized for stimulation with blue light and for measurements of optical density and fluorescence. After calibration of all device components, we used the oPR to measure growth and to induce and measure fluorescent protein expression in E. coli. We further demonstrated how the optical read/write capabilities of the oPR permit computer-in-the-loop feedback control, where the current state of the sample can be used to adjust the optical stimulation parameters of the sample according to pre-defined feedback algorithms. The oPR will thus help realize an untapped potential for optogenetic experiments by enabling automated reading, writing, and feedback in microwell plates through open-source hardware that is accessible, customizable, and inexpensive. An open source, 96-well plate reader allows simultaneous optogenetic stimulation and absorbance/fluorescence measurements in each well.","[Benman, William; Datta, Saachi; Gonzalez-Martinez, David; Lee, Gloria; Hooper, Juliette; Qian, Grace; Leavitt, Gabrielle; Salloum, Lana; Ho, Gabrielle; Mhatre, Sharvari; Magaraci, Michael S.; Patterson, Michael; Mannickarottu, Sevile G.; Chow, Brian Y.; Bugaj, Lukasz J.] Univ Penn, Dept Bioengn, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Malani, Saurabh; Avalos, Jose L.] Princeton Univ, Dept Chem & Biol Engn, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA; [Avalos, Jose L.] Andlinger Ctr Energy & Environm, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA; [Avalos, Jose L.] High Meadows Environm Inst, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA; [Bugaj, Lukasz J.] Univ Penn, Abramson Canc Ctr, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Bugaj, Lukasz J.] Univ Penn, Inst Regenerat Med, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA",University of Pennsylvania; Princeton University; University of Pennsylvania; University of Pennsylvania,"Bugaj, LJ (corresponding author), Univ Penn, Dept Bioengn, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA.; Bugaj, LJ (corresponding author), Univ Penn, Abramson Canc Ctr, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA.; Bugaj, LJ (corresponding author), Univ Penn, Inst Regenerat Med, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA.",bugaj@seas.upenn.edu,,"Leavitt, Gabrielle/0000-0002-3138-6271","Foundation for the National Institutes of Health (Foundation for the National Institutes of Health, Inc.); Bradley Gabel Memorial Fund [R35GM138211, R01NS101106]; National Institutes of Health [CAREER CBET 2145699, MCB 1652003, CAREER CBET 1751840]; National Science Foundation [DE-SC0019363, DE-SC0022155]; U.S. Department of Energy (Office of Science, Office of Biological and Environmental Research, Genomic Science Program); Singapore's STAR Fellowship; U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) [DE-SC0022155] Funding Source: U.S. Department of Energy (DOE)","Foundation for the National Institutes of Health (Foundation for the National Institutes of Health, Inc.)(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA); Bradley Gabel Memorial Fund; National Institutes of Health(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA); National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); U.S. Department of Energy (Office of Science, Office of Biological and Environmental Research, Genomic Science Program)(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); Singapore's STAR Fellowship; U.S. Department of Energy (DOE)(United States Department of Energy (DOE))","We thank the George H.

Running multiple columns simultaneously saves time and improves procedural consistency. Though column chro-matography is widely used, to meet their laboratory needs many investigators must resort to designing and fabricating custom racks for holding their chromatography columns. We have created a robust column rack design, with collection vial holders, that is easily made, inexpensive to build, and may be easily adapted to fit experimental needs. The column holder can be made to hold various sizes of columns (and can be interchanged as neces-sary); the height of columns above collection vials can be precisely set; and the design is modular, so the rack and vial holders can be expanded to accommodate the desired num-bers of columns and the numbers and sizes of vials used to collect fractions eluted from each column. Importantly, the rack is made of inexpensive, readily-available materials and the fabrication is straightforward. Here we present details of the rack's features, a list of materials, and instructions for making it. We hope our design will help investigators who perform gravity-driven column chromatography.

Given fundamental power requirements for such communication, burdened mass guidelines and battery technology, this constraint necessitates the continued use of very high frequency (VHF) radio beacons. As such, efforts should be made to mitigate their primary deficiencies: detection range, localization time and localization accuracy. The integration of a radiotelemetry system with an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) could significantly improve the capacity for data collection from VHF tags. We present a UAV-integrated radiotelemetry system that relies on open source hardware and software. Localization methods, including signal processing, bearing estimation based on principal component analysis, localization techniques and test results, are discussed. Using a low-power beacon applicable for bats and small birds, testing showed that the improved vantage of the UAV-radiotelemetry system (UAV-RT) provided significantly higher received signal power compared to the low-level flights (maximum range beyond 1.4 km). Flight testing of localization methods showed median bearing errors between 2.3 degrees and 6.8 degrees, with localization errors of between 5% and 14% of the distance to the tag. In a direct comparison to an experienced radiotelemetry user, the UAV-RT system provided bearing and localization estimates with 53% less error. This paper introduces the core functionality and use methods of the UAV-RT system, while presenting baseline localization performance metrics. An associated website hosts plans for assembly and software installation. The methods of UAV-RT use for tag detection will be further developed in future works. For both the detection and localization problems, the mobility of a flying asset drastically reduces tracker time requirements. A 7-min flight would be sufficient to collect five equally spaced bearing estimates over a 1-km transect. The use of a software-defined radio on the UAV-RT system will allow for the simultaneous detection and localization of multiple tags.","[Shafer, Michael W.; Vega, Gabriel; Rothfus, Kellan] No Arizona Univ, Dept Mech Engn, Flagstaff, AZ 86011 USA; [Flikkema, Paul] No Arizona Univ, Sch Informat Comp & Cyber Syst, Flagstaff, AZ 86011 USA",Northern Arizona University; Northern Arizona University,"Shafer, MW (corresponding author), No Arizona Univ, Dept Mech Engn, Flagstaff, AZ 86011 USA.",michael.shafer@nau.edu,,"Shafer, Michael/0000-0001-6894-4460; Flikkema, Paul/0000-0003-2985-7895",Division of Biological Infrastructure [1556417]; National Science Foundation; Direct For Biological Sciences; Div Of Biological Infrastructure [1556417] Funding Source: National Science Foundation,Division of Biological Infrastructure(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Biological Sciences (BIO)); National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Direct For Biological Sciences; Div Of Biological Infrastructure(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Biological Sciences (BIO)),"Division of Biological Infrastructure, Grant/Award Number: 1556417; National Science Foundation",,32,12,17,3,39,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",2041-210X,2041-2096,,METHODS ECOL EVOL,Methods Ecol.

However, developing such equipment at a small scale for academic research is not available owing to highly priced commercial products.

A cableless seismic system requires the combination of signal sensing, simple pre-processing, and data storage in a single device. A conventional geophone is used as the sensor that detects the seismic wave signal. In addition, it is connected to an Arduino circuit that plays a role in implementing the processing and storing module for the detected signals. Three main functions are implemented in the Arduino module: preprocessing, A/D conversion, and data storage. The developed single-channel module can acquire a common receiver gather from multiple source experiments.","[Kim, Chanil] AAT, Seoul, South Korea; [Cho, Sangin; Pyun, Sukjoon] Inha Univ, Dept Energy Resources Engn, 100 Inharo, Incheon 22212, South Korea",Inha University,"Pyun, S (corresponding author), Inha Univ, Dept Energy Resources Engn, 100 Inharo, Incheon 22212, South Korea.",pyunsj@inha.ac.kr,,,,,,,35,0,0,0,0,KOREAN SOC EARTH & EXPLORATION GEOPHYSICISTS,DAEJEON,"RM 1804, HANJIN OFFICETEL, 31, DAEHAK-RO, YUSEONG-GU, DAEJEON, 305-301, SOUTH KOREA",1229-1064,2384-051X,,GEOPHYS GEOPHYS EXPL,Geophys.

We show that such an increase in fluorescence emission of extracellular pigment complexes (PC) from these photosynthetic bacteria depends on the concentration of the pigment and temperature and can also be modulated by the static magnetic field. The time-dependent enhanced emission disappears either at or below 300 K or below a threshold sample concentration (0.1 mg/ml). The enhanced emission reappears at this condition (T < 278 K) if a static magnetic field (395 mT) is introduced during fluorescence measurement. The time dependence of emission is expressed in terms of a first-order rate constant, k = dF/(Fdt). The sign of k shifts from positive to negative as PC concentration is lowered than a threshold value, implying onset of fluorescence decay (k < 0) rather than amplification (k > 0). At PC concentration higher than a threshold, k becomes negative if the temperature is lowered. But, surprisingly, at low temperature, a static magnetic field reverts the k value to positive. We explain the logical nature of k-switching and photo-dynamics of the aforesaid microbial fluorescence emission by aggregation of protoporphyrin rings present in the PC. While the simultaneous presence of decay in fluorescence and susceptibility to static magnetic field suggests the dominance of triplet states at low temperatures, the process is reversed by SMF-induced removal of spin degeneracy. At higher temperatures, the optical excitability and lack of magnetic response suggest the dominance of singlet states. We propose that the restructuring of the singlet-triplet distribution by intersystem crossing may be the basis of this logical behaviour. In context with microbial function, time-dependent enhancement of fluorescence also implies relay of red photons to the neighbouring microbes not directly exposed to the incident radiation, thus serving as an indirect photosynthetic regulator.","[Bose, Anirban; Ray, Sanhita; Dasgupta, Anjan Kr] Univ Calcutta, Dept Biochem, Kolkata, India; [Chowdhury, Rajdeep; Nandi, Somen] Indian Assoc Cultivat Sci, Dept Phys Chem, Kolkata, India; [Raja, Sufi O.] Duke Univ, Dept Phys, Durham, NC 27706 USA; [Bhattacharyya, Kankan] IISER, Dept Chem, Bhopal, India",University of Calcutta; Department of Science & Technology (India); Indian Association for the Cultivation of Science (IACS) - Jadavpur; Duke University; Indian Institute of Science Education & Research (IISER) - Bhopal,"Dasgupta, AK (corresponding author), Univ Calcutta, Dept Biochem, Kolkata, India.",anirban2128@gmail.com; rajdeep.873@gmail.com; somchemrnp@gmail.com; sufi.raja@duke.edu; daladysphinc@gmail.com; kankan.bhattacharyya@gmail.com; adbioc@caluniv.ac.in,"Chowdhury, Rajdeep/HZK-8631-2023; Chowdhury, Rajdeep/J-1878-2012; Nandi, Somen/E-1428-2018","Chowdhury, Rajdeep/0000-0002-6717-4721; Raja, Sufi O./0000-0001-5355-1453; Nandi, Somen/0000-0001-8484-761X","MEITy, Govt. of India [13(10)/2016-CC BT]; Department of Biotechnology, Ministry of Science and Technology [BT/PR3957/NNT/28/659/2013]","MEITy, Govt. of India; Department of Biotechnology, Ministry of Science and Technology","We thank MEITy, Govt. of India (Project Open Hardware Based Digital Communicable Biosensing Platform, 13(10)/2016-CC & BT and Department of Biotechnology, Ministry of Science and Technology (BT/PR3957/NNT/28/659/2013).

A nonlinear autoregressive network with exogenous inputs (NARX) was implemented in a serial-parallel architecture. The PV module mathematical modeling was developed, a buck converter was designed to operate in the continuous conduction mode with a switching frequency of 20 KHz, and the dynamic neural controller was designed using the Neural Network Toolbox from Matlab/Simulink (MathWorks, Natick, MA, USA), and it was implemented on an open-hardware Arduino Mega board. To obtain the reference signals for the NARX and determine the 65 W PV module behavior, a system made of a 0.8 W PV cell, a temperature sensor, a voltage sensor and a static neural network, was used. To evaluate performance a comparison with the P&O traditional algorithm was done in terms of response time and oscillations around the operating point. Simulation results demonstrated the superiority of neural controller over the P&O. Implementation results showed that approximately the same power is obtained with both controllers, but the P&O controller presents oscillations between 7 W and 10 W, in contrast to the inverse controller, which had oscillations between 1 W and 2 W.","[Robles Algarin, Carlos; Sevilla Hernandez, Deimer; Restrepo Leal, Diego] Univ Magdalena, Fac Ingn, Carrera 32 22-08, Santa Marta 470004, Colombia",Universidad del Magdalena,"Robles Algarín, C (corresponding author), Univ Magdalena, Fac Ingn, Carrera 32 22-08, Santa Marta 470004, Colombia.",carlosarturo.ing@gmail.com; el.deimkydj@gmail.com; diegorestrepoleal@gmail.com,,"Restrepo-Leal, Diego/0000-0001-8938-6584; Robles Algarin, Carlos/0000-0002-5879-5243",Vicerrectoria de Investigacion of the Universidad del Magdalena,Vicerrectoria de Investigacion of the Universidad del Magdalena,This work was supported by the Vicerrectoria de Investigacion of the Universidad del Magdalena.,,34,26,26,0,10,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",2079-9292,,,ELECTRONICS-SWITZ,Electronics,JAN,2018,7,1,,,,,,,4,10.3390/electronics7010004,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/electronics7010004,,,17,"Computer Science, Information Systems; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Physics, Applied",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Computer Science; Engineering; Physics,FU8NX,,"Green Submitted, gold",,,2024-08-15,WOS:000424110800004,,,,700

Methods: Forty-eight cylindrical-shaped specimens (10 x 2 mm) were prepared with a nano-hybrid RBC (Clearfil Majesty ES-2) and randomly divided in four groups according to the experimental staining procedure: G1) static immersion in a staining solution (coffee) (44 +/- 1 degrees C); G2) staining cycling between coffee (44 +/- 1 degrees C) and distilled water (37 +/- 1 degrees C) with an experimental staining machine based on Arduino, an Open Source hardware development platform; G3) staining cycles as in G2 + brushing with a low abrasive toothpaste (Relative Dentin Abrasion RDA = 30) (Elmex Sensitive Professional); G4) staining cycles as in G3, with brushing performed with a very strong abrasive toothpaste (RDA = 90) (Lacult Active). Color parameters were recorded at the baseline (T0) after staining procedures (T1) and repolishing (T2) using a spectrophotometer. Color change ( increment E00) and translucency (TP, CR) were evaluated. Data were statistically analyzed (p < 0.05). Results: For increment E00 after staining, Group 1 showed the highest color change and Group 3 the lowest. All groups were significantly different (p < 0.001) except for Group 2 vs. Group 4; after repolishing, Group 1 was significantly higher than Group 3 (p < 0.001), Group 2 (p < 0.001), and Group 4 (p = 0.003); Group 2 was higher than Group 3 (p < 0.001). For TP variable, after staining procedures, Group 2 was significantly higher than all other groups (p < 0.001), and Group 1 was significantly higher than Group 3 (p < 0.001) and Group 4 (p = 0.007). After repolishing, Group 4 was significantly lower than Group 3 (p = 0.008) and Group 2 (p = 0.027). Repolishing procedure significantly reduced color parameters. Conclusions: The investigated staining procedure induced significant differences in color stability and translucency. The use of a very strong abrasive toothpaste (RDA = 90) induced higher color change than a low abrasive one (RDA = 30). Repolishing procedures are able to partially reduce color change induced by artificial staining procedures.","[Paolone, Gaetano; Boggio, Francesca; Gherlone, Enrico; Cantatore, Giuseppe] Univ Vita Salute San Raffaele, IRCCS San Raffaele Hosp, Dent Sch, I-20132 Milan, Italy; [Mazzitelli, Claudia; Breschi, Lorenzo] Univ Bologna, Dept Biomed & Neuromotor Sci, DIBINEM, Alma Mater Studiorum, Via San Vitale 59, I-40125 Bologna, Italy; [Vichi, Alessandro] Univ Portsmouth, Dent Acad, William Beatty Bldg, Hampshire Terrace, Portsmouth PO1 2QG, England",Vita-Salute San Raffaele University; IRCCS Ospedale San Raffaele; University of Bologna; University of Portsmouth,"Paolone, G (corresponding author), Univ Vita Salute San Raffaele, IRCCS San Raffaele Hosp, Dent Sch, I-20132 Milan, Italy.",paolone.gaetano@hsr.it,"Cantatore, Giuseppe/JVO-5961-2024; Gherlone, Enrico/M-7376-2016","Cantatore, Giuseppe/0009-0006-1535-4014; Vichi, Alessandro/0000-0002-1158-5388; Paolone, Gaetano/0000-0002-8967-6132; Gherlone, Enrico/0000-0002-5193-8467; Breschi, Lorenzo/0000-0001-7621-226X",,,,,46,5,5,2,8,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,1996-1944,,MATERIALS,Materials,MAR,2023,16,6,,,,,,,2336,10.3390/ma16062336,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ma16062336,,,13,"Chemistry, Physical; Materials Science, Multidisciplinary; Metallurgy & Metallurgical Engineering; Physics, Applied; Physics, Condensed Matter",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Chemistry; Materials Science; Metallurgy & Metallurgical Engineering; Physics,A9WM6,36984216.0,"Green Published, gold",,,2024-08-15,WOS:000958547500001,,,,707

X4-MaG is a small, low-cost open quadrotor of only 307-grammes which offers two levels of controllers providing a manual mode and an automatic mode thanks to powerful Linux-based controller embedded onboard. The experiments presented here show the reliability of the open hardware and software embedded onboard the quadrotor. To estimate the robot s attitude, a quaternion-based complementary filter requiring very few computational resources was developed and implemented on an 8-bit Arduino board. It was also established that the stabilization feedback system based on quaternions tracks the attitude setpoints with precision up to twice greater than a classical cascaded PI controller. The controllers and estimators were designed in the Matlab/Simulink environment and directly implemented onboard the tiny Linux-based autopilot board using a custom made toolbox (RT-MaG toolbox). The autopilot was tested in the brand-new Marseilles Flying Arena with various 3-D flight trajectories and found to be highly accurate with errors of only 0.7cm in hover and less than 3.2cm at 1.2m.s(-1).

Between crops, weeds are typically controlled by applying herbicides or tillage to the entire field. However, these control methods are expensive and can pose environmental risks. Robotic weeding systems are a good solution to minimize environmental impact and save money on herbicides, but they are expensive (>$100,000). The Weed Warden is a low-cost (<$200) plant detection sensor that can be mounted on rovers or tractors. The Weed Warden uses an open source multispectral sensor to detect live vegetation and sends a logic signal that could trigger a weed removal system such as a sprayer or mechanical tillage when vegetation is detected. We evaluate the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Enhanced Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (ENDVI), and Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI), for producing a value that, combined with a calibrated threshold, will indicate if there is plant life under the sensor. The Weed Warden system using ENDVI is most consistent at detection, with the ability to discriminate 7.6x7.6 cm vegetation samples from bare soil at sensor heights of 30 and 41 cm from the ground. The Weed Warden is a proof-of-concept component of an alternative system to robotic weeders of fallow fields that could help reduce costs, improve environmental outcomes in agricultural settings, and advance research into fallow field management practices.(c) 2022 The Authors.

In this paper, we introduce an innovative turbidity sensor, and it is the first low-cost turbidity sensor that is designed specifically for long-term stormwater in-field monitoring. Its low cost (USD 23.50) enables the implementation of high spatial resolution monitoring schemes. The sensor design is available under open hardware and open-source licences, and the 3D-printed sensor housing is free to modify based on different monitoring purposes and ambient conditions. The sensor was tested both in the laboratory and in the field. By testing the sensor in the lab with standard turbidity solutions, the proposed low-cost turbidity sensor demonstrated a strong linear correlation between a low-cost sensor and a commercial hand-held turbidimeter. In the field, the low-cost sensor measurements were statistically significantly correlated to a standard high-cost commercial turbidity sensor. Biofouling and drifting issues were also analysed after the sensors were deployed in the field for more than 6 months, showing that both biofouling and drift occur during monitoring. Nonetheless, in terms of maintenance requirements, the low-cost sensor exhibited similar needs compared to the GreenSpan sensor.","[Wang, Miao; Shi, Baiqian; Catsamas, Stephen; Kolotelo, Peter] Monash Univ, Dept Civil Engn, Wellington Rd, Melbourne 3800, Australia; [McCarthy, David] Queensland Univ Technol, Sch Civil & Environm Engn, S Block,Level 7,S727, Brisbane 4000, Australia",Monash University; Queensland University of Technology (QUT),"McCarthy, D (corresponding author), Queensland Univ Technol, Sch Civil & Environm Engn, S Block,Level 7,S727, Brisbane 4000, Australia.",miao.wang@monash.edu; baiqian.shi@monash.edu; stephen.catsamas@monash.edu; peter.kolotelo@monash.edu; david.mccarthy@qut.edu.au,,,,,,,70,0,0,5,5,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,1424-8220,,SENSORS-BASEL,Sensors,JUN,2024,24,12,,,,,,,3926,10.3390/s24123926,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/s24123926,,,23,"Chemistry, Analytical; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Instruments & Instrumentation",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Chemistry; Engineering; Instruments & Instrumentation,WQ2G7,38931710.0,gold,,,2024-08-15,WOS:001256267400001,,,,710

This ""Do-It-Yourself"" interface comprised a 1.0 mx0.25 mm segment of MTX-5 metallic column and a low-cost DC power supply. Thermal desorption modulation (TDM) was attained using a dual-stage heater-based modulator in a novel segmented-loop configuration. TDM was achieved by alternating analyte trapping and thermal desorption. Former process relied on analyte partition to sorbent phase, while latter explored direct resistive heating. Introduction of an intermediate delay segment between the two stages mitigated analyte breakthrough, improving peak symmetry and chromatographic efficiency. This feature was critical to acquire reliable GCxGC modulation using such simple heater-based device. The effects of important modulation variables on 2D separations were investigated, including TDM stage length, dimension of delay loop, and outlet pressure. Significant advances and limitations of proposed TDM strategy were carefully determined. Proposed GCxGC prototype by using an in-oven TDM modulator was successfully applied to a series of challenging matrices, including petroleum distillates, biodiesel, and essential oil. This open-hardware, cost-effective modulator was easy to install and operate, as it circumvented the need for sophisticated components (e.g. moving parts and cooling systems). Therefore, our modulator is a compelling alternative to existing GCxGC solutions to operate in resource-limited laboratories.","[Mucedola, Vanessa; Vieira, Luis C.

The focus of this paper is to evaluate three ways of computing/measuring leaf temperature: the LI-COR energy budget computation, the LI-COR leaf thermocouple (T/C), and an infra-red (IR) sensor chip (MLX90615) incorporated into the LI-6400 leaf chamber. The IR-sensor was calibrated against known targets, and then used to cross check the other two methods. The results showed that the IR-sensor was superior to the LI-COR thermocouple and agreed closer with the energy budget values of leaf temperature. The magnitudes of the errors were quantified in terms of degrees C difference in leaf temperature measured by T/C (as control) and IR sensor versus percentage difference in stomatal conductance (g(s)) and intercellular CO2 concentration (C-i) computed from leaf temperature. The temperature difference (IR versus other methods) in the range of -1.89 to 1.58 degrees C resulted in relative errors in g(s) from 14.7% to -18.0% and C-i from 16.5% to -7.8% of the values reported by the standard LI-6400 calculations depending on species and temperature. Reasons are given for trusting the IR-sensor over the other methods and it is suggested that the next generation LI-COR photosynthesis system include an IR-sensor.","[Zhang, Lingling; Zhang, Sheng] Northwest A&F Univ, Coll Forestry, Yangling 712100, Shaanxi, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Sheng] Xinjiang Univ, Coll Life Sci & Technol, Urumqi 830046, Peoples R China",Northwest A&F University - China; Xinjiang University,"Zhang, S (corresponding author), Northwest A&F Univ, Coll Forestry, Yangling 712100, Shaanxi, Peoples R China.",zl524@sina.cn; 251391169@qq.com,"zhang, lingling/HDM-2189-2022",,The Recruitment program of Global Experts' grant in China [Z111021201],The Recruitment program of Global Experts' grant in China,"This work was supported by the 'The Recruitment program of Global Experts' grant in China to Melvin T.

Therefore, a microscope system's individual blur function (point spread function) is determined theoretically or by actual measurement of microbeads and processed mathematically to reduce noise and eliminate blurring as much as possible. Here the author describes the use of open-source software and open hardware design to build a deconvolution microscope at low cost, using readily available software and hardware. The advantage of this method is its cost-effectiveness and ability to construct a microscope system using commercially available optical components and open-source software. Although this system does not utilize expensive equipment, such as confocal and total internal reflection fluorescence microscopes, decent images can be obtained even without previous experience in electronics and optics.","[Katoh, Kazuo] Tsukuba Univ Technol, Fac Hlth Sci, Lab Human Anat & Cell Biol, 4-12-7 Kasuga, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3058521, Japan",Tsukuba University of Technology,"Katoh, K (corresponding author), Tsukuba Univ Technol, Fac Hlth Sci, Lab Human Anat & Cell Biol, 4-12-7 Kasuga, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3058521, Japan.",katoichi@k.tsukuba-tech.ac.jp,"Katoh, Kazuo/AAE-7893-2020","Katoh, Kazuo/0000-0002-5766-708X",,,,,26,3,3,1,10,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2313-433X,,J IMAGING,J.

In this work, we aimed to image scanned proton beams with greater flexibility than is provided by previous systems by using an innovative camera triggering solution. The main objective was to synchronize image acquisitions with proton beam deliveries. A 3D detector composed of 3 scientific complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor cameras and a volumetric liquid scintillator (20 x20x 20 cm) were used. We identified relevant signals from the synchrotron beam delivery system to trigger the cameras. These signals were processed using an open hardware microcontroller and monitored using an oscilloscope. We evaluated the camera triggering scheme by comparing the mean signal intensity and standard deviations for triggered versus non-triggered image acquisitions at 5 energies (161.6, 140.9, 124.0, 100.9, and 85.6 MeV) with 50 spots per energy. The performance of the triggering scheme was further investigated by testing the image intensity variability for 5 energies delivered at 9 different location (2 spots/location). We also measured the background signals for different exposure times (1-1000 ms) using both triggered and non-triggered schemes. The mean signal intensity difference between triggered and non-triggered schemes was 10% +/- 0.4% for low SNR (similar to 20 dB). The image intensity variability was within 2%. The background signal intensity varied by only 0.6% from the shortest exposure time (1 ms) to the longest (1 s). We demonstrated a flexible triggering scheme using an open hardware microcontroller with a camera and scintillator detector system for a spot scanning proton beam, which will enable efficient machine quality assurance and treatment plan verification measurements in the future.","[Alsanea, Fahed; Darne, Chinmay; Hojo, Yoshifumi; Beddar, Sam] Univ Texas MD Anderson Canc Ctr, Dept Radiat Phys, 1515 Holcombe Blvd,Unit 94, Houston, TX 77030 USA; [Alsanea, Fahed; Beddar, Sam] Univ Texas MD Anderson UTHlth, Grad Sch Biomed Sci, 6767 Bertner Ave, Houston, TX 77030 USA",University of Texas System; UTMD Anderson Cancer Center; University of Texas System; UTMD Anderson Cancer Center,"Beddar, S (corresponding author), Univ Texas MD Anderson Canc Ctr, Dept Radiat Phys, 1515 Holcombe Blvd,Unit 94, Houston, TX 77030 USA.",abeddar@mdanderson.org,,"Beddar, Sam/0000-0001-5825-110X; Alsanea, Fahed/0000-0001-5491-6565",National Cancer Institute of the National Institutes of Health [R01CA182450],National Cancer Institute of the National Institutes of Health(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Cancer Institute (NCI)),"The authors would like to thank Dr. Narayan Sahoo for his help with proton beam measurements, and Dr. Jim Bankson for his help with trigger equipment testing.

This application requires dedicated transmit/receive (Tx/Rx) switches that support high peak powers for MRI and high average powers for RF heating. To meet this goal, we propose a high-performance Tx/Rx switch based on positive-intrinsic-negative diodes and quarter-wavelength (lambda/4) stubs. Methods: The lambda/4 stubs in the proposed Tx/Rx switch design route the transmitted RF signal directly to the RF coil/antenna without passing through any electronic components (e.g., positive-intrinsic-negative diodes). Bench measurements, MRI, MR thermometry, and RF heating experiments were performed at f = 297 MHz (B-0 = 7 T) to examine the characteristics and applicability of the switch. Results: The proposed design provided an isolation of -235.7dB/-241.5dB during transmission/reception. The insertion loss was -20.41dB/-20.27dB during transmission/reception. The switch supports high peak (3.9 kW) and high average (120 W) RF powers for MRI and RF heating at f = 297 MHz. High-resolution MRI of the wrist yielded image quality competitive with that obtained with a conventional Tx/Rx switch. Radiofrequency heating in phantom monitored by MR thermometry demonstrated the switch applicability for thermal modulation. Upon these findings, thermally activated release of a model drug attached to thermoresponsive polymers was demonstrated. Conclusion: The high-power Tx/Rx switch enables thermal MR applications at 7 T, contributing to the study of the role of temperature in biological systems and diseases.

The robot is upgraded by providing it an artificial vision that allows obtaining the position and shape of objects collected by it. A low-cost and open-source hardware solution is also proposed to achieve motion control of the robot through a decentralized control scheme. The robot joints are actuated through five direct current motors coupled to optical encoders. Each encoder signal is fed to a proportional integral derivative controller with anti-windup that employs the motor velocity provided by a state observer. The motion controller works with only two open-architecture Arduino Mega boards, which carry out data acquisition of the optical encoder signals. MATLAB-Simulink is used to implement the controller as well as a friendly graphical interface, which allows the user to interact with the manipulator. The communication between the Arduino boards and MATLAB-Simulink is performed in real-time utilizing the Arduino IO Toolbox. Through the proposed controller, the robot follows a trajectory to collect a desired object, avoiding its collision with other objects. This fact is verified through a set of experiments presented in the paper.","[Concha Sanchez, Antonio; Felipe Figueroa-Rodriguez, Juan; Gerardo Fuentes-Covarrubias, Andres; Fuentes-Covarrubias, Ricardo] Univ Colima, Fac Ingn Mecan & Elect, Coquimatlan Colima 28400, Mexico; [Kumar Gadi, Suresh] Univ Autonoma Coahuila, Fac Ingn Mecan & Elect, Torreon 27276, Coahuila, Mexico",Universidad de Colima; Universidad Autonoma de Coahuila,"Gadi, SK (corresponding author), Univ Autonoma Coahuila, Fac Ingn Mecan & Elect, Torreon 27276, Coahuila, Mexico.",aconcha@ucol.mx; jfigueroa_@ucol.mx; fuentesg@ucol.mx; fuentesr@ucol.mx; Research@SKGadi.com,"Gadi, Suresh Kumar GSK/M-5103-2017; Concha, Antonio/U-8557-2018","Gadi, Suresh Kumar GSK/0000-0001-7974-7825; Figueroa Rodriguez, Juan Felipe/0000-0001-5528-7676; Concha, Antonio/0000-0001-9005-3584; Fuentes Covarrubias, Ricardo/0000-0001-8915-1726",Programa para el Desarrollo Profesional Docente (PRODEP-SEP),Programa para el Desarrollo Profesional Docente (PRODEP-SEP),All authors acknowledge Programa para el Desarrollo Profesional Docente (PRODEP-SEP) for supporting this research.,,46,7,7,1,9,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,1424-8220,,SENSORS-BASEL,Sensors,MAR,2020,20,6,,,,,,,1694,10.3390/s20061694,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/s20061694,,,22,"Chemistry, Analytical; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Instruments & Instrumentation",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Chemistry; Engineering; Instruments & Instrumentation,LH9YD,32197400.0,"Green Published, gold",,,2024-08-15,WOS:000529139700153,,,,717

The shot peen forming community is developing simulation and planning methods to meet the industrial need for automation. Researchers need to invest in expensive industrial robots contained in large blasting cabinets to perform the experimental validations of their proposed methods. To bypass this need for expensive industrial-grade equipment, this work presents a low-cost shot peen forming system that enables researchers to validate their methods experimentally on small samples. Conventional installations can cost a few 100,000 USD while the proposed prototype only costs 400 USD to produce. Such a prototype can operate on a tabletop with conventional electrical installations.

We present a hand-held, automatic capillary viscometer, termed Viscopette which can be fabricated simply by assembling globally available mechanical (a stepper motor and an inline pressure sensor), fluidic (a positive-displacement pipette and a cut tubing piece), electronic (an Arduino board) parts in a 3D-printed housing. The Viscopette is specifically designed to improve user experience by adopting how to use commercial micropipettes, and fits within 7.3 cm x 7.3 cm x 38.8 cm (without the cut tubing piece) with an overall weight of 437 g for portable use. By exploiting the high level of controllability of the open-source microcontroller, the Viscopettes enables time-varying shear-rate (or flow-rate) control for viscosity analysis, and simple viscosity measurement by calculating the ratio of a pressure value measured using the inline pressure sensor and a set flow-rate condition. With the advantages of easeof-use, portability, and shear-rate controllability, we demonstrate the Viscopette's ability to accurately analyze Newtonian and non-Newtonian fluids.

Based on the model and the BLE specification for spur emission, a requirement for the PLL fractional spurs is derived. To meet the derived spectral mask by reducing the fractional spurs, a novel synthesizable two-step time to digital converter (TSTDC) that employs embedded TDC (EMBTDC) as coarse and Vernier delay-line TDC (DLTDC) as fine TDC is proposed. We also present a digital calibration scheme to compensate for the nonlinearity induced by the place-and-route (P&R) tool. The PLL is fabricated in 12-nm FinFET and demonstrated in a BLE-TX. The measured BLE transmissions satisfy the standard requirements thanks to the reduced fractional spurs. In a standalone PLL mode, the proposed TSTDC and calibration scheme reduced the fractional spurs by 14.3 dB compared to only using an EMBTDC in near integer N operation. The PLL supports a frequency range of 1.8-2.7 GHz and consumes 3.91 mW at 2.4006 GHz achieving figure of merit (FoM) of -220.7 dB in fractional-N mode with a 40 MHz reference, occupying an area of 0.063 mm(2). A highly automated design flow is used for the PLL to lower the barrier for new developers and reduce the porting cost.","[Kwon, Kyumin; Abdelatty, Omar A.

A typical way to measure marine microplastic pollution involves imaging filtered seawater samples stained with a fluorescent dye to aid in the detection of microplastics. Although traditional fluorescence microscopy allows these particles to be manually counted and detected, this is a resource- and labour-intensive task. Here, we describe a novel, low-cost microscope for automated scanning and detection of microplastics in filtered seawater samples-the EnderScope. This microscope is based on the mechanics of a low-cost 3D printer (Creality Ender 3). The hotend of the printer is replaced with an optics module, allowing for the reliable and calibrated motion system of the 3D printer to be used for automated scanning over a large area (>20 x 20 cm). The EnderScope is capable of both reflected light and fluorescence imaging. In both configurations, we aimed to make the design as simple and cost-effective as possible, for example, by using low-cost LEDs for illumination and lighting gels as emission filters. We believe this tool is a cost-effective solution for microplastic measurement.

The capabilities can be extended to data taking and signal analysis at mid-level rates. Two detector realizations are presented, which cover the readouts of proportional counter tubes and of scintillators or wavelength-shifting fibers with silicon photomultipliers (SiPMs).

It consists of a custom mixed signal front-end board featuring signal amplification, discrimination and a coincidence unit for rates of up to 200 kHz. The nCatcher transforms an Arduino Nano to a proportional counter readout with pulse shape analysis: time over threshold measurement and a 10-bit analog-to-digital converter for pulse heights. The device is suitable for low-to-medium-rate environments up to 5 kHz, where a good signal-to-noise ratio is crucial. We showcase the monitoring of thermal neutrons.

First, a virtual control with nonlinear sliding manifolds is designed to achieve position-tracking capability, as well as to guarantee the fast convergence of the UAV to a desired position. Furthermore, an ultimate control is developed for the desired attitude-tracking performance. Various uncertainties, including torque due to the discordance between the centre of mass and rotation and wind disturbances are considered. The Lyapunov stability theorem is then applied step-by-step to prove the asymptotically stable and finite-time convergence in position and attitude controllers.

This high price of entry makes such technology prohibitively expensive for many research groups. Such systems stand to benefit the emerging academic pharmaceutical field by providing the experience and availability of reliable and affordable solutions. To implement accessible flow chemistry at research facilities, the systems must be made affordable. In addition, space in research laboratories is usually limited and commercially available flow systems can be very bulky. Having a compact and individually adjustable system is thus beneficial, with 3D printing technology offering the solution. Our compact 3D-printed system meets the needs of many applications in flow chemistry research as well as educational requirements for universities.

Typically, their far-field characteristics are validated in expensive, dedicated facilities such as open range sites, or anechoic chambers. Despite being necessary for obtaining high-precision data (e.g., for device qualification), the use of costly infrastructure might not be fully justified when the main goal of measurements includes demonstration of the methodology behind determination of the performance figures of interest (e.g., for the purpose of teaching), or rough validation of the EM simulation model correctness. From this perspective, systems for far-field measurements in non-anechoic environments represent an interesting alternative to the utilization of the state-of-the-art equipment and facilities. Despite their proven usefulness, the mentioned systems are normally constructed around the expensive, laboratory-grade equipment, which contradicts the whole concept of low-cost measurements. This paper discusses a cost-efficient, mobile system for experimental validation of antennas. Its main components include the in-house developed rotary heads, an open-hardware-based vector network analyzer, and the measurements post-processing software. The cost of the system amounts to only around 3630 USD. The capabilities of the device have been demonstrated through measurements of two antenna structures. The considered performance figures include radiation pattern and single-direction gain vs. frequency. Comparisons against the measurements performed in benchmark conditions (anechoic chamber), as well as using professional network analyzer have also been provided. Furthermore, the documentation that facilitates the construction of the system components is shared in an online repository.","[Olencki, Jan; Waladi, Vorya; Bekasiewicz, Adrian] Gdansk Univ Technol, Fac Elect Telecommun & Informat, Gdansk, Poland; [Leifsson, Leifur] Purdue Univ, Sch Aeronaut & Astronaut, W Lafayette, IN USA",Fahrenheit Universities; Gdansk University of Technology; Purdue University System; Purdue University,"Bekasiewicz, A (corresponding author), Gdansk Univ Technol, Fac Elect Telecommun & Informat, Gdansk, Poland.",bekasiewicz@ru.is,"Waladi, Vorya/HTS-5244-2023","Waladi, Vorya/0000-0001-9321-4427; Olencki, Jan/0009-0000-2821-4308",,,,,38,2,2,1,1,IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC,PISCATAWAY,"445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA",2169-3536,,,IEEE ACCESS,IEEE Access,,2023,11,,,,,,39165,39175,,10.1109/ACCESS.2023.3268116,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2023.3268116,,,11,"Computer Science, Information Systems; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Telecommunications",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Computer Science; Engineering; Telecommunications,F0JM4,,gold,,,2024-08-15,WOS:000979296000001,,,,728

The instrument has been designed to allow transient absorption spectroscopy measurements of either low or high quantum yield processes by combining intense sub-microsecond excitation flashes using a xenon lamp together with stroboscopic non-actinic white light probing using LED sources driven under high pulsed current from a capacitor bank. The instrument is sensitive to resolve 0.15 mOD flash-induced differences within 1000 measurements at 20 Hz repetition rate using an inexpensive CCD sensor with 200 mu m pixel dimension, 40 K electrons full well capacity and a dynamic range of 1800. The excitation flash has 230 ns pulse duration and the 2 mJ flash energy allows spectral filtering while retaining high power density with focussing to generate mOD signals in the 10(-4)-10(-1) Delta OD range.

The performance characterisation and example measurements are demonstrated using microsecond TAS of Congo red dye, as an example of a low quantum yield photoreaction at 2% with up to 78% of molecules excited. The instrument is fully open hardware and combines inexpensive selection of commercial components, optics and electronics and allows linear response measurements of photoinduced reactions for the purpose of accurate global analysis of chemical dynamics.","[Hutchison, Christopher D.

Methods: The hardware comprises a home-built 8-channel pTx system (scalable to 32-channels), wideband power amplifiers and a positioning system with submillimeter precision. The orthogonal projection (OP) method is used to mitigate RF induced tip heating and to maintain sufficientB1+for imaging. Experiments are performed at 297MHz and inside a clinical 3T MRI using 8-channel pTx RF coils, a guidewire substitute inside a phantom with attached thermistor and time-domainE-field probes. Results: Repeatability and precision are similar to 3% forE-field measurements including guidewire repositioning, similar to 3% for temperature slopes and an similar to 6% root-mean-square deviation betweenB1+measurements and simulations. Real-time pTx mitigation with the OP mode reduces theE-fields everywhere within the investigated area with a maximum reduction factor of 26 compared to the circularly polarized mode. Tip heating was measured with similar to 100 mu K resolution and similar to 14 Hz sampling frequency and showed substantial reduction for the OP vs CP mode. Conclusion: The pTx medical implant safety testbed presents a much-needed flexible and modular hardware configuration for the in-vitro assessment of implant safety, covering all field strengths from 0.5-7 T. Sensor based real-time mitigation strategies utilizing pTx and the OP method allow to substantially reduce RF induced implant heating while maintaining sufficient image quality without the need for a priori knowledge based on simulations or in-vitro testing.","[Winter, Lukas; Silemek, Berk; Petzold, Johannes; Pfeiffer, Harald; Hoffmann, Werner; Seifert, Frank; Ittermann, Bernd] Phys Tech Bundesanstalt PTB, Braunschweig, Germany; [Winter, Lukas; Silemek, Berk; Petzold, Johannes; Pfeiffer, Harald; Hoffmann, Werner; Seifert, Frank; Ittermann, Bernd] Phys Tech Bundesanstalt PTB, Berlin, Germany",Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt (PTB); Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt (PTB),"Winter, L (corresponding author), Phys Tech Bundesanstalt PTB, Biomed Magnet Resonance 8 1, Abbestr 2-12, D-10587 Berlin, Germany.",lukas.winter@ptb.de,"Silemek, Berk/Q-8425-2017","Silemek, Berk/0000-0001-8227-3632; Petzold, Johannes/0000-0001-9503-0998; Winter, Lukas/0000-0002-4381-275X",EMPIR grant [17IND01 MIMAS]; European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation program; EMPIR,EMPIR grant; European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation program(Horizon 2020); EMPIR,This work was funded by the EMPIR grant 17IND01 MIMAS.

Realizing this, we developed a fluorescence-based point-of-care (fPOC) detection system with real-time reverse transcriptase loop-mediated isothermal amplification for rapid and quantitative detection of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus. The system is built based on the Arduino platform compatible with commercially available open-source hardware-software and off-the-shelf electronic components. The fPOC system comprises of three main components: 1) an instrument with integrated heaters, 2) optical detection components, and 3) an injection-molded polymeric cartridge. The system was tested and experimentally proved to be able to use for fast detection of the SARS-CoV-2 virus in real-time in less than 30 min. Preliminary results of testing the performance of the fPOC revealed that the fPOC could detect the SARS-CoV-2 virus at a limit of detection (LOD50%) at two to three copies/microliter (15.36 copies/reaction), which was comparable to reactions run on a standard commercial thermocycler. The performance of the fPOC was evaluated with 12 SARS-CoV-2 clinical throat swab samples that included seven positive and five negative samples, as confirmed by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. The fPOC showed 100% agreement with the commercial thermocycler. This simple design of the fPOC system demonstrates the potential to greatly enhance the practical applicability to develop a totally integrated point-of-care system for rapid on-site screening of the SARS-CoV-2 virus in the management of the pandemic.","[Ngoc, Huynh Van; Quyen, Than Linh; Wolff, Anders] Tech Univ Denmark DTU Bioengn, Dept Biotechnol & Biomed, BioLabChip Grp, Lyngby, Denmark; [Vinayaka, Aaydha Chidambara; Bang, Dang Duong] Tech Univ Denmark DTU Bioengn, Dept Biotechnol & Biomed, Lab Appl Micro & Nanotechnol LAMINATE, Lyngby, Denmark",Technical University of Denmark; Technical University of Denmark,"Ngoc, HV; Wolff, A (corresponding author), Tech Univ Denmark DTU Bioengn, Dept Biotechnol & Biomed, BioLabChip Grp, Lyngby, Denmark.",vannh@dtu.dk; awol@dtu.dk,"Huynh, Van/GSM-7997-2022; Wolff, Anders/B-7601-2011","Quyen, Than Linh/0000-0002-1302-8171; Ngoc, Huynh Van/0000-0003-3093-953X; Aaydha Chidambara, Vinayaka/0000-0003-1813-4560; Wolff, Anders/0000-0001-9596-1215; Bang, Dang Duong/0000-0001-8937-687X","Department of Biotechnology and Biomedicine, Technical University of Denmark, Denmark; EU H2020; VIVALDI [101003562]; Danish government [773422];  [UFM 2,4032020]","Department of Biotechnology and Biomedicine, Technical University of Denmark, Denmark; EU H2020(Horizon 2020); VIVALDI; Danish government;","This study was supported by the Department of Biotechnology and Biomedicine, Technical University of Denmark, Denmark; two EU H2020-funded projects, CORONADX, grant no.101003562 (https://coronadx-project.eu/), and VIVALDI, grant no. 773422 (www.vivaldi-ia.eu), and the Danish government funded project COVIDTESTS (grant no.

Imaging instruments have enabled in situ observations of these organisms that can be automated and are less invasive than traditional sampling methods. However, these instruments are often costly and require sophisticated engineering expertise to operate. The In situ Plankton Assemblage eXplorer (IPAX) is an open-source low-cost imaging platform for zooplankton studies. The IPAX is a programmable instrument that has powerful LED illumination and a high-resolution camera that can image zooplankton in situ, while material costs are less than USD $450. The optical performance of the instrument was calibrated in the laboratory using a calibration target and preserved zooplankton. The IPAX was then deployed in the field to observe diversity, emergent patterns and phototactic behaviour of demersal zooplankton at night to demonstrate its practicality. Laboratory calibration indicated that the IPAX can resolve 100 mu m features with 70% contrast at the focal plane with 5 cm x 3 cm field of view and 5 mm depth of field. The instrument also resolved fine morphological details of preserved zooplankton when in focus. The field deployment demonstrated capability to resolve the myriad of zooplankton present in addition to the different phototactic behaviour that was elicited and observed from the different colour LEDs. The IPAX enables economical and autonomous surveys of zooplankton in various aquatic habitats. Its low cost facilitates construction and deployment of multiple units that can cover large spatial areas, while its versatility also allows adaptations to many experimental needs for aquatic ecology.","[Lertvilai, Pichaya] Univ Calif San Diego, Scripps Inst Oceanog, San Diego, CA 92093 USA",University of California System; University of California San Diego; Scripps Institution of Oceanography,"Lertvilai, P (corresponding author), Univ Calif San Diego, Scripps Inst Oceanog, San Diego, CA 92093 USA.",plertvil@ucsd.edu,"Lertvilai, Pichaya/HMP-4374-2023","Lertvilai, Pichaya/0000-0002-5903-1798",,,,,20,18,20,0,8,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",2041-210X,2041-2096,,METHODS ECOL EVOL,Methods Ecol.

Here we describe a high-performance, low-cost, open hardware pressure ejection system (Openspritzer), which can be constructed from off the shelf components. The device is capable of delivering minute doses of reagents to a wide range of biological and chemical systems. In this work, we characterise the performance of the device and compare it to a popular commercial system using twophoton fluorescence microscopy. We found that Openspritzer provides the same level of control over delivered reagent dose as the commercial system. Next, we demonstrate the utility of Openspritzer in a series of standard neurobiological applications. First, we used Openspritzer to deliver precise amounts of reagents to hippocampal neurons to elicit time-and dose-precise responses on neuronal voltage. Second, we used Openspritzer to deliver infectious viral and bacterial agents to living tissue. This included viral transfection of hippocampal interneurons with channelrhodopsin for the optogenetic manipulation of hippocampal circuitry with light. We anticipate that due to its high performance and low cost Openspritzer will be of interest to a broad range of researchers working in the life and physical sciences.","[Forman, C.

Since it is the most labor-intensive stage in the nearly all-analytical protocols, sample preparation automation would be desirable, to increase the analytical throughput, maintaining precision and accuracy, while preventing risks of human exposure to chemical or biological agents. Among different lab-automation strategies, robots have long been an important prospect. Nevertheless, widespread adoption of dedicate ""robot-chemist"" with analytical purposes continues being limited. Open resources that enable non-specialist analysts and researchers to make their own prototypes are still necessary. We have assembled an open-source innovative platform, able to guarantee the online hyphenation of the sample preparation microtechniques with liquid chromatography, mass spectrometry or any other detection system. It is a multi-purpose cartesian robot, programmed to perform sample clean-up operations, allowing the automated pre-concentration of analytes through the performance of solid and liquid phase microextraction protocols, actuating a microextraction syringe driver, and equipped with an in-syringe-stirring mechanism and an adapted interface for online coupling with liquid chromatography or mass spectrometry analysis. The entire sample preparation procedure can be performed by the developed prototype and the enriched extract automatically injected into the separation and detection system. The analytical performance of the developed prototype was assessed for the extraction of polyaromatic hydrocarbons from sewage water, by headspace dynamic single drop microextraction (SDME), dynamic hollow-fiber liquid phase microextraction (HF-LPME) and microextraction by packed sorbent (MEPS). The developed prototype displayed excellent precision and accuracy for the execution of the microextraction protocols, proving to be a promising and competitive open source analytical tool able to extend the state-of-the-art of sample preparation microtechniques.

In this work, a low cost data acquisition system (Geophonino) has been developed for recording seismic signals from a vertical geophone. The signal goes first through an instrumentation amplifier, INA155, which is suitable for low amplitude signals like the seismic noise, and an anti-aliasing filter based on the MAX7404 switched-capacitor filter. After that, the amplified and filtered signal is digitized and processed by Arduino Due and registered in an SD memory card. Geophonino is configured for continuous registering, where the sampling frequency, the amplitude gain and the registering time are user-defined. The complete prototype is an open source and open hardware system. It has been tested by comparing the registered signals with the ones obtained through different commercial data recording systems and different kind of geophones. The obtained results show good correlation between the tested measurements, presenting Geophonino as a low-cost alternative system for seismic data recording. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

The optical rotation angle is determined by measuring the phase difference between two harmonically modulated polarised laser beams - an 'object beam' that passes through the sample under test and a 'reference beam' that bypasses the sample. The complete polarimeter may be assembled from low cost off-the-shelf parts for less than 300 pound (UK Sterling). Data acquisition and analysis are carried out on a microcontroller running an efficient algorithm based on the sliding Discrete Fourier Transform. Despite its low cost, the polarimeter is a fully automatic, research-grade instrument with an accuracy of +/- 0.0013 degrees and a precision of +/- 0.0028 degrees - comparable to far costlier commercial instruments. The polarimeter's ease of use, compact size, fast measurement times and high angular resolution make it a capable and versatile tool for analytical science, while its low cost means it is ideally suited for use in resource-constrained environments and process monitoring. The polarimeter is released here as open hardware, with technical diagrams, a full parts list, and source code for its firmware included as Supplementary Information.","[Harvie, A. J.; deMello, J.

The necessity of including non-safety capabilities to reduce the price of these systems has resulted in a new type of critical systems, the mixed-criticality ones. These systems should be able to execute safety-critical applications but, at the same time, to run non-safety-critical functionalities without affecting the integrity of the safetycritical tasks. This paper presents a new system architecture which includes safetycritical and non-safety-critical parts in order to form a mixed-criticality system. The system consists of a reliable platform with a dual-core processor (implemented using a FPGA) architecture designed as open-hardware, running two isolated real-time operating systems which are connected through a safe core-to-core communication channel that executes the safety-critical applications. Moreover, the safety-critical system is connected to an external processor, an ARM9, which is used as an external sensing system. The ARM9 runs the non-safety-critical applications and allows the system to insert modifications updating without affecting the safety capabilities of the safetycritical part. This platform is described providing evidences of the isolation between safety-critical (SC) and non-safety-critical (NSC) applications, as well as describing an updating methodology for non-safety-critical applications. This system is validated using a complete and reliable application for safe emergency stop applications for industrial machinery.","[Luis Gutierrez-Rivas, Jose; Diaz-Alonso, Javier] Univ Granada, Granada, Spain; [Holmbacka, Simon; Lund, Wictor; Lafond, Sebastien; Lilius, Johan] Abo Akad Univ, Turku, Finland; [Mendez-Macias, Miguel] Seven Solut Inc, Granada, Spain",University of Granada; Abo Akademi University,"Gutiérrez-Rivas, JL (corresponding author), Univ Granada, Granada, Spain.",jlgutierrez@ugr.es; sholmbac@abo.fi; mmendez@sevensols.com; wictor.lund@abo.fi; sebastien.lafond@abo.fi; Johan.Lilius@abo.fi; jda@ugr.es,"Gutiérrez Rivas, José Luis/A-6662-2016; Lafond, Sébastien/F-1891-2010; Lilius, Johan/P-7269-2019; Diaz, Javier/C-2387-2012","Lafond, Sébastien/0000-0002-5286-5343; Lilius, Johan/0000-0002-9176-2881; Diaz, Javier/0000-0002-1849-8068",Andalusian Excellence Project VITVIR [TIC-8120],Andalusian Excellence Project VITVIR,"This work has been supported by the Andalusian Excellence Project VITVIR (grant number TIC-8120).

In most of these instruments, sample injection is effected manually with low to moderate precision and requires skilled operators. Although few automated samplers have been previously developed, typically only one sample at a time can be injected. If a series of samples is to be analyzed, manual intervention is required. In the present work, we developed and constructed a fully automated, open source, CE autosampler, able to handle up to 14 different samples that can be used as a modular component of any in-house built CE instrument. Results: An inexpensive, 3D printed, open source, autosampler for CE was developed. The autosampler consists of two parts: an injection unit with carousel containing sample and electrolyte vials and a flushing unit, containing a miniature pressure/vacuum pump. The autosampler is operated by an Arduino Mega microcontroller and an Arduino code written in the laboratory. The injection sequence is entered through a keypad and LCD display by the user. The instrument can operate autonomously for extended periods of time. It was used for fully automated analysis and/or calibration of up to 14 samples with excellent injection repeatability reaching less than 2.7% RSD for peak areas. The sampler performance was tested with two independently built CE instruments, a CE system with contactless conductivity detection (C4D) and a CE system with laser induced fluorescence (LIF) detector.Significance and novelty: A novel, 3D printed, Arduino-based autosampler for CE was developed. The autosampler allows autonomous hydrodynamic injection of up to 14 different samples with fully programmable injection sequence, including capillary flushing and high voltage and data acquisition control. It provides the missing instrumental sampling setup for laboratory made CE instruments. It can be simply constructed based on the open -source blueprints in any laboratory and be a useful and time-saving add-on to any modular CE instrument.","[Itterheimova, Petra; Kuban, Petr] Acad Sci Czech Republ, Inst Analyt Chem, Dept Bioanalyt Instrumentat, Veveri 97, Brno 60200, Czech Republic; [Itterheimova, Petra] CEITEC Masaryk Univ, Kamenice 5, Brno 62500, Czech Republic",Czech Academy of Sciences; Institute of Analytical Chemistry of the Czech Academy of Sciences; Masaryk University Brno,"Kubán, P (corresponding author), Acad Sci Czech Republ, Inst Analyt Chem, Dept Bioanalyt Instrumentat, Veveri 97, Brno 60200, Czech Republic.",,,"Itterheimova, Petra/0000-0002-1203-5441; Kuban, Petr/0000-0002-4056-5570",Czech Science Foundation [22-23815S],Czech Science Foundation(Grant Agency of the Czech Republic),Martin Kuban is acknowledged for his help with writing the Arduino code.

MRI magnets can be constructed based on permanent neodymium-iron-boron (NdFeB) magnets in discretized arrangements, leading to substantially lower mass and costs. A challenge with these designs is, however, a good B-0 field homogeneity, which is needed to produce high quality images free of distortions. In this work, we describe an iterative approach to build a low-field MR magnet based on a B-0-shimming methodology using genetic algorithms. The methodology is tested by constructing a small bore (inner bore diameter = 130 mm) desktop MR magnet (<15 kg) at a field strength of B-0 = 0.1 T and a target volume of 4 cm in diameter. The configuration consists of a base magnet and shim inserts, which can be placed iteratively without modifying the base magnet assembly and without changing the inner dimensions of the bore or the outer dimensions of the MR magnet. Applying the shims, B0 field inhomogeneity could be reduced by a factor 8 from 5,448 to 682 ppm in the target central slice of the magnet. Further improvements of these results can be achieved in a second or third iteration, using more sensitive magnetic field probes (e.g., nuclear magnetic resonance based magnetic field measurements). The presented methodology is scalable to bigger magnet designs. The MR magnet can be reproduced with off-the-shelf components and a 3D printer and no special tools are needed for construction. All design files and code to reproduce the results will be made available as open source hardware.","[Wenzel, Konstantin; Alhamwey, Hazem; Riemann, Layla Tabea; Silemek, Berk; Winter, Lukas] Phys Tech Bundesanstalt PTB, Berlin, Germany; [Wenzel, Konstantin; Alhamwey, Hazem; Riemann, Layla Tabea; Silemek, Berk; Winter, Lukas] Phys Tech Bundesanstalt PTB, Braunschweig, Germany; [O'Reilly, Tom] Leiden Univ, Dept Radiol, CJ Gorter Ctr High Field MRI, Med Ctr, Leiden, Netherlands",Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt (PTB); Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt (PTB); Leiden University - Excl LUMC; Leiden University; Leiden University Medical Center (LUMC),"Winter, L (corresponding author), Phys Tech Bundesanstalt PTB, Berlin, Germany.; Winter, L (corresponding author), Phys Tech Bundesanstalt PTB, Braunschweig, Germany.",lukas.winter@ptb.de,"Silemek, Berk/Q-8425-2017","Silemek, Berk/0000-0001-8227-3632; Winter, Lukas/0000-0002-4381-275X",,,,,38,6,6,2,22,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,LAUSANNE,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",2296-424X,,,FRONT PHYS-LAUSANNE,Front.

Preparative liquid chromatography was implemented with a reverse phase gradient from MeOH to toluene. The system allows three solvents and fractions changes by using quaternary valves connected to an Arduino microcontroller, programmed on the basis of the absorbance signal measured and its first derivative. Additionally, the method was applied to crude oils (Venezuelan National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) 8505 and from a marine reservoir). V and Ni were determined by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) and the V-porphyrin profile was determined by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC)-ICP-MS. The concentrations of the metals grow in the last eluting toluene fractions, associated with asphaltenes. On the other hand, V-porphyrins in the first eluting MeOH fractions showed profiles of labile compounds, with a higher percentage in the Brazilian crude oil (4.9 mg L-1, corresponding to 18% of total V), in comparison to the one from the biodegraded NIST 8505 (59 mg L-1, corresponding to 7% of total V). The overall methodology has a good reproducibility and provides information on elements concentrations associated with porphyrin class compounds.","[Silva, Daniel M.; Pereira, Alvaro J.; Saint'Pierre, Tatiana D.] Pontificia Univ Catolica Rio de Janeiro PUG Rio, R Marques de Sao Vicente 225, BR-22451900 Rio De Janeiro, RJ, Brazil; [Esteves, Pierre M.] Univ Fed Rio de Janeiro UFRJ, Inst Quim, BR-21941909 Rio De Janeiro, RJ, Brazil; [Rocha, Anderson A.; Duyck, Christiane] Univ Fed Fluminense, Dept Quim Analit, Outeiro Sao Joao Batista S-N, BR-24020141 Niteroi, RJ, Brazil; [Escalfoni Jr, Rainerio] Petrobras SA, Ctr Pesquisa Leopoldo Americo Miguez de Mello Cen, Av Jequitiba 950, BR-21941598 Rio De Janeiro, RJ, Brazil",Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro; Universidade Federal Fluminense; Petrobras,"Esteves, PM (corresponding author), Univ Fed Rio de Janeiro UFRJ, Inst Quim, BR-21941909 Rio De Janeiro, RJ, Brazil.; Duyck, C (corresponding author), Univ Fed Fluminense, Dept Quim Analit, Outeiro Sao Joao Batista S-N, BR-24020141 Niteroi, RJ, Brazil.",pesteves@iq.ufrj.br; cbduyck@id.uff.br,"Silva, Duílio M Z A/E-9013-2014; Rocha, Anderson/KHU-9621-2024; Rocha, Anderson/ABA-8662-2020; Saint'Pierre, Tatiana Dillenburg/E-2965-2015; Duyck, Christiane/AEJ-1818-2022; Esteves, Pierre Mothe/G-3132-2011","Rocha, Anderson/0000-0001-5179-1146; Duyck, Christiane/0000-0002-2837-4173; Saint Pierre, Tatiana/0000-0002-7619-5620; Esteves, Pierre Mothe/0000-0001-6048-4690",Brazilian Petroleum Company (Petrobras); Brazilian National Research Council (CNPq),Brazilian Petroleum Company (Petrobras)(Petrobras); Brazilian National Research Council (CNPq)(Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPQ)),"The authors thank the Brazilian Petroleum Company (Petrobras) for the funding and in particular Flavio Albuquerque, Marco Antonio Teixeira and Rosana Cardoso, for the valuable contributions in porphyrins separation.

An anomaly in the biomedical context has an obvious diagnostic implication. The first step in this time-series-to-network (T2N) approach is to partition the signal intensity in q user-defined intervals where, qMUCH LESS-THANN, N being the number of discrete sampling points of the time series. This maps the time series into a multigraph GM, the state transition between different signal partitions serving as directed edges E of the graph GM(V,E), q being the cardinality of the vertex set V. Eventually, GM may have self-loops. Next, GM is split into a simple graph G = G(V,H),with edge-set H devoid of self-loops and three sets of parameters, namely, node strength index (NSI), interaction strength ratio (AISR), self-loop weights. The order of computational tasks reduces from O(N) to O(3q) with qMUCH LESS-THANN. Using such decomposition, we have performed beat classification of ECG data collected from MIT BIH repository. The network derived feature sets enables us to drastically compress the training set size. We next show how a simple neural MLP model with a single hidden layer with similar to 100 neurons is able to learn to classify normal and abnormal single beats with good precision and recall scores. The results showcase the possibility of performing anomaly detection in bio-signals with an algorithm exhibiting low computational complexity, showing the promise of implementation on low cost IoT hardware devices integrated with modern digital data acquisition systems for bedside patient monitoring.","[Mandyam, Sridhar K.] Int Inst Informat Technol Bengaluru, Ctr Appl Data Sci, Bengaluru 560100, Karnataka, India; [Dasgupta, Anjan Kr] Univ Calcutta, Dept Biochem, 35 Ballygunge Circular Rd, Kolkata 700019, India; [Sridhar, Usha] Ecometrix Res, Bengaluru 560078, India; [Dasgupta, Panini] Univ Calcutta, Dept Atmospher Sci, Kolkata, W Bengal, India; [Chakrabarti, Amlan] Calcutta Univ, AK Choudhury Sch IT, Technol Campus,JD 2,Sect 3, Kolkata 700098, India; [Dasgupta, Panini] Indian Inst Trop Meteorol, Pashan Rd, Pune 411008, Maharashtra, India",International Institute of Information Technology Bangalore (IIIT Bangalore); University of Calcutta; University of Calcutta; University of Calcutta; Ministry of Earth Sciences (MoES) - India; Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology (IITM),"Dasgupta, AK (corresponding author), Univ Calcutta, Dept Biochem, 35 Ballygunge Circular Rd, Kolkata 700019, India.",sridhar.mandyamk@iiith.ac.in; adbioc@caluniv.ac.in; usha.sridhar@ecometrix.in; panini.dasgupta@tropmet.res.in; acakcs@caluniv.ac.in,"Chakrabarti, Amlan/U-7020-2019; Dasgupta., Panini/GYJ-5093-2022","Chakrabarti, Amlan/0000-0003-4380-3172;",MeitY [13(10)/2016-ccBT 18/7/17],MeitY,"The authors thank MeitY Sanction No. 13(10)/2016-cc&BT & 18/7/17 for the project entitled ""Open Hardware Based Communicable Digital Bio-Sensing Platform.""",,31,0,0,0,8,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",1746-8094,1746-8108,,BIOMED SIGNAL PROCES,Biomed.

As we gain more insight into the genomic basis of pathogen infectivity and drug resistance, point-of-care nucleic acid testing will likely become an important tool for global health. In this paper, we present an inexpensive, handheld, battery-powered instrument designed to enable pathogen genotyping in the developing world. Our Microfluidic Biomolecular Amplification Reader (mBAR) represents the convergence of molecular biology, microfluidics, optics, and electronics technology. The mBAR is capable of carrying out isothermal nucleic acid amplification assays with real-time fluorescence readout at a fraction of the cost of conventional benchtop thermocyclers. Additionally, the mBAR features cell phone data connectivity and GPS sample geotagging which can enable epidemiological surveying and remote healthcare delivery. The mBAR controls assay temperature through an integrated resistive heater and monitors real-time fluorescence signals from 60 individual reaction chambers using LEDs and phototransistors. Assays are carried out on PDMS disposable microfluidic cartridges which require no external power for sample loading. We characterize the fluorescence detection limits, heater uniformity, and battery life of the instrument. As a proof-of-principle, we demonstrate the detection of the HIV-1 integrase gene with the mBAR using the Loop-Mediated Isothermal Amplification (LAMP) assay. Although we focus on the detection of purified DNA here, LAMP has previously been demonstrated with a range of clinical samples, and our eventual goal is to develop a microfluidic device which includes on-chip sample preparation from raw samples. The mBAR is based entirely around open source hardware and software, and in the accompanying online supplement we present a full set of schematics, bill of materials, PCB layouts, CAD drawings, and source code for the mBAR instrument with the goal of spurring further innovation toward low-cost genetic diagnostics.","[Myers, Frank B.; Henrikson, Richard H.; Lee, Luke P.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Bioengn, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Myers, Frank B.; Henrikson, Richard H.; Lee, Luke P.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Berkeley Sensor & Actuator Ctr, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Bone, Jennifer] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Phys, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA",University of California System; University of California Berkeley; University of California System; University of California Berkeley; University of California System; University of California Berkeley,"Lee, LP (corresponding author), Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Bioengn, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",lplee@berkeley.edu,"Lee, Luke P/AAN-6695-2021",,DSO of Defense Advanced Research Project Agency (DxOD project); Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation; NDSEG; Siebel Scholarship,DSO of Defense Advanced Research Project Agency (DxOD project); Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation(Bill & Melinda Gates FoundationBill & Melinda Gates Foundation Grand Challenges Explorations InitiativeCGIAR); NDSEG; Siebel Scholarship,"This work was supported by the DSO of Defense Advanced Research Project Agency (DxOD project) and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation (Grand Challenges).

Furthermore, because ELISA requires relatively large sample volumes and protein concentrations, it is difficult using this technique to determine protein content for multiple cytokines from individual samples. Recently, Luminex has developed an open source hardware platform combining flow cytometry- and bead-based antibody capture that is capable of detecting multiple analytes from a single sample. In the present study we employed the Luminex 2000 platform to determine the cytokine protein content in discrete brain regions of C57BL/6J mice. In spike-and-recovery experiments, known concentrations of murine recombinant interleukin (IL)-1, 1 beta, IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)alpha were added either singly or as a mixture of all three to whole brain homogenates containing known quantities of total protein. Spiked samples were assayed for either a single cytokine or for multiple cytokines using 1-plex or 3-plex assay kits, respectively. In whole mouse brain homogenate we recovered between 81% and 103% of the recombinant cytokines. We then injected C57BL/6J mice intraperitoneally with bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and sacrificed them 4 h later. We detected in samples taken from LPS-stimulated mice 4- to 870-fold increases in serum or spleen cytokine protein, and 1.5- to 16-fold increases in cytokine protein in discrete brain regions, relative to protein content in samples obtained from vehicle-treated animals. These results indicate that multiple cytokines may be reliably assayed from discrete regions of mouse brain using a single sample. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Anion-exchange membranes provide an alkaline environment, allowing CO2 reduction at low cell voltages and suppression of hydrogen evolution while maintaining high conversion efficiencies. However, the local alkaline conditions and the presence of alkali cations lead to problematic carbonate formation and even precipitation. Here we report a pure-water-fed (alkali-cation-free) membrane-electrode-assembly system for CO2 reduction to ethylene by integrating an anion-exchange membrane and a proton-exchange membrane at the cathode and anode side, respectively, under forward bias. This system effectively suppresses carbonate formation and prevents salt precipitation. A scaled-up electrolyser stack achieved over 1,000 h stability without CO2 and electrolyte losses and with 50% Faradaic efficiency towards ethylene at a total current of 10 A.","[She, Xiaojie; Zhai, Lingling; Xiong, Pei; Li, Molly Meng-Jung; Wong, Man Chung; Guo, Xuyun; Xu, Zhihang; Zhu, Ye; Lau, Shu Ping] Hong Kong Polytech Univ, Res Inst Smart Energy, Dept Appl Phys, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Wang, Yifei; Tsang, Shik Chi Edman] Univ Oxford, Wolfson Catalysis Ctr, Dept Chem, Oxford, England; [Wu, Tai-Sing] Natl Synchrotron Radiat Res Ctr, Hsinchu, Taiwan; [Li, Huaming; Xu, Hui] Jiangsu Univ, Inst Energy Res, Sch Environm & Safety Engn, Zhenjiang, Peoples R China",Hong Kong Polytechnic University; University of Oxford; National Synchrotron Radiation Research Center; Jiangsu University,"Zhu, Y; Lau, SP (corresponding author), Hong Kong Polytech Univ, Res Inst Smart Energy, Dept Appl Phys, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.; Tsang, SCE (corresponding author), Univ Oxford, Wolfson Catalysis Ctr, Dept Chem, Oxford, England.; Xu, H (corresponding author), Jiangsu Univ, Inst Energy Res, Sch Environm & Safety Engn, Zhenjiang, Peoples R China.",xh@ujs.edu.cn; yezhu@polyu.edu.hk; edman.tsang@chem.ox.ac.uk; apsplau@polyu.edu.hk,"Li, Molly/KHV-3262-2024; Lau, Shu Ping/A-6083-2008; Xu, Hui/ADN-0578-2022; Wang, Yifei/IWD-7349-2023; huaming, li/S-1885-2016; Zhu, Ye/A-1844-2011","Lau, Shu Ping/0000-0002-5315-8472; Xu, Hui/0000-0002-2823-5915; Wang, Yifei/0000-0002-2285-2357; Wu, Tai-Sing/0000-0002-3285-7258; Zhu, Ye/0000-0002-5217-493X; Xiong, Pei/0000-0001-6023-312X; Xu, Zhihang/0000-0001-9674-3439","Research Grants Council, University Grants Committee (RGC, UGC); Research Grants Council of Hong Kong [1-CD7U, 1-YXA0]; Hong Kong Polytechnic University [22108109, 22178152]; National Natural Science Foundation of China","Research Grants Council, University Grants Committee (RGC, UGC); Research Grants Council of Hong Kong(Hong Kong Research Grants Council); Hong Kong Polytechnic University(Hong Kong Polytechnic University); National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC))","We thank the National Synchrotron Radiation Center, Hsinchu, Taiwan, for the use of beamline BL01C.

The end user receives the information from the analyzer via text messages (SMS), a service available even in rural and less developed areas, and requiring simple (non-smart) cell phones. The linear range was up to 25 mg L-1 P for phosphate, up to 1600 mu g L-1 N-NO2- for nitrite, and up to 2500 mu g L-1 N-NO3- for nitrite plus nitrate. The detection limits for each analyte were 0.28 mg L-1 P for phosphate, 19 mu g L-1 N-NO2- for nitrite and 26 mu g L-1 N NO3- fornitrite plus nitrate.

ROACH is an open-source hardware and software platform featuring a large Xilinx Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA), Power PC processor, several 10 GB Ethernet SFP+ interfaces, and a collection of daughter boards for analog signal generation and acquisition. The combination of a ROACH board, ADC/DAC conversion daughter boards, and hardware for RF mixing allows for the generation and capture of multiple RF tones for reading out microwave multiplexed X-ray TES microcalorimeters. The FPGA is used to generate multiple tones in base band, from 10 MHz to 250 MHz, which are subsequently mixed to RF in the multiple GHz range and sent through the microwave multiplexer. The tones are generated in theFPGAby storing a large lookup table in Quad Data Rate SRAM modules and playing out the waveform to a DAC board. Once the signal has been modulated to RF, passed through the microwave multiplexer, and has been modulated back to base band, the signal is digitized by an ADC board. The tones are modulated to 0 Hz by using a FPGA circuit consisting of a polyphase filter bank, several Xilinx FFT blocks, Xilinx CORDIC blocks (for converting to magnitude and phase), and special phase accumulator circuit for mixing to exactly 0 Hz. Upwards of 256 channels can be simultaneously captured and written into a bank of 256 First-In-First-Out (FIFO) memories, with each FIFO corresponding to a channel. Individual channel data can be further processed in the FPGA before being streamed through a 10 GB Ethernet fiber-optic interface to a Linux system. The Linux system runs software written in Python and QT C++ for controlling the ROACH system, capturing data, and processing data.","[Madden, Timothy J.; Cecil, Thomas W.; Gades, Lisa M.; Quaranta, Orlando; Yan, Daikang; Miceli, Antonino] Argonne Natl Lab, 9700 S Cass Ave, Argonne, IL 60439 USA; [Yan, Daikang] Northwestern Univ, Evanston, IL 60208 USA; [Becker, Dan T.; Bennett, Doug A.; Hays-Wehle, James P.; Hilton, Gene C.; Reintsema, Carl D.; Schmidt, Dan R.; Swetz, Daniel S.; Vale, Leila R.; Ullom, Joel N.] NIST, Boulder, CO 80305 USA; [Becker, Dan T.; Gard, Johnathon D.; Mates, John A.

Increased specimen thickness degrades resolution with beam broadening alongside loss of contrast. The large inelastic cross-section of carbon hampers accurate atomic species detection. Oxygen and water molecules pose problems of lattice damage by chemically etching the specimen during imaging. These constraints on high-resolution and spectroscopic imaging demand clean, high-vacuum microscopes with dry pumps. Here, we present an open-hardware design of a high-vacuum manifold for transmission electron microscopy (TEM) holders to mitigate hydrocarbon and residual species exposure. We quantitatively show that TEM holders are inherently dirty and introduce a range of unwanted chemical species. Overnight storage in our manifold reduces contaminants by one to two orders of magnitude and promotes two to four times faster vacuum recovery. A built-in bakeout system further reduces contaminants partial pressure to below 10(-10 )hPa (Torr) (approximately four orders of magnitude down from ambient storage) and alleviates monolayer adsorption during a typical TEM experiment. We determine that bakeout of TEM holder with specimen held therein is the optimal cleaning method. Our high-vacuum manifold design is published with open-source blueprints, parts, and cost list.","[Goh, Yin Min] Univ Michigan, Dept Phys, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Schwartz, Jonathan; Hovden, Robert] Univ Michigan, Dept Mat Sci & Engn, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Rennich, Emily] Univ Michigan, Dept Mech Engn, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Ma, Tao] Univ Michigan, Michigan Ctr Mat Characterizat, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Kerns, Bobby; Hovden, Robert] Univ Michigan, Appl Phys Program, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA",University of Michigan System; University of Michigan; University of Michigan System; University of Michigan; University of Michigan System; University of Michigan; University of Michigan System; University of Michigan; University of Michigan System; University of Michigan,"Hovden, R (corresponding author), Univ Michigan, Dept Mat Sci & Engn, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA.; Hovden, R (corresponding author), Univ Michigan, Appl Phys Program, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA.",hovden@umich.edu,"ma, tao/JTS-7892-2023; Hovden, Robert/E-8104-2011","Goh, Yin Min/0000-0003-3692-8372; Schwartz, Jonathan/0000-0002-8063-6951; Rennich, Emily/0000-0002-9147-4708; Kerns, Robert/0009-0006-2824-6258",National Science Foundation (NSF) [18073984],National Science Foundation (NSF)(National Science Foundation (NSF)),"The authors recognize support and inspiration from other facilities with custom in-house TEM manifolds-Cornell University (Malcolm Thomas, Lena F.

This is particularly challenging in small animal MRI, as higher heart rates combined with a smaller myocardial mass render routine ECG detection challenging. We have developed an open-hardware system that enables continuously running MRI scans to be performed in conjunction with cardio-respiratory gating such that the relaxation-weighted steady state magnetisation is maintained throughout the scan. This requires that the R-wave must be detected reliably even in the presence of rapidly switching gradients, and that data previously acquired that were corrupted by respiratory motion reacquired. The accurately maintained steady-state magnetisation leads to an improvement in image quality and removes alterations in intensity that may otherwise occur throughout the cardiac cycle and impact upon automated image analysis. We describe the hardware required to enable this and demonstrate its application and robust performance using prospectively cardio-respiratory gated CINE imaging that is operated at a single, constant TR.

The widespread availability of open-source hardware together with novel analytical methods based on pulsed flows have opened the possibility of implementing standalone automated analytical systems at low cost. Among the areas that can benefit from this approach are the analysis of industrial products and effluents and environmental analysis. In this work, a multi-pumping flow system is proposed for the determination of phosphorus in effluents and polluted water samples. The system employs photometric detection based on the formation of molybdovanadophosphoric acid, and the fluidic circuit is built using three solenoid micropumps. The detection is implemented with a low cost LED-photodiode photometric detection system and the whole system is controlled by an open-source Arduino Uno microcontroller board. The optimization of the timing to ensure the color development and the pumping cycle is discussed for the proposed implementation. Experimental results to evaluate the system behavior are presented verifying a linear relationship between the relative absorbance and the phosphorus concentrations for levels as high as 50 mg L-1.","[Gonzalez, Pablo; Knochen, Moises] Univ La Republ, Fac Quim, Quim Analit, Montevideo 11800, Uruguay; [Perez, Nicolas] Univ La Republ, Ctr Univ Paysandu, Ruta 3 Km 363, Paysandu 60000, Uruguay","Universidad de la Republica, Uruguay; Universidad de la Republica, Uruguay","Knochen, M (corresponding author), Univ La Republ, Fac Quim, Quim Analit, Montevideo 11800, Uruguay.",mknochen@fq.edu.uy,"Alvarez, Nicolas/GWQ-8755-2022","Knochen, Moises/0000-0001-9263-7428; Perez, Nicolas/0000-0002-8043-5383",Programa de Desarrollo de Ciencias Basicas (PEDECIBA); Agencia Nacional de Investigacion e Innovacion (ANII); Universidad de la Republica (UdelaR),Programa de Desarrollo de Ciencias Basicas (PEDECIBA); Agencia Nacional de Investigacion e Innovacion (ANII); Universidad de la Republica (UdelaR),The authors thank Programa de Desarrollo de Ciencias Basicas (PEDECIBA) for support.

In this paper, a modular hardware platform allowing to prototype, test and even implement IoT appliances on low-cost reconfigurable devices is presented. The proposed platform, named Dracon, includes a Z80-clone microprocessor, up to 64 KB of RAM, and 256 inputs/outputs (I/Os). These I/Os can be used to connect additional co-processors within the same FPGA, external co-processors, communications modules, sensors and actuators. Dracon also includes as default peripherals a UART for programming and accessing the microprocessor, a Real Time Clock, and an Interrupt Timer. The use of an 8-bit microprocessor allows the use of the internal memory of the reconfigurable device as program memory, thereby, enabling the implementation of a complete IoT device within a single low-cost chip. Indeed, results using a Spartan 7 FPGA show that it is possible to implement Dracon with only 1515 6-input LUTs while operating at a maximum frequency of 80 MHz, which results in a better trade-off in terms of area and performance than other less powerful and less versatile alternatives in the literature. Moreover, the presented platform allows the development of embedded software applications independently of the selected FPGA device, enabling rapid prototyping and implementations on devices from different manufacturers.","[Parrilla, Luis; Garcia, Antonio; Castillo, Encarnacion; Lopez-Villanueva, Juan Antonio] Univ Granada, Dept Elect & Tecnol Comp, Granada 18071, Spain; [Alvarez-Bermejo, Jose Antonio] Univ Almeria, Dept Informat, Almeria 04120, Spain; [Meyer-Baese, Uwe] FAMU FSU Coll Engn, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, Tallahassee, FL 32310 USA",University of Granada; Universidad de Almeria; State University System of Florida; Florida State University; Florida A&M University,"Parrilla, L (corresponding author), Univ Granada, Dept Elect & Tecnol Comp, Granada 18071, Spain.",lparrilla@ditec.ugr.es; grios@ugr.es; encas@ugr.es; jaberme@ual.es; jalopez@ugr.es; umb@eng.famu.fsu.edu,"Castillo, Encarnación/ACP-5061-2022; Castillo, Encarnacion/D-9975-2012; García, Antonio/C-6070-2012; Parrilla Roure, Luis/C-2439-2012; Meyer-Baese, Uwe/L-7388-2014; Lopez Villanueva, Juan A./C-2418-2012; Alvarez Bermejo, Jose Antonio/M-1691-2014","Castillo, Encarnación/0000-0001-6476-8105; Castillo, Encarnacion/0000-0001-6476-8105; García, Antonio/0000-0003-3533-4660; Parrilla Roure, Luis/0000-0001-8126-1146; Meyer-Baese, Uwe/0000-0001-8130-9963; Lopez Villanueva, Juan A./0000-0003-0334-0863; Alvarez Bermejo, Jose Antonio/0000-0002-5815-7858",Consejeria de Economia y Conocimiento de la Junta de Andalucia (Spain); European Regional Development Funds (ERDF) [B-TIC-588-UGR20],Consejeria de Economia y Conocimiento de la Junta de Andalucia (Spain)(Junta de Andalucia); European Regional Development Funds (ERDF)(European Union (EU)),This work was partially supported by the Consejeria de Economia y Conocimiento de la Junta de Andalucia (Spain) and by the European Regional Development Funds (ERDF) under Project B-TIC-588-UGR20.,,61,3,3,3,8,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2079-9292,,ELECTRONICS-SWITZ,Electronics,JUL,2022,11,13,,,,,,,2080,10.3390/electronics11132080,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/electronics11132080,,,18,"Computer Science, Information Systems; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Physics, Applied",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Computer Science; Engineering; Physics,2V2FF,,"Green Submitted, Green Published, gold",,,2024-08-15,WOS:000823665600001,1,,0,764

Aiming to provide the basic concepts of hardware and software, this article is focused on the design and use of a simple module to control a series of PDMS-based valves. The module is based on a low-cost microprocessor (Teensy) and open-source software (Arduino). The microvalves were fabricated using thin sheets of PDMS and patterned using CO2 laser engraving, providing a simple and efficient way to fabricate devices without the traditional photolithographic process or facilities. Synchronization of valve control enabled the development of two simple devices to perform injection (1.6 +/- 0.4 mu L/stroke) and mixing of different solutions. Furthermore, a practical demonstration of the utility of this system for microscale chemical sample handling and analysis was achieved performing an on-chip acid-base titration, followed by conductivity detection with an open-source low-cost detection system. Overall, the system provided a very reproducible (98%) platform to perform fluid delivery at the microfluidic scale.","[da Costa, Eric Tavares; Garcia, Carlos D.] Univ Texas San Antonio, Dept Chem, San Antonio, TX 78248 USA; [da Costa, Eric Tavares; do Lago, Claudimir L.] Univ Sao Paulo, Dept Quim Fundamental, Inst Quim, Sao Paulo, Brazil; [Mora, Maria F.; Willis, Peter A.] CALTECH, Jet Prop Lab, Pasadena, CA USA; [Jiao, Hong] HJ Sci & Technol, Berkeley, CA USA",University of Texas System; University of Texas at San Antonio (UTSA); Universidade de Sao Paulo; National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA); NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL); California Institute of Technology,"Garcia, CD (corresponding author), Univ Texas San Antonio, Dept Chem, One UTSA Circle, San Antonio, TX 78248 USA.",carlos.garcia@utsa.edu,"do Lago, Claudimir Lucio/A-1852-2008; Mora, Maria Fernanda/C-9753-2009; Garcia, Carlos/A-8681-2008; Mora, Maria Fernanda/T-5832-2019; Willis, Peter Athol/I-6621-2012; da Costa, Eric tavares/D-5387-2012","do Lago, Claudimir Lucio/0000-0003-1542-4343; Garcia, Carlos/0000-0002-7583-5585; Willis, Peter Athol/0000-0001-5394-1101; da Costa, Eric tavares/0000-0003-4489-3501; Mora, Maria/0000-0002-6341-8485",NASA STTR [NNX13CP49C]; University of Texas at San Antonio; National Institutes of Health through the Research Centers at Minority Institutions [G12MD007591],NASA STTR; University of Texas at San Antonio; National Institutes of Health through the Research Centers at Minority Institutions,"The authors gratefully acknowledge the financial support provided by NASA STTR (Contract number: NNX13CP49C), The University of Texas at San Antonio, and the National Institutes of Health through the Research Centers at Minority Institutions (G12MD007591).",,49,39,48,1,101,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0173-0835,1522-2683,,ELECTROPHORESIS,Electrophoresis,AUG,2014,35,16,,,SI,,2370,2377,,10.1002/elps.201400128,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/elps.201400128,,,8,"Biochemical Research Methods; Chemistry, Analytical",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Biochemistry & Molecular Biology; Chemistry,AN2DU,24823494.0,Green Accepted,,,2024-08-15,WOS:000340394800013,1,,0,766

The Arduino development platform is a good example of a successful hardware project with a great community of developers and users around it. The apparition of personal 3D printers is bringing the open source philosophy to the fabrication of physical things as well. This new technology is in need of new designing tools to take advantage of it. In this paper we are presenting the C++ Object Oriented Mechanics Library (OOML), a tool to design mechanical components, taking into account the needs and requirements of these emerging technologies. These designs can be easily shared, reused, and modified. The OOML brings together the advantages of (1) modelling things through code, (2) the object oriented programming paradigm, and (3) the power of C++. In the OOML, mechanical parts are described as geometrical combinations of basic primitives. Once a part is defined, fabrication files can be generated in order to print, or mechanize it.

The use of DIY technology is already widespread, particularly in countries with limited access to science funding, and is catalyzing the development of open-source technologies. Beyond financial accessibility, open hardware can be transformational for the access of laboratories to equipment by reducing dependence on import logistics and enabling direct knowledge transfer. Central drivers to the adoption of appropriate open-source technologies in biology laboratories around the world are open sharing, digital fabrication, local production, the use of standard parts, and detailed documentation. This Essay examines the global spread of open hardware and discusses which kinds of open-source technologies are the most beneficial in scientific environments with economic and infrastructural constraints.","[Wenzel, Tobias] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Inst Biol & Med Engn, Sch Engn Med & Biol Sci, Macul, Region Metropol, Chile",Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Chile,"Wenzel, T (corresponding author), Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Inst Biol & Med Engn, Sch Engn Med & Biol Sci, Macul, Region Metropol, Chile.",tobias.wenzel@uc.cl,"Wenzel, Tobias/A-2319-2015","Wenzel, Tobias/0000-0001-8443-1315",ANID FONDECYT Iniciacion [11200666]; CZI project Latin American Hub for Bioimaging Through Open Hardware',ANID FONDECYT Iniciacion; CZI project Latin American Hub for Bioimaging Through Open Hardware',"This work is part of funded projects granted to T.W. from ANID FONDECYT Iniciacion 11200666 (https://www.anid.cl/concursos/concurso/?id=278) and the CZI project Latin American Hub for Bioimaging Through Open Hardware' (https://chanzuckerberg.com/imaging/latin-american-hub-for-bioimaging-through-open-hardware/).

A functioning design is necessary but not sufficient for a project to help patients. The device must be taken through regulatory approval by a manufacturer that understands why design decisions were taken.

Findings - As a result of the argument made herein, it is possible to perceive the viability of the OSH model in terms of entrepreneurship and technological innovation in the academic sphere, and to perceive its benefits before social and economic needs in areas such as health and education. Research limitations/implications - There are no empirical or quantifiable data in the literature that enable comparison between OSH and traditional technological innovation models. Originality/value - The considerations on the philosophical value of OSH and its business models are scarcely explored in international literature. As far as we know, relating OSH to technological innovation entrepreneurship in the academic sphere, as well as its singularities in Brazil regarding the innovation national system and social and economic demands, is a unique approach in literature.","[Cota, Vinicius Rosa] Univ Fed Sao Joao Del Rei, Lab Interdisciplinar Neuroengn & Neurociencias, Dept Engn Eletr, Sao Joao Del Rei, Brazil; [Aguiar, Cleiton Lopes] Univ Fed Minas Gerais, Nucleo Neurociencias, Dept Fisiol & Biofis, Inst Ciencias Biol, Belo Horizonte, MG, Brazil; [Neto, Bezamat de Souza] Univ Fed Sao Joao Del Rei, Dept Ciencias Adm & Contabeis, Sao Joao Del Rei, Brazil; [Benegas, Miguel] Univ Nacl Gen Sarmiento, Inst Ind, Los Polvorines, Argentina",Universidade Federal de Sao Joao del-Rei; Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais; Universidade Federal de Sao Joao del-Rei,"Cota, VR (corresponding author), Univ Fed Sao Joao Del Rei, Lab Interdisciplinar Neuroengn & Neurociencias, Dept Engn Eletr, Sao Joao Del Rei, Brazil.",vrcota@ufsj.edu.br,"Cota, Vinícius Rosa/F-1752-2018; Lopes Aguiar, Cleiton/B-3776-2018","Cota, Vinícius Rosa/0000-0002-2338-5949; Lopes Aguiar, Cleiton/0000-0001-9310-6338",,,,,72,3,3,2,21,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",2515-8961,,,INNOV MANAG REV,Innov.

However, a common belief is that the greater economic cost and complexity of hybrid digital objects (i.e., digital objects with both hardware and software) precludes their development with open source methods traditionally used for software. We study a sophisticated OSH named White Rabbit initiated at CERN and developed through a vibrant and heterogenous open source community. Our findings show that the assumption that hardware and software require fundamentally distinctive development and production modes should be replaced with a more nuanced differentiation characterized by three main attributes describing an object's composition: embodiment, modularity, and granularity. Taken together, these three attributes determine how a hybrid object is developed throughout its evolution in an open source community. Our research offers several contributions. First, we provide a more nuanced view of the consequences of the material embodiment of hardware. Once considered a simple deterrent to open source development, we describe how economic cost is subordinate to more influential aspects of an object's physical layers: as the open source community modifies the object to accommodate the operating requirements of diverse physical instantiations, such modifications can be incorporated in the logical design covered by the open source license. Additionally, we show how embodiment, modularity, and granularity progress through the object's evolution and how this maturation subsequently affects development modes. We trace the implications of our findings for hybrids and digital object conceptualizations in IS research, open source development and, more broadly, normative implications for OSH in scientific and commercial computing.","[Priego, Laia Pujol; Wareham, Jonathan] Ramon Llull Univ, ESADE Business Sch, Barcelona, Spain",Universitat Ramon Llull; Escuela Superior de Administracion y Direccion de Empresas (ESADE),"Priego, LP (corresponding author), Ramon Llull Univ, ESADE Business Sch, Barcelona, Spain.",Laia.pujol@esade.edu; Jonathan.wareham@esade.edu,,"Wareham, Jonathan/0000-0002-5816-7140; Pujol Priego, Laia/0000-0001-6796-729X",,,,,97,2,2,37,64,SOC INFORM MANAGE-MIS RES CENT,MINNEAPOLIS,"UNIV MINNESOTA-SCH MANAGEMENT 271 19TH AVE SOUTH, MINNEAPOLIS, MN 55455 USA",0276-7783,,,MIS QUART,MIS Q.,JUN,2023,47,2,,,,,639,667,,10.25300/MISQ/2022/16733,http://dx.doi.org/10.25300/MISQ/2022/16733,,,29,"Computer Science, Information Systems; Information Science & Library Science; Management",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Computer Science; Information Science & Library Science; Business & Economics,T2YS6,,hybrid,,,2024-08-15,WOS:001076697300006,0,conceptual? ,0,779

To facilitate mass collaboration and accelerate progress, many groups have adopted open-source development models, inspired by the long history of open-source development in software. According to the Open-source Hardware Association (OSHWA), Open-source Hardware (OSH) is a term for tangible artifacts - machines, devices, or other physical things - whose design has been released to the public in such a way that anyone can make, modify, and use them. One major obstacle to translating the growing body of work on open-source ventilators into clinical practice is compliance with regulations and conformance with mandated technical standards for effective performance and device safety. This is exacerbated by the inherent complexity of the regulatory process, which is tailored to traditional centralized development models, as well as the rapid changes and alternative pathways that have emerged during the pandemic. As a step in addressing this challenge, this paper provides developers, evaluators, and potential users of emergency ventilators with the first iteration of a pragmatic, open-source assessment framework that incorporates existing regulatory guidelines from Australia, Canada, UK and USA. We also provide an example evaluation for one open-source emergency ventilator design. The evaluation process has been divided into three levels: 1. Adequacy of open-source project documentation; 2. Clinical performance requirements, and 3. Conformance with technical standards.(c) 2022 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Such firm strategies are now common for open source software and other information goods. However, they pose conceptual and practical uncertainties for hardware-focused companies, particularly as research on open hardware has emphasized community rather than firm success. Here we study firm openness in 3D printing, with a case study of how MakerBot Industries leveraged external communities and selective openness become the consumer market leader. After reviewing the literature on systemic innovation and selective openness, we document the proprietary strategies of a dozen startup companies during the first two decades of the 3D printing industry. We contrast this to the open hardware, software and content strategy that MakerBot's founders used to enter and grow the consumer market from 2009 onward. We show how MakerBot shifted to a selectively open, systemic innovation strategy that complemented proprietary hardware and software with open user-generated content from its Thingiverse online community. From this, we suggest the inherent complementarity of selective openness strategies between open and proprietary components, and conclude with predictions as to when and how a startup or incumbent firm will combine open and proprietary elements.

Openness is viewed as one of the key principles of the maker movement. As the global maker movement is a bricolage of diverse and situated practices and traditions, there are also many different interpretations and ways of practicing openness. We have explored this diversity with an integrative literature review, relying on the Web of Science (TM) database. We identified three interrelated but also, in part, mutually contested approaches to openness. Firstly, openness often refers to applying open hardware. Secondly, it is in many cases related to the inclusion and empowerment of various groups in making. Thirdly, openness appears to be seen as a means to pursue economic growth through increasing innovation activity and entrepreneurship. Our results also highlight the substantial barriers encountered by makers while aiming to open up their practices. These barriers include: value conflicts in which openness is overridden by other important values; exclusion of lower income groups from making due to a lack of resources; and difficulties in maintaining long-term activities. The different meanings of openness together with the barriers create tensions within the maker movement while implementing openness. We propose that engaging in a reflexive futures dialogue on the consequences of these tensions can enhance the maker movement to become more open, inclusive and resilient.","[Saari, Hanna; akerman, Maria; Myllyoja, Jouko] VTT Tech Res Ctr Finland, Espoo 02044, Finland; [Kieslinger, Barbara] Ctr Social Innovat, A-1150 Vienna, Austria; [Sipos, Regina] Tech Univ Berlin, Inst Vocat Educ & Work Studies, D-10623 Berlin, Germany",VTT Technical Research Center Finland; Technical University of Berlin,"Saari, H (corresponding author), VTT Tech Res Ctr Finland, Espoo 02044, Finland.",kieslinger@zsi.at; kieslinger@zsi.at; kieslinger@zsi.at; jouko.myllyoja@vtt.fi; sipos@tu-berlin.de,"Sipos, Regina/KXR-3040-2024","Sipos, Regina/0000-0002-8812-2082; Saari, Hanna/0000-0001-5856-3146; Akerman, Maria/0000-0001-6895-3375; Kieslinger, Barbara/0000-0002-0671-1917",,,,,69,4,4,6,19,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2071-1050,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,DEC,2021,13,24,,,,,,,13559,10.3390/su132413559,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su132413559,,,20,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,ZX8GY,,"Green Published, gold",,,2024-08-15,WOS:000772131900001,0,review ,0,782

The review investigates how studies are framed as open design and open-source design (including 'open hardware'): how researchers contribute to conceptual theorizing about open design or study its practical operationalization, in do-it-yourself 'making,' manufacturing and practices in-between these domains. Most of the papers reviewed were empirical studies from diverse fields. Open design was analyzed not only as contributions and solutions, but also as open-to-participate processes, openly shared processes, and open, closed, and modular (open and closed) outcomes. Various research fields presented an open design framing as an alternative to the status quo: new ways to do business and/or to foster socio-environmental sustainability. On the manufacturing side, open design was sought especially to accelerate innovation cycles; on the making side, it was espoused to foster democratization. However, the studies reviewed indicated that companies do not appear to develop much beyond business-as-usual. From the research perspective, the conceptual potential of open design to promote sustainability saw little practical exploration. Additionally, issues around open design community governance and ownership, safety and reliability of open outcomes require further investigation.","[Bakirlioglu, Yekta] Univ Limerick, Sch Design, Design Factors Res Grp, Limerick, Ireland; [Kohtala, Cindy] Aalto Univ, Dept Design, INUSE Users & Innovat Res Grp, Espoo, Finland",University of Limerick; Aalto University,"Bakirlioglu, Y (corresponding author), Univ Limerick, Sch Design, Design Factors Res Grp, Limerick, Ireland.",yekta.bakirlioglu@ul.ie; cindy.kohtala@aalto.fi,"Kohtala, Cindy/T-9191-2019; Bakırlıoğlu, Yekta/AAW-4216-2020","Bakırlıoğlu, Yekta/0000-0001-6949-0683; Kohtala, Cindy/0000-0002-7417-0745",Academy of Finland [289520]; KAUTE Foundation; Academy of Finland(Kulttuurin ja Yhteiskunnan Tutkimuksen Toimikunta) [289520]; KAUTE-Saatio; Academy of Finland (AKA) [289520] Funding Source: Academy of Finland (AKA),Academy of Finland(Research Council of Finland); KAUTE Foundation; Academy of Finland(Kulttuurin ja Yhteiskunnan Tutkimuksen Toimikunta); KAUTE-Saatio; Academy of Finland (AKA)(Research Council of Finland),This study was supported in part by the Academy of Finland (Grant 289520 'Getting collaborative design done') and the KAUTE Foundation.; This work was supported by the Academy of Finland(Kulttuurin ja Yhteiskunnan Tutkimuksen Toimikunta) [Grant 289520 'Getting collaborative design done']; and KAUTE-Saatio.,,127,13,14,2,24,TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,PHILADELPHIA,"530 WALNUT STREET, STE 850, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",0737-0024,1532-7051,,HUM-COMPUT INTERACT,Hum.-Comput.

In these narratives, citizen participation in design and intellectual property management based on open source principles are the promise of more sustainable production models. In this context, openness in product design and development has been the object of growing interest and experimentation from academia, businesses and grassroots communities. As a result, numerous concepts emerged that attempt to grasp the essence of this phenomenon, unfortunately leading to overlapping, conflicting or speculative depictions. In this article, we share the understanding we gained throughout 6 years of research on Open Design and Open Source Hardware and attempt to make the difference between myths and facts. We depict an enthusiastic but realistic picture of Open Design and Open Source Hardware practices as we could observe them and deliver a structured framework to situate concepts and their differences. From this, we share seven observations leading to seven corresponding research questions and establish a research agenda to stimulate further investigations into this socially relevant and potentially ground-breaking phenomenon.","[Bonvoisin, Jeremy] Univ Bath, Dept Mech Engn, Bath, Avon, England; [Mies, Robert] Tech Univ Berlin, Inst Machine Tools & Factory Management, Chair Qual Sci, Berlin, Germany; [Boujut, Jean-Francois] Grenoble Inst Technol, Ind Engn, Grenoble, France",University of Bath; Technical University of Berlin; Communaute Universite Grenoble Alpes; Institut National Polytechnique de Grenoble,"Boujut, JF (corresponding author), Grenoble Inst Technol, Ind Engn, Grenoble, France.",jean-francois.boujut@grenoble-inp.fr,,"Mies, Robert/0000-0003-0195-7405; BOUJUT, Jean-Francois/0000-0003-1331-7800; Bonvoisin, Jeremy/0000-0003-4146-1607","French-German interdisciplinary research project 'Open!

Product customisation emphasises the fulfilment of explicit requirements of a defined market segment, but product individualisation targets at satisfying the particular needs of a customer. Mass Individualisation (MI) is a new product design approach comprising of an open hardware platform and multiple modules to be integrated with the platform. It gives freedom to end-users to integrate different modules into the platform as per their choice. Technological and strategic integration of all actors involved in the design process is the primary focus of this research. This paper identifies key areas which need to be focussed on to realise this approach and convert it into an industrial practice by an explorative study of existing product design and customisation approaches. An industrial survey was conducted, and results for the industrial implication and insights on this approach are presented. The findings show that the end product from product design for MI will be more creative and innovative by the networking of all actors, and offers more individualised and technologically advanced products.","[Sikhwal, Ravi K.; Childs, Peter R.

His aim is neither environmental protection nor the prevention of unforeseen side-effects of technology development, but the comprehensibility of technologies' operating principles for the user. For if the construction or repairing of tools requires expert knowledge inaccessible to the public, this necessarily entails social imbalances in power. In a similar manner, Bernard Stiegler conceives the delegation of know-how to technological systems as a kind of proletarianization that ultimately may result in a loss of savoir-vivre. Without sweepingly rejecting the division of labour, automation or specialized knowledge, practices of commoning respond to such diagnoses: free software like GNU/Linux or open hardware largely succeed in unlinking the expert knowledge that advanced computing doubtlessly requires from problematic power effects. From this perspective, proprietary algorithms are problematic, as their lack of transparency prevents conviviality. This also holds for the practices of data aggregation and extraction which steadily increase the information gap between platform providers and users. An even more fundamental problem is posed by so-called ""self-learning"", i.e., recursively adapting, algorithms: it is not clear how and to what extent the knowledge and instructions generated by ""artificial intelligence"" can be traced and reconstructed by human insight. Thus, we are confronted with a situation of potentially non-recoverable proletarianization and non-conviviality that exposes a renewed urgency of Illich's considerations concerning technological self-limitation.","[Beinsteiner, Andreas] Univ Wien, Vienna, Austria",University of Vienna,"Beinsteiner, A (corresponding author), Univ Wien, Vienna, Austria.",andreas.beinsteiner@univie.ac.at,,,,,,,17,3,3,1,4,DE GRUYTER POLAND SP Z O O,WARSAW,"BOGUMILA ZUGA 32A STR, 01-811 WARSAW, MAZOVIA, POLAND",2451-3474,,,OPEN CULT STUD,Open Cult.

One of these barriers is concerning the accessibility and affordability of assistive technologies (ATs) that help to enhance the quality of life of these persons. In this context, this systematic literature review (SLR) analyzes and describes how free and open-source hardware (OSHW) and open software (OSS) are employed in the design, development, and deployment of low-cost ATs. In the SLR process, different ATs were analyzed for disabilities such as visual, mobility, upper body, prostheses, hearing & speaking, daily living, and participation in society. The ATs were designed with diverse OSHW and OSS technologies such as Arduino, Raspberry Pi, NVidia Jeston, OpenCV, YOLO, MobileNet, EEG and EMG signal conditioning devices, actuators, and sensors such as ultrasonic, LiDar, or flex. 809 studies were collected and analyzed from the database Web of Science, GitHub, and the specialized journals in OSHW HardwareX and the Journal of Open Hardware during the years 2013-2022. In the first part of the SLR, the bibliometric trends and topic clusters regarding the selected studies are described. Secondly, the ATs identified with open source technologies, e.g., sensor-based or computer vision-based, are described along with a complete state-of-art about these based on each disability recognized. Finally, the issues and challenges to this approach are explored including technical factors, documentation, government policies, and the inclusion of disabled people in open source co-creation. The purpose of this study is to inform practitioners, designers, or stakeholders about low-cost (frugal) ATs with OSHW and OSS, and thus promote their development, accessibility, and affordability, contributing to benefit the community of disabled people.","[Ariza, Jonathan Alvarez] Corp Univ Minuto Dios UNIMINUTO, Engn Fac, Dept Technol Elect, Bogota 111021, Colombia; [Pearce, Joshua M.

These include expansions from software into general culture through 'Free Culture' movements and, more recently, expansions from software into hardware and design. This article provides a critical perspective on the democratic potential of these broader 'open' contribution structures by examining how open source contributions to both software and hardware increase the opportunities for democratic participation in production, governance and knowledge exchange. By analysing attempts to 'open source' the sharing of hardware designs, it also notes the limitations of this democratization. The insights developed in the article nuance the relationship between open source cultures and commercial and market structures, identifying how the generative opportunities created by certain aspects of open source contribution structures increase the potential for democratizing production of communication tools, but also how incongruities across different open-source cultures and communities of practice limit the democratic potential of these processes.","LSE, London WC2A 2AE, England",University of London; London School Economics & Political Science,"Powell, A (corresponding author), LSE, Houghton St, London WC2A 2AE, England.",a.powell@lse.ac.uk,,,,,,,50,77,87,0,29,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0163-4437,1460-3675,,MEDIA CULT SOC,Media Cult.

Among all pollutants, fine particulate matters (PM2.5) directly related to various serious health concerns, e.g., lung cancer, premature death, asthma, and cardiovascular and respiratory diseases. To enhance the quality of urban living, sensors are deployed to create smart cities. In this paper, we present a participatory urban sensing framework for PM2.5 monitoring with more than 2500 devices deployed in Taiwan and 29 other countries. It is one of the largest deployment project for PM2.5 monitor in the world as we know until May 2017. The key feature of the framework is its open system architecture, which is based on the principles of open hardware, open source software, and open data. To facilitate the deployment of the framework, we investigate the accuracy issue of low-cost particle sensors with a comprehensive set of comparison evaluations to identify the most reliable sensor. By working closely with government authorities, industry partners, and maker communities, we can construct an effective eco-system for participatory urban sensing of PM2.5 particles. Based on our deployment achievements to date, we provide a number of data services to improve environmental awareness, trigger on-demand responses, and assist future government policymaking. The proposed framework is highly scalable and sustainable with the potential to facilitate the Internet of Things, smart cities, and citizen science in the future.","[Chen, Ling-Jyh; Lee, Hu-Cheng; Liu, Hao-Min; Hsieh, Hsin-Hung; Huang, Yu-Te] Acad Sinica, Inst Informat Sci, Taipei, Taiwan; [Ho, Yao-Hua; Wu, Hsuan-Cho] Natl Taiwan Normal Univ, Dept Comp Sci & Informat Engn, Taipei, Taiwan; [Lung, Shih-Chun Candice] Acad Sinica, Res Ctr Environm Changes, Taipei, Taiwan",Academia Sinica - Taiwan; National Taiwan Normal University; Academia Sinica - Taiwan,"Chen, LJ (corresponding author), Acad Sinica, Inst Informat Sci, Taipei, Taiwan.",cclljj@iis.sinica.edu.tw,"Lung, Shih-Chun Candice/ABA-1011-2020; Lung, Shih-Chun Candice/GYD-5623-2022; Ho, Yao-Hua/AIA-3819-2022; Chen, Ling-Jyh/A-6311-2009","Lung, Shih-Chun Candice/0000-0002-4227-0469; Lung, Shih-Chun Candice/0000-0002-4227-0469; Ho, Yao-Hua/0000-0002-7993-525X; Chen, Ling-Jyh/0000-0001-5667-7764","Academia Sinica [MOST 105-2221-E-001-016-MY3, MOST 105-3011-F-001-002, MOST 106-3114-E-001-004, AS-104-SS-A02]; Ministry of Science and Technology of Taiwan","Academia Sinica(Academia Sinica - Taiwan); Ministry of Science and Technology of Taiwan(Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan)","This work was supported in part by the Ministry of Science and Technology of Taiwan and in part by Academia Sinica under Grant MOST 105-2221-E-001-016-MY3, Grant MOST 105-3011-F-001-002, Grant MOST 106-3114-E-001-004, and Grant AS-104-SS-A02.",,31,125,132,1,51,IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC,PISCATAWAY,"445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA",2169-3536,,,IEEE ACCESS,IEEE Access,,2017,5,,,,,,14441,14454,,10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2723919,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2723919,,,14,"Computer Science, Information Systems; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Telecommunications",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Computer Science; Engineering; Telecommunications,FI2GW,,gold,,,2024-08-15,WOS:000411757800063,0,not sure ,0,795

For that reason, many countries invest in networks of reference monitoring stations that measure air quality in real time. However, the high installation and maintenance costs of these stations mean that smaller cities or underdeveloped regions are less covered by such stations. In these regions, alternative detection technologies such as low-cost monitoring systems can be used instead. Unfortunately, the results of such monitoring devices are often questioned by academics. This contribution proposes the design of an air quality monitoring system where cost and reliability have been optimized from a hardware point of view. In addition, the device has been coupled to an IoT platform so that inexperienced users can view and share the collected information The design of affordable systems increases the ability to perform ad hoc analysis at the level of neighborhoods or cities by citizen science organizations or governmental entities.","[Martinez, Alain; Hernandez-Rodriguez, Erik; Hernandez, Luis] Univ Cent Marta Abreu Villas, Fac Elect Engn, Dept Automat Control, Santa Clara 54830, Cuba; [Schalm, Olivier] Antwerp Maritime Acad, B-2030 Antwerp, Belgium; [Gonzalez-Rivero, Rosa Amalia; Alejo-Sanchez, Daniellys] Univ Cent Marta Abreu Villas, Fac Chem & Pharm, Dept Chem, Santa Clara 54830, Cuba","Universidad Central ""Marta Abreu"" de Las Villas; Universidad Central ""Marta Abreu"" de Las Villas","Martinez, A (corresponding author), Univ Cent Marta Abreu Villas, Fac Elect Engn, Dept Automat Control, Santa Clara 54830, Cuba.",amguardia@uclv.edu.cu; ehrodriguez@uclv.cu; luishs@uclv.edu.cu; olivier.schalm@hzs.be; rogrivero@uclv.cu; daniellysas@uclv.edu.cu,"Martinez, Alain/JFL-0999-2023; González Rivero, Rosa Amalia/HOC-5383-2023; Schalm, Olivier/AAV-5757-2021","Martinez, Alain/0000-0002-6873-126X; González Rivero, Rosa Amalia/0000-0002-6905-4379; Schalm, Olivier/0000-0001-8705-7293",VLIR-UOS Project AIR@PORT: Low-Cost Decision Support System to Evaluate the Impact of Ships on the Air Quality in the Port City Cienfuegos [SI-2019-01-20],VLIR-UOS Project AIR@PORT: Low-Cost Decision Support System to Evaluate the Impact of Ships on the Air Quality in the Port City Cienfuegos,This work was supported in part by the VLIR-UOS Project AIR@PORT: Low-Cost Decision Support System to Evaluate the Impact of Ships on the Air Quality in the Port City Cienfuegos (SI-2019-01-20).,,13,6,8,5,8,IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC,PISCATAWAY,"445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA",1943-0663,1943-0671,,IEEE EMBED SYST LETT,IEEE Embed.

A cornerstone for Open Design is to broaden participation in technology innovation by allowing people to use and contribute to publicly shared resources. Makerspaces are important access points to share and contribute to these resources. However, prior to entering the physical door of a makerspace, makerspaces' social media presence serve as the 'front door' for Open Design activities. In this paper, we examine different 'front doors' of Open Design, asking: What are the characteristics that produce makerspaces' social media presences, and how do these representations shape potential access to Open Design activities? We manually collected and qualitatively analyzed 500 public posts on the Facebook sites of five makerspaces in Copenhagen, Denmark. By choosing the same geographical area, we were able to explore the characteristics of makerspaces' social media presences for the same potential population of Open Design participants. Our analysis identifies three main characteristics of makerspaces' social media presence, which together shape access to Open Design activities, namely reach, transparency, and discourse. The display of these characteristics produce openness and availability in unique ways, and is constitutive for how Open Design activities are produced online. In this paper, we do not argue for or against specific social media representations. Instead, we argue that the specificities and differences between makerspaces' social media presences in the same geographical region have the strength of producing different identities across spaces, allowing for a broader definition and potential participation in Open Design.","[Menendez-Blanco, Maria; Bjorn, Pernille] Univ Copenhagen, DIKU, Comp Sci Dept, Human Ctr Comp Sect HCC, Copenhagen, Denmark; [Bjorn, Pernille] Univ Washington, Dept Human Ctr Design & Engn HCDE, Seattle, WA 98195 USA",University of Copenhagen; University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle,"Menendez-Blanco, M (corresponding author), Univ Copenhagen, DIKU, Comp Sci Dept, Human Ctr Comp Sect HCC, Copenhagen, Denmark.",maria.mb@di.ku.dk; pernille.bjorn@di.ku.dk,"Blanco, Maria Menendez/AAY-3819-2020","Blanco, Maria Menendez/0000-0002-7353-5183",Department of Computer Science (DIKU) of the University of Copenhagen; Fulbright association,Department of Computer Science (DIKU) of the University of Copenhagen; Fulbright association,"Thanks to the Department of Computer Science (DIKU) of the University of Copenhagen for funding important activities reported in this paper, as well as to the Fulbright association for funding the research project: Makerspace Methodologies: Diversity in Computer Science through Craft, Design & Technology.",,48,4,5,0,19,TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,PHILADELPHIA,"530 WALNUT STREET, STE 850, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",0737-0024,1532-7051,,HUM-COMPUT INTERACT,Hum.-Comput.

Rapid growth in the Internet-Of-Things (IoT) and the maker movement is paving the way for low-cost electronic sensors to transform global environmental monitoring. Accessible and inexpensive sensor construction is also fostering exciting opportunities for citizen science and participatory research. Drawing on 6 years of developmental work with Arduino-based open-source hardware and software, extensive laboratory and field testing, and incorporation of such technology into active research programmes, we outline a series of successes, failures and lessons learned in designing and deploying environmental sensors. Six case studies are presented: a water table depth probe, air and water quality sensors, multi-parameter weather stations, a time-sequencing lake sediment trap, and a sonic anemometer for monitoring sand transport. Schematics, code and purchasing guidance to reproduce our sensors are described in the paper, with detailed build instructions hosted on our King's College London Geography Environmental Sensors Github repository and the FreeStation project website. We show in each case study that manual design and construction can produce research-grade scientific instrumentation (mean bias error for calibrated sensors -0.04 to 23%) for a fraction of the conventional cost, provided rigorous, sensor-specific calibration and field testing is conducted. In sharing our collective experiences with build-it-yourself environmental monitoring, we intend for this paper to act as a catalyst for physical geographers and the wider environmental science community to begin incorporating low-cost sensor development into their research activities. The capacity to deploy denser sensor networks should ultimately lead to superior environmental monitoring at the local to global scales.","[Chan, Kristofer; Schillereff, Daniel N.; Baas, Andreas C.

Initially designed to appeal to electronic hobbyists, open electronics have formed a global ""maker"" community and are increasingly used in science and industry. In this perspective article, we review the current costs and benefits of open electronics for use in scientific research ranging from the experimental to the theoretical sciences. We discuss how user-made electronic applications can help (I) individual researchers, by increasing the customization, efficiency, and scalability of experiments, while improving data quantity and quality; (II) scientific institutions, by improving access to customizable high-end technologies, sustainability, visibility, and interdisciplinary collaboration potential; and (III) the scientific community, by improving transparency and reproducibility, helping decouple research capacity from funding, increasing innovation, and improving collaboration potential among researchers and the public. We further discuss how current barriers like poor awareness, knowledge access, and time investments can be resolved by increased documentation and collaboration, and provide guidelines for academics to enter this emerging field. We highlight that open electronics are a promising and powerful tool to help scientific research to become more innovative and reproducible and offer a key practical solution to improve democratic access to science.","[Oellermann, Michael] Tech Univ Munich, TUM Sch Life Sci, Aquat Syst Biol Unit, Muhlenweg 22, D-85354 Freising Weihenstephan, Germany; [Oellermann, Michael] Univ Tasmania, Fisheries & Aquaculture Ctr, Inst Marine & Antarctic Studies, Private Bag 49, Hobart, Tas 7001, Australia; [Jolles, Jolle W.] Ctr Res Ecol & Forestry Applicat CREAF, Campus UAB,Edifici C, Barcelona 08193, Spain; [Ortiz, Diego] Inst Nacl Tecnol Agr INTA, Estn Expt Manfredi, Ruta 9,Km 636, RA-5988 Cordoba, Argentina; [Seabra, Rui] Univ Porto, Ctr Invest Biodiversidade & Recursos Genet, CIBIO, InBIO Lab Associado, Campus Vairao, P-4485661 Vairao, Portugal; [Seabra, Rui] CIBIO, BIOPOLIS Program Genom Biodivers & Land Planning, Campus Vairao, P-4485661 Vairao, Portugal; [Wenzel, Tobias] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Sch Engn, Inst Biol & Med Engn, Vicuna Mackenna 4860,G92Q 26, Santiago 7820244, Chile; [Wenzel, Tobias] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Sch Med & Biol Sci, Inst Biol & Med Engn, Vicuna Mackenna 4860,G92Q 26, Santiago 7820244, Chile; [Wilson, Hannah] Utah State Univ, Coll Sci, Biol Dept, 5305 Old Main Hill, Logan, UT 84321 USA; [Tanner, Richelle L.] Chapman Univ, Environm Sci & Policy Program, 1 Univ Dr, Orange, CA 92866 USA",Technical University of Munich; University of Tasmania; Centro de Investigacion Ecologica y Aplicaciones Forestales (CREAF-CERCA); Autonomous University of Barcelona; Instituto Nacional de Tecnologia Agropecuaria (INTA); Universidade do Porto; Universidade do Porto; Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Chile; Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Chile; Utah System of Higher Education; Utah State University; Chapman University System; Chapman University,"Oellermann, M (corresponding author), Tech Univ Munich, TUM Sch Life Sci, Aquat Syst Biol Unit, Muhlenweg 22, D-85354 Freising Weihenstephan, Germany.; Oellermann, M (corresponding author), Univ Tasmania, Fisheries & Aquaculture Ctr, Inst Marine & Antarctic Studies, Private Bag 49, Hobart, Tas 7001, Australia.",michael.oellermann@utas.edu.au,"Wenzel, Tobias/AAN-2827-2020; Wenzel, Tobias/A-2319-2015; Jolles, Jolle Wolter/E-9842-2011; Seabra, Rui/J-7814-2012; Oellermann, Michael/G-7073-2011","Wenzel, Tobias/0000-0001-8443-1315; Jolles, Jolle Wolter/0000-0001-9905-2633; Seabra, Rui/0000-0002-0240-3992; Oellermann, Michael/0000-0001-5392-6737; Ortiz, Diego/0000-0001-8584-8921","German Research Foundation fellowship [OE 658/2]; California Sea Grant Delta Science Postdoctoral Fellowship [SWC 20-42, R/SF-107]; EMBL; Fellowship Freies Wissen by Wikimedia DE and co; ANID/FONDECYT/INICIACION [11200666]; FEDER through POR Norte [NORTE01-0145-FEDER-031053]; FCT [PTDC/BIA-BMA/31053/2017, CEECIND/01424/2017]; INTA [2019-PE-E6-I128-001, 2019-PE-E6I114-001, REC I117]",German Research Foundation fellowship(German Research Foundation (DFG)); California Sea Grant Delta Science Postdoctoral Fellowship; EMBL; Fellowship Freies Wissen by Wikimedia DE and co; ANID/FONDECYT/INICIACION; FEDER through POR Norte; FCT(Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia (FCT)); INTA,"M.O. was supported by a German Research Foundation fellowship OE 658/2.

Uncrewed aerial vehicles (UAVs, or drones) can be a powerful tool for research in disciplines such as agriculture and environmental sciences, but their use in research is currently dominated by proprietary, closed source tools. The objective of this work was to collect, curate, organize and test a set of open source tools for aerial data capture for research purposes. The Open Science Drone Toolkit was built through a collaborative and iterative process by more than 100 people in five countries, and comprises an open-hardware autonomous drone and off-the-shelf hardware, open-source software, and guides and protocols that enable the user to perform all the necessary tasks to obtain aerial data. Data obtained with this toolkit over a wheat field was compared to data from satellite imagery and a commercial hand-held sensor, finding a high correlation for both instruments. Our results demonstrate the possibility of capturing research-grade aerial data using affordable, accessible, and customizable open source software and hardware, and using open workflows.","[Irujo, Gustavo Pereyra] Consejo Nacl Invest Cient & Tecn, Inst Nacl Tecnol Agr, Balcarce, Argentina; [Velazquez, Luciano] Univ Nacl Mar del Plata, Fac Ciencias Agr, Balcarce, Argentina; [Favero, Celeste Molina] Univ Nacl Mar del Plata, Unidad Integrada Balcarce, Inst Nacl Tecnol Agr, Balcarce, Argentina",Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Cientificas y Tecnicas (CONICET); Instituto Nacional de Tecnologia Agropecuaria (INTA); National University of Mar del Plata; National University of Mar del Plata; Instituto Nacional de Tecnologia Agropecuaria (INTA),"Irujo, GP (corresponding author), Consejo Nacl Invest Cient & Tecn, Inst Nacl Tecnol Agr, Balcarce, Argentina.",pereyrairujo.gustavo@conicet.gov.ar,"; Molina-Favero, Celeste/I-5442-2013","Pereyra Irujo, Gustavo/0000-0002-2261-6928; Molina-Favero, Celeste/0000-0002-7990-1076","Mozilla Foundation (Mozilla Science Mini Grant); Knowledge/Culture/Ecologies (KCE2017, Western Sydney University); Shuttleworth Foundation (Flash Grant); Instituto Nacional de Tecnologia Agropecuaria [2019-PD-E3-I060]; Programa Cooperativo para el Desarrollo Tecnologico Agroalimentario y Agroindustrial del Cono Sur (PROCISUR);  [PNCYO-1124072]","Mozilla Foundation (Mozilla Science Mini Grant); Knowledge/Culture/Ecologies (KCE2017, Western Sydney University); Shuttleworth Foundation (Flash Grant); Instituto Nacional de Tecnologia Agropecuaria; Programa Cooperativo para el Desarrollo Tecnologico Agroalimentario y Agroindustrial del Cono Sur (PROCISUR);","Funding for this project was provided by Mozilla Foundation (Mozilla Science Mini Grant, foundation.mozilla.org) to GPI and PB, Knowledge/Culture/Ecologies (KCE2017, Western Sydney University, westernsydney.edu.au) to PB, Shuttleworth Foundation (Flash Grant, shuttleworthfoundation.org) to PB, Programa Cooperativo para el Desarrollo Tecnologico Agroalimentario y Agroindustrial del Cono Sur (PROCISUR, www.procisur.org.uy) to GPI, Instituto Nacional de Tecnologia Agropecuaria (PNCYO-1124072 and 2019-PD-E3-I060, inta.gob. ar) to GPI.

To prepare for the next pandemic, this study reviews the state-of-the-art of open hardware designs needed in a COVID-19-like pandemic. It evaluates the readiness of the top twenty technologies requested by the Government of India. The results show that the majority of the actual medical products have some open source development, however, only 15% of the supporting technologies required to produce them are freely available. The results show there is still considerable research needed to provide open source paths for the development of all the medical hardware needed during pandemics. Five core areas of future research are discussed, which include (i) technical development of a wide-range of open source solutions for all medical supplies and devices, (ii) policies that protect the productivity of laboratories, makerspaces, and fabrication facilities during a pandemic, as well as (iii) streamlining the regulatory process, (iv) developing Good-Samaritan laws to protect makers and designers of open medical hardware, as well as to compel those with knowledge that will save lives to share it, and (v) requiring all citizen-funded research to be released with free and open source licenses.","[Pearce, Joshua M.] Michigan Technol Univ, Dept Mat Sci & Engn, Houghton, MI 49931 USA; [Pearce, Joshua M.] Michigan Technol Univ, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, Houghton, MI 49931 USA; [Pearce, Joshua M.] Univ Lorraine, Equipe Rech Proc Innovatifs ERPI, F-54000 Nancy, France; [Pearce, Joshua M.] Aalto Univ, Sch Elect Engn, Espoo 02150, Finland",Michigan Technological University; Michigan Technological University; Universite de Lorraine; Aalto University,"Pearce, JM (corresponding author), Michigan Technol Univ, Dept Mat Sci & Engn, Houghton, MI 49931 USA.; Pearce, JM (corresponding author), Michigan Technol Univ, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, Houghton, MI 49931 USA.; Pearce, JM (corresponding author), Univ Lorraine, Equipe Rech Proc Innovatifs ERPI, F-54000 Nancy, France.; Pearce, JM (corresponding author), Aalto Univ, Sch Elect Engn, Espoo 02150, Finland.",pearce@mtu.edu,"Pearce, Joshua/C-9240-2013","Pearce, Joshua/0000-0001-9802-3056",Witte Endowment,Witte Endowment,This research was funded by the Witte Endowment.,,229,36,37,0,8,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2504-4494,,J MANUF MATER PROC,J.

This study reviewed the trends of open-source technology, its forms, and some industrial applications. As a case study using open-source hardware and software for the mining industry, this study proposed a low-cost environmental monitoring system for non-metallic underground mines to support mine safety and occupational health issues. The system was developed using open-source hardware, Arduino and 3D printer, to design the monitoring device. An open-source software, MIT App Inventor, was used for developing an Android application for smartphones to enable remote communication with the system. Field experiments were conducted at an underground tunnel and a non-metallic underground mining site to assess the performance of the system in both mobile and static modes, respectively. Although a few limitations related to the precision of the low-cost dust and gas sensors still exist, the findings of the experiments show that the mining industry can benefit from open-source technology deployment when considering cost factors.","[Mardonova, Mokhinabonu; Choi, Yosoon] Pukyong Natl Univ, Dept Energy Resources Engn, Busan 48513, South Korea",Pukyong National University,"Choi, Y (corresponding author), Pukyong Natl Univ, Dept Energy Resources Engn, Busan 48513, South Korea.",energy@pknu.ac.kr,"Mardonova, Mokhinabonu/HNC-1152-2023","Mardonova, Mokhinabonu/0000-0001-6466-2909; Choi, Yosoon/0000-0001-9616-3725",Basic Science Research Program through the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) - Ministry of Education [2018R1D1A1A09083947],Basic Science Research Program through the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) - Ministry of Education,This work was supported by Basic Science Research Program through the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) funded by the Ministry of Education (2018R1D1A1A09083947).,,84,11,11,2,13,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",2524-3462,2524-3470,,MINING METALL EXPLOR,Mining Metall.
