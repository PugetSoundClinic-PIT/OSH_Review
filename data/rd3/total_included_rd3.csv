The rapid pace of progress in robotics is in part fueled by open source projects, providing researchers with resources, tools, and devices to implement novel ideas and approaches quickly. Open source hardware, in particular, lowers the barrier of entry to new technologies and can further accelerate innovation in robotics. But open hardware is also more difficult to propagate in comparison to open software because it involves replicating physical components, which requires users to have sufficient familiarity and access to fabrication equipment. In this work, we present a review on open robot hardware (ORH) by first highlighting the key benefits and challenges encountered by users and developers of ORH, and then relaying some best practices that can be adopted in developing successful ORH. To accomplish this, we surveyed more than 80 major ORH projects and initiatives across different domains within robotics. Finally, we identify strategies exemplified by the surveyed projects to further detail the development process, and guide developers through the design, documentation, and dissemination stages of an ORH project.","[Patel, Vatsal V.; Dollar, Aaron M.] Yale Univ, Dept Mech Engn & Mat Sci, New Haven, CT 06520 USA; [Liarokapis, Minas V.] Univ Auckland, Dept Mech & Mechatron Engn, New Dexter Res Grp, Auckland 1010, New Zealand",Yale University; University of Auckland,"Patel, VV (corresponding author), Yale Univ, Dept Mech Engn & Mat Sci, New Haven, CT 06520 USA.",v.patel@yale.edu; minas.liarokapis@auckland.ac.nz; aaron.dollar@yale.edu,"Liarokapis, Minas/E-1990-2015","Liarokapis, Minas/0000-0002-6016-1477; Patel, Vatsal/0000-0002-6564-5622","U.S. National Science Foundation [1734190, 1928448]; Directorate For Engineering; Div Of Civil, Mechanical, & Manufact Inn [1928448] Funding Source: National Science Foundation; Div Of Information & Intelligent Systems; Direct For Computer & Info Scie & Enginr [1734190] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","U.S. National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Directorate For Engineering; Div Of Civil, Mechanical, & Manufact Inn(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Engineering (ENG)); Div Of Information & Intelligent Systems; Direct For Computer & Info Scie & Enginr(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Computer & Information Science & Engineering (CISE))",This work was supported by the U.S. National Science Foundation under grants 1734190 and 1928448.,,157,3,3,2,5,IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC,PISCATAWAY,"445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA",1070-9932,1558-223X,,IEEE ROBOT AUTOM MAG,IEEE Robot.

This trend has increased attention to open source hardware (OSH): a phenomenon that extends the intellectual property management and development practices in open source software (OSS) into the design of physical objects. OSH projects are different from OSS projects due to product type, and distinct from traditional closed source new product development (NPD) ones due to their openness. These differences challenge the degree of applicability of existing project success definitions in the OSH context. To investigate project success in OSH, we conducted a qualitative survey with practitioners. We report characteristics of successful OSH projects through three identified themes: (a) value creation - the big-picture impact, (b) quality of output - the quality of the hardware and accompanying documentation and (c) project process - activities that contribute to success. We contextualise by comparing OSH with selected literature on the success of OSS and NPD project management. While our study confirms a similarity between OSS and OSH in defining project success, it also highlights themes that are uniquely important to the latter. These findings are helpful for OSH development practice and could provide lessons for OSS development and closed source NPD.","[Antoniou, Rafaella; Bonvoisin, Jeremy; Hsing, Pen-Yuan; Dekoninck, Elies] Univ Bath, Dept Mech Engn, Bath, Avon, England; [Defazio, Daniela] Univ Bath, Sch Management, Bath, Avon, England",University of Bath; University of Bath,"Antoniou, R (corresponding author), Univ Bath, Dept Mech Engn, Bath, Avon, England.",r.antoniou@bath.ac.uk,"Hsing, Pen-Yuan/JGM-4181-2023; Defazio, Daniela/A-5363-2009","Hsing, Pen-Yuan/0000-0002-5394-879X; Antoniou, Rafaella/0000-0002-3027-0381; Bonvoisin, Jeremy/0000-0003-4146-1607; Defazio, Daniela/0000-0002-8185-4045",European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme [869984]; A.G.

One of the most fundamental questions relating to these phenomena is why developers contribute their private resources to these public goods. While this question has been discussed, theorized, and empirically investigated in the context of OSS, there has been no research so far in the context of OSH. Can we really assume the motivations behind the development of the OSH to be the same as those behind OSS? Based on the self-determination theory (SDT), we provide original insights into the motivations behind contributions to OSH development. We collected data from the most common and active 3D printing communities, which are the main loci of OSH development. We thus have a unique cross-sectional data set with participants from over 30 different countries using all kinds of different OSH platforms. Our analysis reveals several important findings: firstly, the motivations are in some aspects very similar to those in open source software notwithstanding different possibilities, hurdles, and incentives regarding the OSS and OSH. Above all, enjoyment-based intrinsic motivation is a major factor affecting contribution levels. Secondly, among internalized extrinsic motivations, expected private benefits through improving own skills stands out. Thirdly, different factors of internalized extrinsic motivations can have different moderating effects on the effect of enjoyment-based intrinsic motivation. Given the imminent changes in business models throughout manufacturing industries in order to adapt to the challenge that OSH will increasingly pose, our findings have important implications not only for OSH communities and 3D development platforms, but also for businesses that want and probably soon have to engage in open innovation.","[Hausberg, J.

Several researchers worked on how to characterize OSH. Bonvoisin and Mies (Procedia CIRP 78:388-393, 2018) defined the ""open-o-meter"", i.e. a series of criteria to measure the openness of an OSH project. These criteria fall into two categories: product openness and process openness. The open-o-meter gives clear guidelines on measuring product openness by verifying access to specific types of documents, however the criteria to measure process openness are relatively implicit. In this paper, we propose to measure an OSH project's process openness by identifying different types of collaboration tools in that project. We will evaluate 226 OSH projects' process openness by analysing their usage of collaboration tools, for example social media, wiki, GitHub etc. This empirical study showed that the usage of collaboration tools in OSH projects decreases as the score of open-o-meter decreases, which implies that the open-o-meter measures correctly an OSH project's process openness. This research not only validates open-o-meter, but also offers an explicit way to measure an OSH project's process openness that might be very useful for companies to evaluate potential collaborations.","[Dai, X.; Boujut, J.

While some expect such open-source hardware (OSH) to lead to transformational changes in the ways technologies are produced, the available empirical evidence suggests that, to date, the diffusion of most OSH applications has been modest. In this paper, we focus on the limited uptake of OSH and study factors that help explain its adoption by users who replicate available open-source designs. Given our limited understanding of this topic, we present an in-depth study of small wind turbines based on open designs. Through a systematic review of the case-specific literature, we identify and analyse 60 documents, including case studies, construction manuals, market analyses, and technical assessments. We find that the adoption of available open-source wind turbine designs by technology users depends on a number of factors that are currently underemphasized in discussions on the potential of OSH. This includes the quality of OSH self-manufactured products, the particular motivations of adopters to engage with OSH, the availability of adequate production inputs for local manufacturing, and the resources available through open-source communities.","[Reinauer, Tobias; Hansen, Ulrich Elmer] Tech Univ Denmark, Dept Technol Management & Econ, UNEP DTU Partnership, Lyngby, Denmark",Technical University of Denmark,"Reinauer, T (corresponding author), Marmorvej 51, DK-2100 Copenhagen, Denmark.",tobre@dtu.dk,,"Reinauer, Tobias/0000-0002-0803-0250; Hansen, Ulrich Elmer/0000-0002-8997-6717",European Union [713683],European Union(European Union (EU)),This project has received funding from the European Union's Horizon 2020 Research and Innovation Programme under Marie SkodowskaCurie grant agreement No. 713683.,,125,7,7,6,25,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0166-4972,1879-2383,,TECHNOVATION,Technovation,AUG,2021,106,,,,,,,,102289,10.1016/j.technovation.2021.102289,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.technovation.2021.102289,,21-May,12,"Engineering, Industrial; Management; Operations Research & Management Science",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Engineering; Business & Economics; Operations Research & Management Science,TK4HG,,,,,8/15/24,WOS:000674120800002,,1,5,,1,

As predictions showed that the number of patients would exceed current supply of hospital-grade ventilators, a number of formal (academia, the industry and governments) and informal (fablabs and startups) entities raced to develop cheap, easy-to-fabricate mechanical ventilators. The presence of actors with very diverse modus operandi as well as the speed at which the field has grown, led to a fragmented design space characterized by a lack of clear design patterns, projects not meeting the minimum functional requirements or showing little-to-no innovation; but also valid alternatives to hospital-grade devices. In this paper we provide a taxonomic system to help researchers with no background in biomedical engineering to read, understand and contribute to the OSH-MV field. The taxonomy is composed of ten properties that are read through the lenses of three reflection criteria: buildability, adoptability and scalability. We applied the taxonomy to the analysis of seventeen OSH-MV projects, which are representative of the current landscape of possibilities available for COVID-19 patients. We discuss the different design choices adopted by each project highlighting strengths and weaknesses and we suggest possible directions for the development of the OSH-MV field.

Codification and personalization also proved to be important KM approaches, both requiring support in the OSH design process. Using a dendrogram, we highlighted the benefits and challenges of codification together with some interesting concept associations.

In this paper, we study an Open-Source Hardware (OSH) community that aims to improve diagnosis in hospitals and medically underserved areas worldwide. They are designing an echo-stethoscope - a portable ultrasound scanner - that would be affordable in low and middle-income countries. The variety of expertise pooled to achieve this objective puts this knowledge common (KC) at the crossroads of open-source software (OSS), OSH, and medical communities. Unlike typical KC outcomes, an ultrasound probe is a physical object. Development and innovation in the physical world bring social dilemmas that the community has to overcome, restrictions in terms of openness, and in this case, unintended privatization. Our study uses the governing knowledge common framework (GKCF), a modified institutional analysis and development framework, to untangle the interactions between resources, participants, and governance structures. Our research describes why and how the creation of a physical object subject to industry regulation influences the evolution and governance of the KC. We provide evidence that temporary privatization of the KC can be used as a way to protect and sustain a common during the industrialization phase. We also demonstrate how a portfolio of projects is an effective and resilient way to help the common survive this privatization step.","[Carpentier, Pascal] Erasmus Univ, Rotterdam Sch Management, Rotterdam, Netherlands; [Carpentier, Pascal] Drugs Neglected Dis Initiat, Geneva, Switzerland",Erasmus University Rotterdam - Excl Erasmus MC; Erasmus University Rotterdam,"Carpentier, P (corresponding author), Erasmus Univ, Rotterdam Sch Management, Rotterdam, Netherlands.; Carpentier, P (corresponding author), Drugs Neglected Dis Initiat, Geneva, Switzerland.",pcarpentier@dndi.org,,"Carpentier, Pascal/0000-0002-1483-0377",Drugs for Neglected Diseases initiative (DNDi),Drugs for Neglected Diseases initiative (DNDi),"The Drugs for Neglected Diseases initiative (DNDi) is grateful to its donors, public and private, who have provided funding to DNDi since its inception in 2003.

In doing so, it has started to change not only how physical products are designed and developed, but also the commercialisation process. In recent years, authors have witnessed entrepreneurs intentionally choosing not to patent their product design and technologies but instead licencing the designs and technologies under open-source licences. The entrepreneurs share their product designs online with their community - people who congregated due to the shared interests in products' technology or project's social objectives. Founding a startup firm without excluding others from using their own invention is not a common practice. Therefore, there is reason to ask if this choice a strategic decision or irrational action due to short-sightedness or extreme altruism? Conducting interviews with 65 founders, we grounded a framework explaining that the driver of going open is a result of both intrinsic and extrinsic factors. In addition, we observed the change of identities over time among the entrepreneurs. We hope to use this paper as a pilot study of this emerging socio-technological phenomenon, which is understudied relative to the proprietary product commercialisation process.","[Li, Zhuoxuan; Eesley, Charles] Stanford Univ, Dept Management Sci & Engn, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Seering, Warren; Yang, Maria] MIT, Dept Mech Engn, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA",Stanford University; Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT),"Li, ZX (corresponding author), Stanford Univ, Dept Management Sci & Engn, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",zxli@standford.edu,"Eesley, Charles/N-7888-2016","Eesley, Charles/0000-0003-2348-1583",,,,,64,2,2,2,12,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",2053-4701,,,DES SCI,DES.

The developments of open-source hardware (OSH) and the contribution towards the creation of hardware-based accelerators with implication mainly in machine learning (ML), has also been significant. In particular, the reduced instruction-set computer-five (RISC-V) open standard architecture has been widely adopted by a community of researchers and commercial users, worldwide, in numerous openly available implementations. The selection through a plethora of RISC-V processor cores and the mix of architectures and configurations combined with the proliferation of ML software frameworks for ML workloads, is not trivial. In order to facilitate this process, this paper presents a survey focused on the assessment of the ecosystem that entails RISC-V based hardware for creating a classification of system-on-chip (SoC) and CPU cores, along with an inclusive arrangement of the latest released frameworks that have supported open hardware integration for ML applications. Moreover, part of this work is devoted to the challenges that are concerned, such as power efficiency and reliability, when designing and building application with OSH in the AI/ML domain.

Understanding inequality as a representation problem is valuable but does not necessarily unpack its mechanisms. Using an epistemic justice lens, I look at scientific instruments as sites of inequality by design in environmental studies. Even when in recent years we have seen an explosion of new scientific tools in the field, how these tools reproduce inequalities is underexplored. The open science hardware movement provides an opportunity for studying this question in practice. I present findings from qualitative research with two projects of the Gathering for Open Science Hardware (GOSH) community in Latin America during 2018-2022. These findings show how researchers use open science hardware to overcome structural inequalities in environmental research. Beyond their lower cost, researchers are using open hardware to enable new ideas and concepts to emerge through flexible and repairable designs. I describe four mechanisms that enable the creation of new epistemic resources: autonomy, flexibility, impact and resilience, and I identify significant limitations to this potential. In the context of ongoing policy discussions promoting wider adoption of low-cost environmental research tools, this work provides insights for seizing the transformative potential of openness towards more fair environmental science.","[Arancio, Julieta] Drexel Univ, Ctr Sci Technol & Soc, 3101 Market St, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA",Drexel University,"Arancio, J (corresponding author), Drexel Univ, Ctr Sci Technol & Soc, 3101 Market St, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA.",jca88@drexel.edu,,"Arancio, Julieta C./0000-0002-8624-4182",Alfred P.

Mobile learning has become an essential method that design makers should adopt. The main content of this study is to explore the characteristics of learning behaviors and learning needs of creative design makers' group in forming a community of practice in the era of mobile learning.Design/methodology/approachThis study conducted questionnaire research on the potentially associated or directly associated population of design makers. The process of the study also combined observational and interview studies to compensate for the lack of questionnaire research.FindingsBased on the support of mobile learning technology, design makers share and co-create to achieve individual development and evolution of learning organizations, and produce creative value. Design-maker communities of practice form common communities in the framework of informal organizations to support continuous individual learning. Convergent interests or concerns in making things, real-world contexts based on makerspaces and hands-on practice based on real projects are the basis for forming design-maker communities of practice. A variety of open-source hardware, software and platforms that can support mobile learning are important for the development of design-maker communities of practice. The design-maker community of practice needs group factors, activity development, physical and technical resources, spatial support and institutional norms to enhance learning behaviors and satisfy learning needs.Originality/valueThe discovery and construction of these associated factors can help creative design practitioners form a lasting and virtuous organizational development. This study facilitates the formation of a social network for learning and knowledge sharing among design-maker communities of practice. It enhances the innovation ability and enthusiasm of design makers according to the population characteristics and learning needs of design makers. This study also facilitates the generation of a positive adaptive maker culture and maker spirit within design maker organizations.","[Zhang, Xin; Hu, Jieming] Donghua Univ, Coll Fash & Design, Shanghai, Peoples R China",Donghua University,"Hu, JM (corresponding author), Donghua Univ, Coll Fash & Design, Shanghai, Peoples R China.",792345590@qq.com; 56419823@qq.com,"Hu, Jieming/GRY-5239-2022",,Prosperity Plan Pre-research Project of Donghua University-Multiple Evolution and System Construction of Open Design Maker Co-creation Field; Shanghai Summit Discipline in Design;  [2020Y003];  [DD18003],Prosperity Plan Pre-research Project of Donghua University-Multiple Evolution and System Construction of Open Design Maker Co-creation Field; Shanghai Summit Discipline in Design; ;,The authors thank Huang Haoxiang and Ding Xinyi of Donghua University for their help in this thesis research.

One way to support stronger end users' engagement with such complex technologies is by involving them in the design process and, with the advent of Arduino prototyping platform, even in their making. While DIY practice offers the potential for stronger user engagement with physical artifacts, we know little about end users' DIY practice of making complex electronic technologies and their potential to ensure engagement with such devices. In this article, we report on interviews with 18 participants from two green communities who built and used an open source DIY energy monitor, with the aim to explore the end users DIY practices of making such complex electronic devices. Findings indicate four key qualities of DIY monitors: transparent modularity, open-endedness, heirloom, and disruptiveness, and how they contribute to more meaningful engagement with the DIY monitors, elevating them from the status of unremarkable objects to that of things. We conclude with three implications for design for supporting end user development of complex electronic DIY: designing transparent open hardware technologies, standardizing communication protocols for the current and future DIY of IoT, and deliberately calling for personal investment and labor in the assembling of DIY kits.","[Sas, Corina] Univ Lancaster, Sch Comp & Commun, Lancaster LA1 4WA, England; [Neustaedter, Carman] Simon Fraser Univ, Sch Interact Arts Technol, 515 West Hastings St, Vancouver, BC V6B 5K3, Canada",Lancaster University; Simon Fraser University,"Sas, C (corresponding author), Univ Lancaster, Sch Comp & Commun, Lancaster LA1 4WA, England.",,"Sas, Corina/AAG-2837-2021","Sas, Corina/0000-0001-9297-9612","UK Research Council through the Catalyst project, (EPSRC) [EP/I033017/1]; EPSRC [EP/I033017/1] Funding Source: UKRI","UK Research Council through the Catalyst project, (EPSRC)(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)); EPSRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC))","This work was supported by the UK Research Council through the Catalyst project, (EPSRC Grant EP/I033017/1).",,94,26,30,0,12,ASSOC COMPUTING MACHINERY,NEW YORK,"1601 Broadway, 10th Floor, NEW YORK, NY USA",1073-0516,1557-7325,,ACM T COMPUT-HUM INT,ACM Trans.

Snowball sampling was used in this study to survey 300 people who work and have had experiences with online brand communities for open source hardware (OSHW) at Fab Lab Seoul. The findings of this study indicate that content, consumer support, user interface, and reward are among the five factors that trigger an online brand community to develop a social OSHW platform. However, this study also found that brand reputation was insignificant relative to activating a social media platform for open-source software. In addition, activating a social platform for OSHW can positively affect to the brand community's loyalty for OSHW, which means that social platform innovation for OSHW can help form the positive attitude necessary to develop and diffuse an OSHW culture in a rapidly changing ICT ecosystem. This can be an important strategy for OSHW business and can contribute to the growth of the IoT market in South Korea. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Digital manufacturing technologies have only recently become widespread and the return on investment (ROI) was not clear, so funding for open hardware development was historically sparse. This paper clarifies a method for determining an ROI for the development of scientific free and open source hardware (FOSH). By using an open source hardware design that can be manufactured digitally, the relatively minor development costs result in enormous ROIs for the scientific community. A case study is presented of a syringe pump released under open license, which results in ROIs for funders ranging from hundreds to thousands of percent after only a few months. It is clear that policies encouraging FOSH scientific hardware development should be adopted by organizations interested in maximizing return on public investments for science.","[Pearce, J.

Early research found substantial economic savings for these technologies, but as the open source design paradigm has grown by orders of magnitude it is possible that the savings observed in the early work was isolated to special cases. Today there are examples of open source technology for science in the vast majority of disciplines and several resources dedicated specifically to publishing them. Do the tremendous economic savings observed earlier hold today? To answer that question, this study evaluates free and open source technologies in the two repositories compared to proprietary functionally-equivalent tools as a function of their use of Arduino-based electronics, RepRap-class 3-D printing, as well as the combination of the two. The results of the review find overwhelming evidence for a wide range of scientific tools, that open source technologies provide economic savings of 87% compared to equivalent or lesser proprietary tools. These economic savings increased slightly to 89% for those that used Arduino technology and even more to 92% for those that used RepRap-class 3-D printing. Combining both Arduino and 3-D printing the savings averaged 94% for free and open source tools over commercial equivalents. The results provide strong evidence for financial support of open source hardware and software development for the sciences. Given the overwhelming economic advantages of free and open source technologies, it appears financially responsible to divert funding of proprietary scientific tools and their development in favor of FOSH. Policies were outlined that provide nations with a template for strategically harvesting the opportunities provided by the free and open source paradigm. (C) 2020 The Author.

This is done through distributed manufacturing, in which products are produced close to end users. There is anecdotal evidence that these opportunities are heavily geographically dependent, with some locations unable to acquire components to build open hardware at accessible prices because of trade restrictions, tariffs, taxes, or market availability. Supply chain disruptions during the COVID-19 pandemic exacerbated this and forced designers to pivot towards a la carte-style design frameworks for critical system components. To further develop this phenomenon, a case study of free and open-source solar photovoltaic (PV) racking systems is provided. Two similar open-source designs made from different materials are compared in terms of capital costs for their detailed bill of materials throughout ten locations in North, Central and South America. The differences in economic optimization showed that the costs of wood-based racks were superior in North America and in some South American countries, while metal was less costly in Central and South America. The results make it clear that open hardware designs would be best to allow for local optimization based on material availability in all designs.","[Rana, Shafquat; Powell, Jadyn; Pearce, Joshua M.] Western Univ, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, London, ON N6A 5B9, Canada; [Vandewetering, Nicholas] Western Univ, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, London, ON N6A 3K7, Canada; [Ariza, Jonathan alvarez] Engn Fac, Dept Technol Elect, Corp Universitaria Minuto Dios UNIMINUTO, Bogota 111021, Colombia; [Pearce, Joshua M.] Western Univ, Ivey Business Sch, London, ON N6G 0N1, Canada",Western University (University of Western Ontario); Western University (University of Western Ontario); Western University (University of Western Ontario),"Pearce, JM (corresponding author), Western Univ, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, London, ON N6A 5B9, Canada.; Pearce, JM (corresponding author), Western Univ, Ivey Business Sch, London, ON N6G 0N1, Canada.",nvandew@uwo.ca; jalvarez@uniminuto.edu,"Pearce, Joshua/C-9240-2013","Pearce, Joshua/0000-0001-9802-3056; Vandewetering, Nicholas/0000-0003-3901-3127; Alvarez Ariza, Jonathan/0000-0002-4024-1349",,,,,126,1,1,3,4,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2227-7080,,TECHNOLOGIES,Technologies,APR,2023,11,2,,,,,,,62,10.3390/technologies11020062,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/technologies11020062,,,17,"Engineering, Multidisciplinary",Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI),Engineering,E8KZ9,,gold,,,8/15/24,WOS:000977980400001,,1,25,,1,

Unfortunately, some 3-D printing manufacturing companies began deviating from open-source principles and violating licenses for the detriment of the community. To determine if a pattern has emerged of companies patenting clearly open-source innovations, this study presents three case studies from the three primary regions of open-source 3-D printing development (EU, U.S., and China) as well as three aspects of 3-D printing technology (AM materials, an open-source 3-D printer, and core open-source 3-D printing concepts used in most 3-D printers). The results of this review have shown that non-inventing entities, called patent parasites, are patenting open-source inventions already well-established in the open-source community and, in the most egregious cases, commercialized by one (or several) firm(s) at the time of the patent filing. Patent parasites are able to patent open-source innovations by using a different language, vague patent titles, and broad claims that encompass enormous swaths of widely diffused open-source innovation space. This practice poses a severe threat to innovation, and several approaches to irradicate the threat are discussed.","[Kulkarni, Apoorv; Pearce, Joshua M.] Western Univ, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, 1151 Richmond St N, London, ON N6A 3K7, Canada; [Pearce, Joshua M.] Western Univ, Ivey Sch Business, 1151 Richmond St N, London, ON N6A 3K7, Canada",Western University (University of Western Ontario); Western University (University of Western Ontario),"Pearce, JM (corresponding author), Western Univ, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, 1151 Richmond St N, London, ON N6A 3K7, Canada.; Pearce, JM (corresponding author), Western Univ, Ivey Sch Business, 1151 Richmond St N, London, ON N6A 3K7, Canada.",apoorv.kulkarni@uwo.ca; joshua.pearce@uwo.ca,"Pearce, Joshua/D-2052-2010","Pearce, Joshua/0000-0001-9802-3056",Thompson Endowment,Thompson Endowment,No Statement Available,,135,0,0,1,1,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2411-5134,,INVENTIONS-BASEL,Inventions,DEC,2023,8,6,,,,,,,141,10.3390/inventions8060141,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/inventions8060141,,,20,"Engineering, Multidisciplinary",Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI),Engineering,DG3W4,,"Green Submitted, gold",,,8/15/24,WOS:001130846400001,,1,26,,1,

Medical devices play an important role in managing acute and chronic respiratory failure, including diagnosis, monitoring, and providing artificial ventilation. Current commercially available respiratory devices are very effective but, given their cost, are unaffordable for most patients in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). Herein, we focus on a relatively new design option-the open-source hardware approach-that, if implemented, will contribute to providing low-cost respiratory medical devices for many patients in LMICs, particularly those without full medical insurance coverage. Open source reflects a set of approaches to conceive and distribute the comprehensive technical information required for building devices. The open-source approach enables free and unrestricted use of the know-how to replicate and manufacture the device or modify its design for improvements or adaptation to different clinical settings or personalized treatments. We describe recent examples of open-source devices for diagnosis/monitoring (measuring inspiratory/expiratory pressures or flow and volume in mechanical ventilators) and for therapy (non-invasive ventilators for adults and continuous positive airway pressure support for infants) that enable building simple, low-cost (hence, affordable), and high-performance solutions for patients in LMICs. Finally, we argue that the common practice of approving clinical trials by the local hospital ethics board can be expanded to ensure patient safety by reviewing, inspecting, and approving open hardware for medical application to maximize the innovation and deployment rate of medical technologies.","[Farre, Ramon] Univ Barcelona, Fac Med & Ciencies Salut, Unitat Biofis & Bioengn, Barcelona 08036, Spain; [Farre, Ramon] CIBER Enfermedades Resp, Madrid 28029, Spain; [Farre, Ramon] Inst Invest Biomed August Pi Sunyer, Barcelona 08036, Spain; [Gozal, David] Univ Missouri, Dept Child Hlth, Sch Med, Columbia, MO 65201 USA; [Viet-Nhung Nguyen] Natl TB Program, 463 Hoang Hoa Tham, Hanoi 118000, Vietnam; [Pearce, Joshua M.] Western Univ, Ivey Business Sch, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, London, ON N6A 5B9, Canada; [Anh Tuan Dinh-Xuan] Hop Cochin, AP HP, Serv Physiol Explorat Fonct, F-75014 Paris, France",University of Barcelona; CIBER - Centro de Investigacion Biomedica en Red; CIBERES; University of Barcelona; Hospital Clinic de Barcelona; IDIBAPS; University of Missouri System; University of Missouri Columbia; Western University (University of Western Ontario); Assistance Publique Hopitaux Paris (APHP); Universite Paris Cite; Hopital Universitaire Cochin - APHP,"Farr√©, R (corresponding author), Univ Barcelona, Fac Med & Ciencies Salut, Unitat Biofis & Bioengn, Barcelona 08036, Spain.; Farr√©, R (corresponding author), CIBER Enfermedades Resp, Madrid 28029, Spain.; Farr√©, R (corresponding author), Inst Invest Biomed August Pi Sunyer, Barcelona 08036, Spain.",rfarre@ub.edu,"DINH-XUAN, Anh Tuan/A-9691-2008; Farre, Ramon/L-2664-2017; Pearce, Joshua/C-9240-2013","DINH-XUAN, Anh Tuan/0000-0001-8651-5176; Gozal, David/0000-0001-8195-6036; Farre, Ramon/0000-0002-9084-7824; Pearce, Joshua/0000-0001-9802-3056",Thompson Endowment andWestern Frugal Biomedical Innovation,Thompson Endowment andWestern Frugal Biomedical Innovation,This research was partially supported by the Thompson Endowment andWestern Frugal Biomedical Innovation.,,80,4,4,1,11,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2075-4426,,J PERS MED,J.

One of the most fundamental questions relating to these phenomena is why developers contribute their private resources to these public goods. While this question has been discussed, theorized, and empirically investigated in the context of OSS, there has been no research so far in the context of OSH. Can we really assume the motivations behind the development of the OSH to be the same as those behind OSS? Based on the self&#8208;determination theory (SDT), we provide original insights into the motivations behind contributions to OSH development. We collected data from the most common and active 3D printing communities, which are the main loci of OSH development. We thus have a unique cross&#8208;sectional data set with participants from over 30 different countries using all kinds of different OSH platforms. Our analysis reveals several important findings: firstly, the motivations are in some aspects very similar to those in open source software notwithstanding different possibilities, hurdles, and incentives regarding the OSS and OSH. Above all, enjoyment&#8208;based intrinsic motivation is a major factor affecting contribution levels. Secondly, among internalized extrinsic motivations, expected private benefits through improving own skills stands out. Thirdly, different factors of internalized extrinsic motivations can have different moderating effects on the effect of enjoyment&#8208;based intrinsic motivation. Given the imminent changes in business models throughout manufacturing industries in order to adapt to the challenge that OSH will increasingly pose, our findings have important implications not only for OSH communities and 3D development platforms, but also for businesses that want and probably soon have to engage in open innovation.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,720,,,

Although promising, each base station needs accurate estimation of the channel state information (CSI), either through feedback or channel reciprocity schemes in order to achieve the benefits of massive MIMO in practice. Time division duplex (TDD) has been suggested as a better mode to acquire timely CSI in massive MIMO systems. The use of non-orthogonal pilot schemes, proposed for channel estimation in multi-cell TDD networks, is considered as a major source of pilot contamination in the literature due to the limitations of coherence time. Given the importance of pilot contamination in massive MIMO systems, we provide an extensive survey on pilot contamination, and identify other possible sources of pilot contamination, which include hardware impairment and non-reciprocal transceivers. We review established theories that have analyzed the effect of pilot contamination on the performance of massive MIMO systems, particularly on achievable rates. Next, we categorize the different proposed mitigation techniques for pilot contamination using the following taxonomy: pilot-based approach and subspace-based approach. Finally, we highlight the open issues, such as training overhead, deployment scenario, computational complexity, use of channel reciprocity, and conclude with broader perspective and a look at future trends in pilot contamination in massive MIMO systems.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,811,,,

Such firm strategies are now common for open source software and other information goods. However, they pose conceptual and practical uncertainties for hardware-focused companies, particularly as research on open hardware has emphasized community rather than firm success. Here we study firm openness in 3D printing, with a case study of how MakerBot Industries leveraged external communities and selective openness become the consumer market leader. After reviewing the literature on systemic innovation and selective openness, we document the proprietary strategies of a dozen startup companies during the first two decades of the 3D printing industry. We contrast this to the open hardware, software and content strategy that MakerBot's founders used to enter and grow the consumer market from 2009 onward. We show how MakerBot shifted to a selectively open, systemic innovation strategy that complemented proprietary hardware and software with open user-generated content from its Thingiverse online community. From this, we suggest the inherent complementarity of selective openness strategies between open and proprietary components, and conclude with predictions as to when and how a startup or incumbent firm will combine open and proprietary elements.

Hardware released under free licenses is known as free and open source hardware (FOSH). The availability of these FOSH designs has a large value to those with access to digital manufacturing methods and particularly for scientists with needs for highly-customized low-volume production products. It is challenging to use traditional funding models to support the necessary investment of resources in FOSH development because of the difficulty in quantifying the value of the result. In order to overcome that challenge and harvest the current opportunity in both low-cost scientific equipment and consumer products, this article evaluates the following methods to quantify the value of FOSH design including: 1) downloaded substitution valuation; 2) avoided reproduction valuation and 3) market savings valuation along with additional benefits related to market expansion, scientific innovation acceleration, educational enhancement and medical care improvement. The strengths and weaknesses of these methods are analyzed and the results show that the methods are relatively straight-forward to institute, based on reliable freely-available data, and that they minimize assumptions. A case study of a syringe pump with numerous scientific and medical applications is presented. The results found millions of dollars of economic value from a relatively simple scientific device being released under open-licenses representing orders of magnitude increase in value from conventional proprietary development. The inescapable conclusion of this study is that FOSH development should be funded by organizations interested in maximizing return on public investments particularly in technologies associated with science, medicine and education.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,911,,,

This is done through distributed manufacturing, in which products are produced close to end users. There is anecdotal evidence that these opportunities are heavily geographically dependent, with some locations unable to acquire components to build open hardware at accessible prices because of trade restrictions, tariffs, taxes, or market availability. Supply chain disruptions during the COVID-19 pandemic exacerbated this and forced designers to pivot towards a la carte-style design frameworks for critical system components. To further develop this phenomenon, a case study of free and open-source solar photovoltaic (PV) racking systems is provided. Two similar open-source designs made from different materials are compared in terms of capital costs for their detailed bill of materials throughout ten locations in North, Central and South America. The differences in economic optimization showed that the costs of wood-based racks were superior in North America and in some South American countries, while metal was less costly in Central and South America. The results make it clear that open hardware designs would be best to allow for local optimization based on material availability in all designs.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,1112,,,

This trend has increased attention to open source hardware (OSH): a phenomenon that extends the intellectual property management and development practices in open source software (OSS) into the design of physical objects. OSH projects are different from OSS projects due to product type, and distinct from traditional closed source new product development (NPD) ones due to their openness. These differences challenge the degree of applicability of existing project success definitions in the OSH context. To investigate project success in OSH, we conducted a qualitative survey with practitioners. We report characteristics of successful OSH projects through three identified themes: (a) value creation - the big-picture impact, (b) quality of output - the quality of the hardware and accompanying documentation and (c) project process - activities that contribute to success. We contextualise by comparing OSH with selected literature on the success of OSS and NPD project management. While our study confirms a similarity between OSS and OSH in defining project success, it also highlights themes that are uniquely important to the latter. These findings are helpful for OSH development practice and could provide lessons for OSS development and closed source NPD.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,1140,,,

However, a common belief is that the greater economic cost and complexity of hybrid digital objects (i.e., digital objects with both hardware and software) precludes their development with open source methods traditionally used for software. We study a sophisticated OSH named White Rabbit initiated at CERN and developed through a vibrant and heterogenous open source community. Our findings show that the assumption that hardware and software require fundamentally distinctive development and production modes should be replaced with a more nuanced differentiation characterized by three main attributes describing an object's composition: embodiment, modularity, and granularity. Taken together, these three attributes determine how a hybrid object is developed throughout its evolution in an open source community. Our research offers several contributions. First, we provide a more nuanced view of the consequences of the material embodiment of hardware. Once considered a simple deterrent to open source development, we describe how economic cost is subordinate to more influential aspects of an object's physical layers: as the open source community modifies the object to accommodate the operating requirements of diverse physical instantiations, such modifications can be incorporated in the logical design covered by the open source license. Additionally, we show how embodiment, modularity, and granularity progress through the object's evolution and how this maturation subsequently affects development modes. We trace the implications of our findings for hybrids and digital object conceptualizations in IS research, open source development and, more broadly, normative implications for OSH in scientific and commercial computing.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,1146,,,

Fab labs/makerspaces as openly accessible facilities with local communities of makers have the potential to act as catalysts to mature and disseminate OSH development collaboratively. In the Horizon 2020 project OPENNEXT, 17 case studies were implemented in four clusters where makerspaces worked together with small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) for a limited time to provide new pathways for OSH co-creation and sharing. Various consumer goods industries, such as electronics, furniture, and mobility amongst others, were in focus.

Open source technology has enormous potential to spur innovation and enhance technological literacy and thus contribute to socioeconomic and ecological sustainability.¬†Like in software, open source hardware (OSH) projects and online communities have evolved in a broad range of technologies and applications. In these communities, people from all over the world with diverse backgrounds (students, researchers, consumers, users etc.) gather online to jointly develop, revise, improve and freely share hardware designs and documentation. Additionally, people may build, adapt, use and sell physical artefacts based on these designs in accordance with the notion of open source. The (potential) economic impact and value of open source hardware is hard to quantify as contributors usually do not get paid and users do not necessarily buy products from vendors. Nonetheless, value is created as in the case of Linux or Wikipedia. We applied established valuation methods for open source hardware to quantify cost savings and as a result the value of an open source magnetic resonance imaging device (MRI) currently under development by the Open Source Imaging Initiative (OSI2).

Understanding inequality as a representation problem is valuable but does not necessarily unpack its mechanisms. Using an epistemic justice lens, I look at scientific instruments as sites of inequality by design in environmental studies. Even when in recent years we have seen an explosion of new scientific tools in the field, how these tools reproduce inequalities is underexplored. The open science hardware movement provides an opportunity for studying this question in practice. I present findings from qualitative research with two projects of the Gathering for Open Science Hardware (GOSH) community in Latin America during 2018-2022. These findings show how researchers use open science hardware to overcome structural inequalities in environmental research. Beyond their lower cost, researchers are using open hardware to enable new ideas and concepts to emerge through flexible and repairable designs. I describe four mechanisms that enable the creation of new epistemic resources: autonomy, flexibility, impact and resilience, and I identify significant limitations to this potential.

However, three decades ago, the medical community started to consider repurposing ultrasound scanners to improve physical examinations. A broad community of healthcare professionals trained in the new clinical examination paradigm could not be created due to the very high price of portable ultrasound scanners available on the market. In this paper, we study an Open-Source Hardware (OSH) community that aims to improve diagnosis in hospitals and medically underserved areas worldwide. They are designing an echo-stethoscope - a portable ultrasound scanner - that would be affordable in low and middle-income countries. The variety of expertise pooled to achieve this objective puts this knowledge common (KC) at the crossroads of open-source software (OSS), OSH, and medical communities. Unlike typical KC outcomes, an ultrasound probe is a physical object. Development and innovation in the physical world bring social dilemmas that the community has to overcome, restrictions in terms of openness, and in this case, unintended privatization. Our study uses the governing knowledge common framework (GKCF), a modified institutional analysis and development framework, to untangle the interactions between resources, participants, and governance structures. Our research describes why and how the creation of a physical object subject to industry regulation influences the evolution and governance of the KC. We provide evidence that temporary privatization of the KC can be used as a way to protect and sustain a common during the industrialization phase. We also demonstrate how a portfolio of projects is an effective and resilient way to help the common survive this privatization step.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,1934,,,

However, open source (hardware) design implies a tremendous change in both design practices and philosophy because it is partly related to the movements of creative commons and the sharing economy. From this perspective one could think that participation is crucial in the success of open source design projects. In this paper, we analyse 9 case studies in the light of 3 hypotheses. If many studies highlight the potential of the crowd as a resource for design tasks, our study shows that for open source design communities the participation is not massive. In this study, we used an activity-based approach to build our model. As open source design processes are fairly unstructured and based on voluntary participation, it is impossible to adopt a classical task-based model. With the help of this model, we were able evaluate the overall size of the active community, the participation rate with regards to the activities.

Peer-production and contribution cultures are enfolded in a dynamic of resistance and appropriation in relation to capitalism. Open-source and contribution-based cultural processes have been critiqued as tending towards bureaucracy or becoming enfolded in a never-ending neoliberal imaginary from which escape or transcendence become impossible. An examination of the values expressed within a peer-production community challenges these perspectives and shows how ""operational pragmatics"" can provide moral justifications through reference to matters of principle and matters of design. Conflating these matters complicates claims about the inherent virtues of participation, especially in technical cultures. A qualitative analysis of an open-source hardware project shows how competing moral justifications unfold, and how the challenges that they pose to capitalism may be tenuous or temporary because of the way that justificatory regimes work within technology development under capitalism.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,1936,,,

One way to support stronger end users' engagement with such complex technologies is by involving them in the design process and, with the advent of Arduino prototyping platform, even in their making. While DIY practice offers the potential for stronger user engagement with physical artifacts, we know little about end users' DIY practice of making complex electronic technologies and their potential to ensure engagement with such devices. In this article, we report on interviews with 18 participants from two green communities who built and used an open source DIY energy monitor, with the aim to explore the end users DIY practices of making such complex electronic devices. Findings indicate four key qualities of DIY monitors: transparent modularity, open-endedness, heirloom, and disruptiveness, and how they contribute to more meaningful engagement with the DIY monitors, elevating them from the status of unremarkable objects to that of things. We conclude with three implications for design for supporting end user development of complex electronic DIY: designing transparent open hardware technologies, standardizing communication protocols for the current and future DIY of IoT, and deliberately calling for personal investment and labor in the assembling of DIY kits.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,649,,,
