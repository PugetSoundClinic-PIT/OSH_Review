The widespread availability of open-source hardware together with novel analytical methods based on pulsed flows have opened the possibility of implementing standalone automated analytical systems at low cost. Among the areas that can benefit from this approach are the analysis of industrial products and effluents and environmental analysis. In this work, a multi-pumping flow system is proposed for the determination of phosphorus in effluents and polluted water samples. The system employs photometric detection based on the formation of molybdovanadophosphoric acid, and the fluidic circuit is built using three solenoid micropumps. The detection is implemented with a low cost LED-photodiode photometric detection system and the whole system is controlled by an open-source Arduino Uno microcontroller board. The optimization of the timing to ensure the color development and the pumping cycle is discussed for the proposed implementation. Experimental results to evaluate the system behavior are presented verifying a linear relationship between the relative absorbance and the phosphorus concentrations for levels as high as 50 mg L-1.","[Gonzalez, Pablo; Knochen, Moises] Univ La Republ, Fac Quim, Quim Analit, Montevideo 11800, Uruguay; [Perez, Nicolas] Univ La Republ, Ctr Univ Paysandu, Ruta 3 Km 363, Paysandu 60000, Uruguay","Universidad de la Republica, Uruguay; Universidad de la Republica, Uruguay","Knochen, M (corresponding author), Univ La Republ, Fac Quim, Quim Analit, Montevideo 11800, Uruguay.",mknochen@fq.edu.uy,"Alvarez, Nicolas/GWQ-8755-2022","Knochen, Moises/0000-0001-9263-7428; Perez, Nicolas/0000-0002-8043-5383",Programa de Desarrollo de Ciencias Basicas (PEDECIBA); Agencia Nacional de Investigacion e Innovacion (ANII); Universidad de la Republica (UdelaR),Programa de Desarrollo de Ciencias Basicas (PEDECIBA); Agencia Nacional de Investigacion e Innovacion (ANII); Universidad de la Republica (UdelaR),The authors thank Programa de Desarrollo de Ciencias Basicas (PEDECIBA) for support.

In this paper, a modular hardware platform allowing to prototype, test and even implement IoT appliances on low-cost reconfigurable devices is presented. The proposed platform, named Dracon, includes a Z80-clone microprocessor, up to 64 KB of RAM, and 256 inputs/outputs (I/Os). These I/Os can be used to connect additional co-processors within the same FPGA, external co-processors, communications modules, sensors and actuators. Dracon also includes as default peripherals a UART for programming and accessing the microprocessor, a Real Time Clock, and an Interrupt Timer. The use of an 8-bit microprocessor allows the use of the internal memory of the reconfigurable device as program memory, thereby, enabling the implementation of a complete IoT device within a single low-cost chip. Indeed, results using a Spartan 7 FPGA show that it is possible to implement Dracon with only 1515 6-input LUTs while operating at a maximum frequency of 80 MHz, which results in a better trade-off in terms of area and performance than other less powerful and less versatile alternatives in the literature. Moreover, the presented platform allows the development of embedded software applications independently of the selected FPGA device, enabling rapid prototyping and implementations on devices from different manufacturers.","[Parrilla, Luis; Garcia, Antonio; Castillo, Encarnacion; Lopez-Villanueva, Juan Antonio] Univ Granada, Dept Elect & Tecnol Comp, Granada 18071, Spain; [Alvarez-Bermejo, Jose Antonio] Univ Almeria, Dept Informat, Almeria 04120, Spain; [Meyer-Baese, Uwe] FAMU FSU Coll Engn, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, Tallahassee, FL 32310 USA",University of Granada; Universidad de Almeria; State University System of Florida; Florida State University; Florida A&M University,"Parrilla, L (corresponding author), Univ Granada, Dept Elect & Tecnol Comp, Granada 18071, Spain.",lparrilla@ditec.ugr.es; grios@ugr.es; encas@ugr.es; jaberme@ual.es; jalopez@ugr.es; umb@eng.famu.fsu.edu,"Castillo, Encarnación/ACP-5061-2022; Castillo, Encarnacion/D-9975-2012; García, Antonio/C-6070-2012; Parrilla Roure, Luis/C-2439-2012; Meyer-Baese, Uwe/L-7388-2014; Lopez Villanueva, Juan A./C-2418-2012; Alvarez Bermejo, Jose Antonio/M-1691-2014","Castillo, Encarnación/0000-0001-6476-8105; Castillo, Encarnacion/0000-0001-6476-8105; García, Antonio/0000-0003-3533-4660; Parrilla Roure, Luis/0000-0001-8126-1146; Meyer-Baese, Uwe/0000-0001-8130-9963; Lopez Villanueva, Juan A./0000-0003-0334-0863; Alvarez Bermejo, Jose Antonio/0000-0002-5815-7858",Consejeria de Economia y Conocimiento de la Junta de Andalucia (Spain); European Regional Development Funds (ERDF) [B-TIC-588-UGR20],Consejeria de Economia y Conocimiento de la Junta de Andalucia (Spain)(Junta de Andalucia); European Regional Development Funds (ERDF)(European Union (EU)),This work was partially supported by the Consejeria de Economia y Conocimiento de la Junta de Andalucia (Spain) and by the European Regional Development Funds (ERDF) under Project B-TIC-588-UGR20.,,61,3,3,3,8,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2079-9292,,ELECTRONICS-SWITZ,Electronics,JUL,2022,11,13,,,,,,,2080,10.3390/electronics11132080,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/electronics11132080,,,18,"Computer Science, Information Systems; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Physics, Applied",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Computer Science; Engineering; Physics,2V2FF,,"Green Submitted, Green Published, gold",,,8/15/24,WOS:000823665600001,,0,2228,,1,

Although a number of platforms have been specifically designed for the general public and are supported by a vast array of on-line tutorials, this subject is not normally included in university chemistry curricula. Aiming to provide the basic concepts of hardware and software, this article is focused on the design and use of a simple module to control a series of PDMS-based valves. The module is based on a low-cost microprocessor (Teensy) and open-source software (Arduino). The microvalves were fabricated using thin sheets of PDMS and patterned using CO2 laser engraving, providing a simple and efficient way to fabricate devices without the traditional photolithographic process or facilities. Synchronization of valve control enabled the development of two simple devices to perform injection (1.6 +/- 0.4 mu L/stroke) and mixing of different solutions. Furthermore, a practical demonstration of the utility of this system for microscale chemical sample handling and analysis was achieved performing an on-chip acid-base titration, followed by conductivity detection with an open-source low-cost detection system. Overall, the system provided a very reproducible (98%) platform to perform fluid delivery at the microfluidic scale.","[da Costa, Eric Tavares; Garcia, Carlos D.] Univ Texas San Antonio, Dept Chem, San Antonio, TX 78248 USA; [da Costa, Eric Tavares; do Lago, Claudimir L.] Univ Sao Paulo, Dept Quim Fundamental, Inst Quim, Sao Paulo, Brazil; [Mora, Maria F.; Willis, Peter A.] CALTECH, Jet Prop Lab, Pasadena, CA USA; [Jiao, Hong] HJ Sci & Technol, Berkeley, CA USA",University of Texas System; University of Texas at San Antonio (UTSA); Universidade de Sao Paulo; National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA); NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL); California Institute of Technology,"Garcia, CD (corresponding author), Univ Texas San Antonio, Dept Chem, One UTSA Circle, San Antonio, TX 78248 USA.",carlos.garcia@utsa.edu,"do Lago, Claudimir Lucio/A-1852-2008; Mora, Maria Fernanda/C-9753-2009; Garcia, Carlos/A-8681-2008; Mora, Maria Fernanda/T-5832-2019; Willis, Peter Athol/I-6621-2012; da Costa, Eric tavares/D-5387-2012","do Lago, Claudimir Lucio/0000-0003-1542-4343; Garcia, Carlos/0000-0002-7583-5585; Willis, Peter Athol/0000-0001-5394-1101; da Costa, Eric tavares/0000-0003-4489-3501; Mora, Maria/0000-0002-6341-8485",NASA STTR [NNX13CP49C]; University of Texas at San Antonio; National Institutes of Health through the Research Centers at Minority Institutions [G12MD007591],NASA STTR; University of Texas at San Antonio; National Institutes of Health through the Research Centers at Minority Institutions,"The authors gratefully acknowledge the financial support provided by NASA STTR (Contract number: NNX13CP49C), The University of Texas at San Antonio, and the National Institutes of Health through the Research Centers at Minority Institutions (G12MD007591).",,49,39,48,1,101,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0173-0835,1522-2683,,ELECTROPHORESIS,Electrophoresis,AUG,2014,35,16,,,SI,,2370,2377,,10.1002/elps.201400128,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/elps.201400128,,,8,"Biochemical Research Methods; Chemistry, Analytical",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Biochemistry & Molecular Biology; Chemistry,AN2DU,24823494,Green Accepted,,,8/15/24,WOS:000340394800013,,0,2230,,1,

The apparition of personal 3D printers is bringing the open source philosophy to the fabrication of physical things as well.

In this paper we are presenting the C++ Object Oriented Mechanics Library (OOML), a tool to design mechanical components, taking into account the needs and requirements of these emerging technologies. These designs can be easily shared, reused, and modified. The OOML brings together the advantages of (1) modelling things through code, (2) the object oriented programming paradigm, and (3) the power of C++. In the OOML, mechanical parts are described as geometrical combinations of basic primitives. Once a part is defined, fabrication files can be generated in order to print, or mechanize it.

Design/methodology/approach - This argument is based on three pillars. The first one refers to a bibliographic review of theoretical frameworks related to academic entrepreneurship and technological innovation to emphasize the disruptive innovation capacity of academia. Second, a few elements related to the Brazilian political, economic and structural scenario, which entail a (more) favorable environment to technological innovation and academic entrepreneurship, is presented. Finally, concepts related to OSH and its business model are approached to demonstrate the facilitating effect toward the whole process. Findings - As a result of the argument made herein, it is possible to perceive the viability of the OSH model in terms of entrepreneurship and technological innovation in the academic sphere, and to perceive its benefits before social and economic needs in areas such as health and education. Research limitations/implications - There are no empirical or quantifiable data in the literature that enable comparison between OSH and traditional technological innovation models. Originality/value - The considerations on the philosophical value of OSH and its business models are scarcely explored in international literature. As far as we know, relating OSH to technological innovation entrepreneurship in the academic sphere, as well as its singularities in Brazil regarding the innovation national system and social and economic demands, is a unique approach in literature.","[Cota, Vinicius Rosa] Univ Fed Sao Joao Del Rei, Lab Interdisciplinar Neuroengn & Neurociencias, Dept Engn Eletr, Sao Joao Del Rei, Brazil; [Aguiar, Cleiton Lopes] Univ Fed Minas Gerais, Nucleo Neurociencias, Dept Fisiol & Biofis, Inst Ciencias Biol, Belo Horizonte, MG, Brazil; [Neto, Bezamat de Souza] Univ Fed Sao Joao Del Rei, Dept Ciencias Adm & Contabeis, Sao Joao Del Rei, Brazil; [Benegas, Miguel] Univ Nacl Gen Sarmiento, Inst Ind, Los Polvorines, Argentina",Universidade Federal de Sao Joao del-Rei; Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais; Universidade Federal de Sao Joao del-Rei,"Cota, VR (corresponding author), Univ Fed Sao Joao Del Rei, Lab Interdisciplinar Neuroengn & Neurociencias, Dept Engn Eletr, Sao Joao Del Rei, Brazil.",vrcota@ufsj.edu.br,"Cota, Vinícius Rosa/F-1752-2018; Lopes Aguiar, Cleiton/B-3776-2018","Cota, Vinícius Rosa/0000-0002-2338-5949; Lopes Aguiar, Cleiton/0000-0001-9310-6338",,,,,72,3,3,2,21,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",2515-8961,,,INNOV MANAG REV,Innov.

However, a common belief is that the greater economic cost and complexity of hybrid digital objects (i.e., digital objects with both hardware and software) precludes their development with open source methods traditionally used for software. We study a sophisticated OSH named White Rabbit initiated at CERN and developed through a vibrant and heterogenous open source community. Our findings show that the assumption that hardware and software require fundamentally distinctive development and production modes should be replaced with a more nuanced differentiation characterized by three main attributes describing an object's composition: embodiment, modularity, and granularity. Taken together, these three attributes determine how a hybrid object is developed throughout its evolution in an open source community. Our research offers several contributions. First, we provide a more nuanced view of the consequences of the material embodiment of hardware. Once considered a simple deterrent to open source development, we describe how economic cost is subordinate to more influential aspects of an object's physical layers: as the open source community modifies the object to accommodate the operating requirements of diverse physical instantiations, such modifications can be incorporated in the logical design covered by the open source license. Additionally, we show how embodiment, modularity, and granularity progress through the object's evolution and how this maturation subsequently affects development modes. We trace the implications of our findings for hybrids and digital object conceptualizations in IS research, open source development and, more broadly, normative implications for OSH in scientific and commercial computing.","[Priego, Laia Pujol; Wareham, Jonathan] Ramon Llull Univ, ESADE Business Sch, Barcelona, Spain",Universitat Ramon Llull; Escuela Superior de Administracion y Direccion de Empresas (ESADE),"Priego, LP (corresponding author), Ramon Llull Univ, ESADE Business Sch, Barcelona, Spain.",Laia.pujol@esade.edu; Jonathan.wareham@esade.edu,,"Wareham, Jonathan/0000-0002-5816-7140; Pujol Priego, Laia/0000-0001-6796-729X",,,,,97,2,2,37,64,SOC INFORM MANAGE-MIS RES CENT,MINNEAPOLIS,"UNIV MINNESOTA-SCH MANAGEMENT 271 19TH AVE SOUTH, MINNEAPOLIS, MN 55455 USA",0276-7783,,,MIS QUART,MIS Q.,JUN,2023,47,2,,,,,639,667,,10.25300/MISQ/2022/16733,http://dx.doi.org/10.25300/MISQ/2022/16733,,,29,"Computer Science, Information Systems; Information Science & Library Science; Management",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Computer Science; Information Science & Library Science; Business & Economics,T2YS6,,hybrid,,,8/15/24,WOS:001076697300006,conceptual? ,0,2242,,1,

To facilitate mass collaboration and accelerate progress, many groups have adopted open-source development models, inspired by the long history of open-source development in software. According to the Open-source Hardware Association (OSHWA), Open-source Hardware (OSH) is a term for tangible artifacts - machines, devices, or other physical things - whose design has been released to the public in such a way that anyone can make, modify, and use them. One major obstacle to translating the growing body of work on open-source ventilators into clinical practice is compliance with regulations and conformance with mandated technical standards for effective performance and device safety. This is exacerbated by the inherent complexity of the regulatory process, which is tailored to traditional centralized development models, as well as the rapid changes and alternative pathways that have emerged during the pandemic. As a step in addressing this challenge, this paper provides developers, evaluators, and potential users of emergency ventilators with the first iteration of a pragmatic, open-source assessment framework that incorporates existing regulatory guidelines from Australia, Canada, UK and USA. We also provide an example evaluation for one open-source emergency ventilator design. The evaluation process has been divided into three levels: 1. Adequacy of open-source project documentation; 2. Clinical performance requirements, and 3. Conformance with technical standards.(c) 2022 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Such firm strategies are now common for open source software and other information goods. However, they pose conceptual and practical uncertainties for hardware-focused companies, particularly as research on open hardware has emphasized community rather than firm success. Here we study firm openness in 3D printing, with a case study of how MakerBot Industries leveraged external communities and selective openness become the consumer market leader. After reviewing the literature on systemic innovation and selective openness, we document the proprietary strategies of a dozen startup companies during the first two decades of the 3D printing industry. We contrast this to the open hardware, software and content strategy that MakerBot's founders used to enter and grow the consumer market from 2009 onward. We show how MakerBot shifted to a selectively open, systemic innovation strategy that complemented proprietary hardware and software with open user-generated content from its Thingiverse online community.

Openness is viewed as one of the key principles of the maker movement. As the global maker movement is a bricolage of diverse and situated practices and traditions, there are also many different interpretations and ways of practicing openness. We have explored this diversity with an integrative literature review, relying on the Web of Science (TM) database. We identified three interrelated but also, in part, mutually contested approaches to openness. Firstly, openness often refers to applying open hardware. Secondly, it is in many cases related to the inclusion and empowerment of various groups in making. Thirdly, openness appears to be seen as a means to pursue economic growth through increasing innovation activity and entrepreneurship. Our results also highlight the substantial barriers encountered by makers while aiming to open up their practices. These barriers include: value conflicts in which openness is overridden by other important values; exclusion of lower income groups from making due to a lack of resources; and difficulties in maintaining long-term activities. The different meanings of openness together with the barriers create tensions within the maker movement while implementing openness. We propose that engaging in a reflexive futures dialogue on the consequences of these tensions can enhance the maker movement to become more open, inclusive and resilient.","[Saari, Hanna; akerman, Maria; Myllyoja, Jouko] VTT Tech Res Ctr Finland, Espoo 02044, Finland; [Kieslinger, Barbara] Ctr Social Innovat, A-1150 Vienna, Austria; [Sipos, Regina] Tech Univ Berlin, Inst Vocat Educ & Work Studies, D-10623 Berlin, Germany",VTT Technical Research Center Finland; Technical University of Berlin,"Saari, H (corresponding author), VTT Tech Res Ctr Finland, Espoo 02044, Finland.",kieslinger@zsi.at; kieslinger@zsi.at; kieslinger@zsi.at; jouko.myllyoja@vtt.fi; sipos@tu-berlin.de,"Sipos, Regina/KXR-3040-2024","Sipos, Regina/0000-0002-8812-2082; Saari, Hanna/0000-0001-5856-3146; Akerman, Maria/0000-0001-6895-3375; Kieslinger, Barbara/0000-0002-0671-1917",,,,,69,4,4,6,19,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2071-1050,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,DEC,2021,13,24,,,,,,,13559,10.3390/su132413559,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su132413559,,,20,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,ZX8GY,,"Green Published, gold",,,8/15/24,WOS:000772131900001,review ,0,2245,,1,

This paper examines the GOSH movement's emergence and main features through the lens of transitions theory and the grassroots innovation movements framework. GOSH is here described embedded in the context of the wider open hardware movement and analyzed in terms of framings that inform it, spaces opened up for action and strategies developed to open them.

Two case studies are presented to illustrate three interlocked practices of this model for degrowth. It is argued that a ""design global, manufacture local"" model, as exemplified by these case studies, seems to arise in a significantly different political economy from that of the conventional industrial model of mass production.

The review investigates how studies are framed as open design and open-source design (including 'open hardware'): how researchers contribute to conceptual theorizing about open design or study its practical operationalization, in do-it-yourself 'making,' manufacturing and practices in-between these domains. Most of the papers reviewed were empirical studies from diverse fields. Open design was analyzed not only as contributions and solutions, but also as open-to-participate processes, openly shared processes, and open, closed, and modular (open and closed) outcomes. Various research fields presented an open design framing as an alternative to the status quo: new ways to do business and/or to foster socio-environmental sustainability. On the manufacturing side, open design was sought especially to accelerate innovation cycles; on the making side, it was espoused to foster democratization. However, the studies reviewed indicated that companies do not appear to develop much beyond business-as-usual. From the research perspective, the conceptual potential of open design to promote sustainability saw little practical exploration. Additionally, issues around open design community governance and ownership, safety and reliability of open outcomes require further investigation.","[Bakirlioglu, Yekta] Univ Limerick, Sch Design, Design Factors Res Grp, Limerick, Ireland; [Kohtala, Cindy] Aalto Univ, Dept Design, INUSE Users & Innovat Res Grp, Espoo, Finland",University of Limerick; Aalto University,"Bakirlioglu, Y (corresponding author), Univ Limerick, Sch Design, Design Factors Res Grp, Limerick, Ireland.",yekta.bakirlioglu@ul.ie; cindy.kohtala@aalto.fi,"Kohtala, Cindy/T-9191-2019; Bakırlıoğlu, Yekta/AAW-4216-2020","Bakırlıoğlu, Yekta/0000-0001-6949-0683; Kohtala, Cindy/0000-0002-7417-0745",Academy of Finland [289520]; KAUTE Foundation; Academy of Finland(Kulttuurin ja Yhteiskunnan Tutkimuksen Toimikunta) [289520]; KAUTE-Saatio; Academy of Finland (AKA) [289520] Funding Source: Academy of Finland (AKA),Academy of Finland(Research Council of Finland); KAUTE Foundation; Academy of Finland(Kulttuurin ja Yhteiskunnan Tutkimuksen Toimikunta); KAUTE-Saatio; Academy of Finland (AKA)(Research Council of Finland),This study was supported in part by the Academy of Finland (Grant 289520 'Getting collaborative design done') and the KAUTE Foundation.; This work was supported by the Academy of Finland(Kulttuurin ja Yhteiskunnan Tutkimuksen Toimikunta) [Grant 289520 'Getting collaborative design done']; and KAUTE-Saatio.,,127,13,14,2,24,TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,PHILADELPHIA,"530 WALNUT STREET, STE 850, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",0737-0024,1532-7051,,HUM-COMPUT INTERACT,Hum.-Comput.

In these narratives, citizen participation in design and intellectual property management based on open source principles are the promise of more sustainable production models. In this context, openness in product design and development has been the object of growing interest and experimentation from academia, businesses and grassroots communities. As a result, numerous concepts emerged that attempt to grasp the essence of this phenomenon, unfortunately leading to overlapping, conflicting or speculative depictions. In this article, we share the understanding we gained throughout 6 years of research on Open Design and Open Source Hardware and attempt to make the difference between myths and facts. We depict an enthusiastic but realistic picture of Open Design and Open Source Hardware practices as we could observe them and deliver a structured framework to situate concepts and their differences.

Product customisation emphasises the fulfilment of explicit requirements of a defined market segment, but product individualisation targets at satisfying the particular needs of a customer. Mass Individualisation (MI) is a new product design approach comprising of an open hardware platform and multiple modules to be integrated with the platform. It gives freedom to end-users to integrate different modules into the platform as per their choice. Technological and strategic integration of all actors involved in the design process is the primary focus of this research. This paper identifies key areas which need to be focussed on to realise this approach and convert it into an industrial practice by an explorative study of existing product design and customisation approaches. An industrial survey was conducted, and results for the industrial implication and insights on this approach are presented. The findings show that the end product from product design for MI will be more creative and innovative by the networking of all actors, and offers more individualised and technologically advanced products.","[Sikhwal, Ravi K.; Childs, Peter R.

His aim is neither environmental protection nor the prevention of unforeseen side-effects of technology development, but the comprehensibility of technologies' operating principles for the user. For if the construction or repairing of tools requires expert knowledge inaccessible to the public, this necessarily entails social imbalances in power. In a similar manner, Bernard Stiegler conceives the delegation of know-how to technological systems as a kind of proletarianization that ultimately may result in a loss of savoir-vivre. Without sweepingly rejecting the division of labour, automation or specialized knowledge, practices of commoning respond to such diagnoses: free software like GNU/Linux or open hardware largely succeed in unlinking the expert knowledge that advanced computing doubtlessly requires from problematic power effects. From this perspective, proprietary algorithms are problematic, as their lack of transparency prevents conviviality. This also holds for the practices of data aggregation and extraction which steadily increase the information gap between platform providers and users. An even more fundamental problem is posed by so-called ""self-learning"", i.e., recursively adapting, algorithms: it is not clear how and to what extent the knowledge and instructions generated by ""artificial intelligence"" can be traced and reconstructed by human insight. Thus, we are confronted with a situation of potentially non-recoverable proletarianization and non-conviviality that exposes a renewed urgency of Illich's considerations concerning technological self-limitation.","[Beinsteiner, Andreas] Univ Wien, Vienna, Austria",University of Vienna,"Beinsteiner, A (corresponding author), Univ Wien, Vienna, Austria.",andreas.beinsteiner@univie.ac.at,,,,,,,17,3,3,1,4,DE GRUYTER POLAND SP Z O O,WARSAW,"BOGUMILA ZUGA 32A STR, 01-811 WARSAW, MAZOVIA, POLAND",2451-3474,,,OPEN CULT STUD,Open Cult.

One of these barriers is concerning the accessibility and affordability of assistive technologies (ATs) that help to enhance the quality of life of these persons. In this context, this systematic literature review (SLR) analyzes and describes how free and open-source hardware (OSHW) and open software (OSS) are employed in the design, development, and deployment of low-cost ATs. In the SLR process, different ATs were analyzed for disabilities such as visual, mobility, upper body, prostheses, hearing & speaking, daily living, and participation in society. The ATs were designed with diverse OSHW and OSS technologies such as Arduino, Raspberry Pi, NVidia Jeston, OpenCV, YOLO, MobileNet, EEG and EMG signal conditioning devices, actuators, and sensors such as ultrasonic, LiDar, or flex. 809 studies were collected and analyzed from the database Web of Science, GitHub, and the specialized journals in OSHW HardwareX and the Journal of Open Hardware during the years 2013-2022. In the first part of the SLR, the bibliometric trends and topic clusters regarding the selected studies are described. Secondly, the ATs identified with open source technologies, e.g., sensor-based or computer vision-based, are described along with a complete state-of-art about these based on each disability recognized. Finally, the issues and challenges to this approach are explored including technical factors, documentation, government policies, and the inclusion of disabled people in open source co-creation. The purpose of this study is to inform practitioners, designers, or stakeholders about low-cost (frugal) ATs with OSHW and OSS, and thus promote their development, accessibility, and affordability, contributing to benefit the community of disabled people.","[Ariza, Jonathan Alvarez] Corp Univ Minuto Dios UNIMINUTO, Engn Fac, Dept Technol Elect, Bogota 111021, Colombia; [Pearce, Joshua M.

These include expansions from software into general culture through 'Free Culture' movements and, more recently, expansions from software into hardware and design. This article provides a critical perspective on the democratic potential of these broader 'open' contribution structures by examining how open source contributions to both software and hardware increase the opportunities for democratic participation in production, governance and knowledge exchange. By analysing attempts to 'open source' the sharing of hardware designs, it also notes the limitations of this democratization. The insights developed in the article nuance the relationship between open source cultures and commercial and market structures, identifying how the generative opportunities created by certain aspects of open source contribution structures increase the potential for democratizing production of communication tools, but also how incongruities across different open-source cultures and communities of practice limit the democratic potential of these processes.","LSE, London WC2A 2AE, England",University of London; London School Economics & Political Science,"Powell, A (corresponding author), LSE, Houghton St, London WC2A 2AE, England.",a.powell@lse.ac.uk,,,,,,,50,77,87,0,29,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0163-4437,1460-3675,,MEDIA CULT SOC,Media Cult.

Among all pollutants, fine particulate matters (PM2.5) directly related to various serious health concerns, e.g., lung cancer, premature death, asthma, and cardiovascular and respiratory diseases. To enhance the quality of urban living, sensors are deployed to create smart cities. In this paper, we present a participatory urban sensing framework for PM2.5 monitoring with more than 2500 devices deployed in Taiwan and 29 other countries. It is one of the largest deployment project for PM2.5 monitor in the world as we know until May 2017. The key feature of the framework is its open system architecture, which is based on the principles of open hardware, open source software, and open data. To facilitate the deployment of the framework, we investigate the accuracy issue of low-cost particle sensors with a comprehensive set of comparison evaluations to identify the most reliable sensor. By working closely with government authorities, industry partners, and maker communities, we can construct an effective eco-system for participatory urban sensing of PM2.5 particles. Based on our deployment achievements to date, we provide a number of data services to improve environmental awareness, trigger on-demand responses, and assist future government policymaking. The proposed framework is highly scalable and sustainable with the potential to facilitate the Internet of Things, smart cities, and citizen science in the future.","[Chen, Ling-Jyh; Lee, Hu-Cheng; Liu, Hao-Min; Hsieh, Hsin-Hung; Huang, Yu-Te] Acad Sinica, Inst Informat Sci, Taipei, Taiwan; [Ho, Yao-Hua; Wu, Hsuan-Cho] Natl Taiwan Normal Univ, Dept Comp Sci & Informat Engn, Taipei, Taiwan; [Lung, Shih-Chun Candice] Acad Sinica, Res Ctr Environm Changes, Taipei, Taiwan",Academia Sinica - Taiwan; National Taiwan Normal University; Academia Sinica - Taiwan,"Chen, LJ (corresponding author), Acad Sinica, Inst Informat Sci, Taipei, Taiwan.",cclljj@iis.sinica.edu.tw,"Lung, Shih-Chun Candice/ABA-1011-2020; Lung, Shih-Chun Candice/GYD-5623-2022; Ho, Yao-Hua/AIA-3819-2022; Chen, Ling-Jyh/A-6311-2009","Lung, Shih-Chun Candice/0000-0002-4227-0469; Lung, Shih-Chun Candice/0000-0002-4227-0469; Ho, Yao-Hua/0000-0002-7993-525X; Chen, Ling-Jyh/0000-0001-5667-7764","Academia Sinica [MOST 105-2221-E-001-016-MY3, MOST 105-3011-F-001-002, MOST 106-3114-E-001-004, AS-104-SS-A02]; Ministry of Science and Technology of Taiwan","Academia Sinica(Academia Sinica - Taiwan); Ministry of Science and Technology of Taiwan(Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan)","This work was supported in part by the Ministry of Science and Technology of Taiwan and in part by Academia Sinica under Grant MOST 105-2221-E-001-016-MY3, Grant MOST 105-3011-F-001-002, Grant MOST 106-3114-E-001-004, and Grant AS-104-SS-A02.",,31,125,132,1,51,IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC,PISCATAWAY,"445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA",2169-3536,,,IEEE ACCESS,IEEE Access,,2017,5,,,,,,14441,14454,,10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2723919,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2723919,,,14,"Computer Science, Information Systems; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Telecommunications",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Computer Science; Engineering; Telecommunications,FI2GW,,gold,,,8/15/24,WOS:000411757800063,not sure ,0,2258,,1,

In these regions, alternative detection technologies such as low-cost monitoring systems can be used instead. Unfortunately, the results of such monitoring devices are often questioned by academics. This contribution proposes the design of an air quality monitoring system where cost and reliability have been optimized from a hardware point of view.

A cornerstone for Open Design is to broaden participation in technology innovation by allowing people to use and contribute to publicly shared resources. Makerspaces are important access points to share and contribute to these resources. However, prior to entering the physical door of a makerspace, makerspaces' social media presence serve as the 'front door' for Open Design activities. In this paper, we examine different 'front doors' of Open Design, asking: What are the characteristics that produce makerspaces' social media presences, and how do these representations shape potential access to Open Design activities? We manually collected and qualitatively analyzed 500 public posts on the Facebook sites of five makerspaces in Copenhagen, Denmark. By choosing the same geographical area, we were able to explore the characteristics of makerspaces' social media presences for the same potential population of Open Design participants. Our analysis identifies three main characteristics of makerspaces' social media presence, which together shape access to Open Design activities, namely reach, transparency, and discourse. The display of these characteristics produce openness and availability in unique ways, and is constitutive for how Open Design activities are produced online.

Rapid growth in the Internet-Of-Things (IoT) and the maker movement is paving the way for low-cost electronic sensors to transform global environmental monitoring. Accessible and inexpensive sensor construction is also fostering exciting opportunities for citizen science and participatory research. Drawing on 6 years of developmental work with Arduino-based open-source hardware and software, extensive laboratory and field testing, and incorporation of such technology into active research programmes, we outline a series of successes, failures and lessons learned in designing and deploying environmental sensors. Six case studies are presented: a water table depth probe, air and water quality sensors, multi-parameter weather stations, a time-sequencing lake sediment trap, and a sonic anemometer for monitoring sand transport. Schematics, code and purchasing guidance to reproduce our sensors are described in the paper, with detailed build instructions hosted on our King's College London Geography Environmental Sensors Github repository and the FreeStation project website. We show in each case study that manual design and construction can produce research-grade scientific instrumentation (mean bias error for calibrated sensors -0.04 to 23%) for a fraction of the conventional cost, provided rigorous, sensor-specific calibration and field testing is conducted. In sharing our collective experiences with build-it-yourself environmental monitoring, we intend for this paper to act as a catalyst for physical geographers and the wider environmental science community to begin incorporating low-cost sensor development into their research activities. The capacity to deploy denser sensor networks should ultimately lead to superior environmental monitoring at the local to global scales.","[Chan, Kristofer; Schillereff, Daniel N.; Baas, Andreas C.

In addition to addressing industry requirements in both contents and methodology, the course develops capabilities and competencies in problem solving, independent learning, teamwork, and technical knowledge. Since PBL methodology alone does not ensure teamwork, it was complemented with CL. Design review meetings (as described in IEC 61160), deliverables, and organizational resources were also introduced to mirror industry demands. This structure integrated course content and student academic achievement in a simulated industrial environment. The course had students build a modular management system for home appliances, implementing control software on the ""Arduino"" open-source platform, as well as using wireless communications. The results show that teaching, learning, and student assessment processes can be improved by using PBL with CL.

Initially designed to appeal to electronic hobbyists, open electronics have formed a global ""maker"" community and are increasingly used in science and industry. In this perspective article, we review the current costs and benefits of open electronics for use in scientific research ranging from the experimental to the theoretical sciences. We discuss how user-made electronic applications can help (I) individual researchers, by increasing the customization, efficiency, and scalability of experiments, while improving data quantity and quality; (II) scientific institutions, by improving access to customizable high-end technologies, sustainability, visibility, and interdisciplinary collaboration potential; and (III) the scientific community, by improving transparency and reproducibility, helping decouple research capacity from funding, increasing innovation, and improving collaboration potential among researchers and the public. We further discuss how current barriers like poor awareness, knowledge access, and time investments can be resolved by increased documentation and collaboration, and provide guidelines for academics to enter this emerging field. We highlight that open electronics are a promising and powerful tool to help scientific research to become more innovative and reproducible and offer a key practical solution to improve democratic access to science.","[Oellermann, Michael] Tech Univ Munich, TUM Sch Life Sci, Aquat Syst Biol Unit, Muhlenweg 22, D-85354 Freising Weihenstephan, Germany; [Oellermann, Michael] Univ Tasmania, Fisheries & Aquaculture Ctr, Inst Marine & Antarctic Studies, Private Bag 49, Hobart, Tas 7001, Australia; [Jolles, Jolle W.] Ctr Res Ecol & Forestry Applicat CREAF, Campus UAB,Edifici C, Barcelona 08193, Spain; [Ortiz, Diego] Inst Nacl Tecnol Agr INTA, Estn Expt Manfredi, Ruta 9,Km 636, RA-5988 Cordoba, Argentina; [Seabra, Rui] Univ Porto, Ctr Invest Biodiversidade & Recursos Genet, CIBIO, InBIO Lab Associado, Campus Vairao, P-4485661 Vairao, Portugal; [Seabra, Rui] CIBIO, BIOPOLIS Program Genom Biodivers & Land Planning, Campus Vairao, P-4485661 Vairao, Portugal; [Wenzel, Tobias] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Sch Engn, Inst Biol & Med Engn, Vicuna Mackenna 4860,G92Q 26, Santiago 7820244, Chile; [Wenzel, Tobias] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Sch Med & Biol Sci, Inst Biol & Med Engn, Vicuna Mackenna 4860,G92Q 26, Santiago 7820244, Chile; [Wilson, Hannah] Utah State Univ, Coll Sci, Biol Dept, 5305 Old Main Hill, Logan, UT 84321 USA; [Tanner, Richelle L.] Chapman Univ, Environm Sci & Policy Program, 1 Univ Dr, Orange, CA 92866 USA",Technical University of Munich; University of Tasmania; Centro de Investigacion Ecologica y Aplicaciones Forestales (CREAF-CERCA); Autonomous University of Barcelona; Instituto Nacional de Tecnologia Agropecuaria (INTA); Universidade do Porto; Universidade do Porto; Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Chile; Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Chile; Utah System of Higher Education; Utah State University; Chapman University System; Chapman University,"Oellermann, M (corresponding author), Tech Univ Munich, TUM Sch Life Sci, Aquat Syst Biol Unit, Muhlenweg 22, D-85354 Freising Weihenstephan, Germany.; Oellermann, M (corresponding author), Univ Tasmania, Fisheries & Aquaculture Ctr, Inst Marine & Antarctic Studies, Private Bag 49, Hobart, Tas 7001, Australia.",michael.oellermann@utas.edu.au,"Wenzel, Tobias/AAN-2827-2020; Wenzel, Tobias/A-2319-2015; Jolles, Jolle Wolter/E-9842-2011; Seabra, Rui/J-7814-2012; Oellermann, Michael/G-7073-2011","Wenzel, Tobias/0000-0001-8443-1315; Jolles, Jolle Wolter/0000-0001-9905-2633; Seabra, Rui/0000-0002-0240-3992; Oellermann, Michael/0000-0001-5392-6737; Ortiz, Diego/0000-0001-8584-8921","German Research Foundation fellowship [OE 658/2]; California Sea Grant Delta Science Postdoctoral Fellowship [SWC 20-42, R/SF-107]; EMBL; Fellowship Freies Wissen by Wikimedia DE and co; ANID/FONDECYT/INICIACION [11200666]; FEDER through POR Norte [NORTE01-0145-FEDER-031053]; FCT [PTDC/BIA-BMA/31053/2017, CEECIND/01424/2017]; INTA [2019-PE-E6-I128-001, 2019-PE-E6I114-001, REC I117]",German Research Foundation fellowship(German Research Foundation (DFG)); California Sea Grant Delta Science Postdoctoral Fellowship; EMBL; Fellowship Freies Wissen by Wikimedia DE and co; ANID/FONDECYT/INICIACION; FEDER through POR Norte; FCT(Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia (FCT)); INTA,"M.O. was supported by a German Research Foundation fellowship OE 658/2.

As a case study using open-source hardware and software for the mining industry, this study proposed a low-cost environmental monitoring system for non-metallic underground mines to support mine safety and occupational health issues. The system was developed using open-source hardware, Arduino and 3D printer, to design the monitoring device. An open-source software, MIT App Inventor, was used for developing an Android application for smartphones to enable remote communication with the system. Field experiments were conducted at an underground tunnel and a non-metallic underground mining site to assess the performance of the system in both mobile and static modes, respectively. Although a few limitations related to the precision of the low-cost dust and gas sensors still exist, the findings of the experiments show that the mining industry can benefit from open-source technology deployment when considering cost factors.","[Mardonova, Mokhinabonu; Choi, Yosoon] Pukyong Natl Univ, Dept Energy Resources Engn, Busan 48513, South Korea",Pukyong National University,"Choi, Y (corresponding author), Pukyong Natl Univ, Dept Energy Resources Engn, Busan 48513, South Korea.",energy@pknu.ac.kr,"Mardonova, Mokhinabonu/HNC-1152-2023","Mardonova, Mokhinabonu/0000-0001-6466-2909; Choi, Yosoon/0000-0001-9616-3725",Basic Science Research Program through the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) - Ministry of Education [2018R1D1A1A09083947],Basic Science Research Program through the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) - Ministry of Education,This work was supported by Basic Science Research Program through the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) funded by the Ministry of Education (2018R1D1A1A09083947).,,84,11,11,2,13,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",2524-3462,2524-3470,,MINING METALL EXPLOR,Mining Metall.

Having access to education and the means of production appears as the major factors for the implementation of this goal. 3D printing is a revolutionary technology that has the potential to bring digital manufacturing to everyone. However, the rise of personal fabrication requires an increase in printing quality, a reduction on machine cost and an increase in knowledge shared by the open hardware community. The purpose of this paper is to explore the development of a new Open Hardware printer project to address these points. Design/methodology/approach - The authors have designed and constructed a low-cost photopolymer-based 3D printer called BeamMaker. The printer is connected to a host computer and a digital-light-processing projector. This work details the design process and how improvements were implemented to reach good printing quality. The authors provide public access to the instructions, software, source code, parts list, user manual and STL and CAD files. Findings - The BeamMaker printer can build objects with a high surface quality that is comparable to the quality obtained by industrial photopolymer-based 3D printers. When testing the ability to print a sample cylinder, the printer shows higher accuracy when compared to other personal 3D printers. These findings are encouraging considering the low cost of the system. Research limitations/implications - The printing failure rate of the system has not been measured to date. The system requires some improvements to produce large objects. Practical implications - The printer cost is just USD380. This is five to eight times less expensive than popular personal 3D printers available today. The cost is 30 times less expensive than a personal photopolymer 3D printer produced by a main commercial company and yet producing results of similar quality. The authors expect good avenues for collaboration from the open-source community to continue improving these systems. Social implications - The high cost of current personal 3D printers prevents users from developing countries from entering into the open hardware trend. A dramatic reduction in printer cost such as that explored in this work might contribute to the real democratization of personal fabrication. Originality/value - The authors report on the status of three other photopolymer-based personal 3D printer projects. To the best of the authors' knowledge, BeamMaker is the first fully open hardware 3D printer project which uses this technology.","[Calderon, Ariel; Griffin, James; Cristobal Zagal, Juan] Univ Chile, Dept Mech Engn, Santiago, Chile",Universidad de Chile,"Zagal, JC (corresponding author), Univ Chile, Dept Mech Engn, Santiago, Chile.",jczagal@ing.uchile.cl,"Zagal, Juan Cristobal/F-5036-2016; Calderón, Ariel Alejandro/AAA-9472-2020; Griffin, Jillian M/F-9415-2010; Griffin, James/H-9512-2013","Calderón, Ariel Alejandro/0000-0002-7854-6543; Griffin, James/0000-0002-9179-5130",Fondecyt Chile [11110353],Fondecyt Chile(Comision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT)CONICYT FONDECYT),The authors acknowledge funding provided from Fondecyt Chile project number 11110353.,,17,13,13,1,27,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1355-2546,1758-7670,,RAPID PROTOTYPING J,Rapid Prototyping J.,,2014,20,3,,,,,245,255,,10.1108/RPJ-01-2013-0006,http://dx.doi.org/10.1108/RPJ-01-2013-0006,,,11,"Engineering, Mechanical; Materials Science, Multidisciplinary",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Engineering; Materials Science,AN9SY,,,,,8/15/24,WOS:000340950200009,H ,0,2269,,1,

Four IoT companies adopting open-source hardware principles were selected as case studies. The data collection was based on 18 interviews highlighting both the perspectives of the companies and their corresponding communities and the opinions of key experts in the domain. In our findings, we illustrate the different manifestations of open business models and the companies' concrete approaches to working with external stakeholders.

Local collaboration with hospitals and healthcare professionals were established. These bottom-up initiatives from maker networks across the globe are showing us how responsible innovation is happening outside the constraints of profit-driven large industries. In this qualitative study we present five cases from a global network of makers that contributed to the production of personal protective equipment (PPE) and healthcare-related products. We draw our cases from the experiences made in Careables, a mixed community of people and organizations committed to the co-design and making of open, personalized healthcare for everyone. With the presented cases we reflect on the potential implications for post-pandemic local production of healthcare products and analyze them from a social innovation perspective.

Obtaining real-time non-invasive information to monitor crops or make yield predictions is a challenge. An approach is to use crop yield models in combination with real-time data used as input in such models. It was demonstrated that it is possible to design an accurate system using open source hardware and open systems to record the input for these models and monitor crops. The system presented has two main components: a device that records environmental parameters and a smartphone application (software) that links this device to a data server in order to process and analyse the information. The solution is scalable in terms of the type of sensors used (i.e. temperature and relative humidity of the air or soil), the rate of information retrieval and so on, so it can be used in various scenarios, including environmental or land policy monitoring. Moreover, this open source hardware can be used by a broad variety of users and is an alternative in poor rural areas because of its low cost compared to other solutions. It can enable increased agricultural production and management of the local environment, bringing new agricultural practices to these areas. Furthermore, progress in the use of this type of technology can help to develop new capabilities for growers. Results of calibration tests and measurements to demonstrate the usefulness of this system in precision agriculture are presented. (C) 2015 IAgrE. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

The information obtained from the sensors is collected and stored in a flash memory card, and simultaneously is sent via WiFi to the cloud. This data is stored in an online spreadsheet, which permits us to access the information in real time. On the other hand, a comparative analysis of the results obtained from sensors has been carried out, thanks to which several guidance guidelines have been developed for the selection of the most appropriate environmental sensor for each project. Finally, an additional evaluation of the device has been carried out through the analysis of its energy performance and providing information related to the data storage and its cost of development. The current research shows a clear ability to develop monitoring systems for the building sector, which can also be extended to multiple applications of Smart Environments.

The current approach to application development, known as monolithic architecture, is not suitable for the newest appliances. Recently, the microservice-based application architecture has emerged as a potential solution that could meet the imposed challenges. In order to educate new generations of software and IT engineers to be able to develop such microservice-based applications, educators at universities should establish an efficient platform to ensure this process. This article presents the portable and lightweight platform for teaching application development based on microservices.

Information and Communications Technology are called on to be one of the key players to get these cities to use smart devices and sensors (Internet of Things) to know at every moment what is happening within the city, in order to make decisions that will improve the management of resources. The proliferation of these ""smart things"" is producing significant deployment of networks in the city context. Most of these devices are proprietary solutions, which do not offer free access to the data they provide. Therefore, this prevents the interoperability and compatibility of these solutions in the current smart city developments. This paper presents how to embed an open sensorized platform for both hardware and software in the context of a smart city, more specifically in a university campus. For this integration, GlScience comes into play, where it offers different open standards that allow full control over ""smart things"" as an agile and interoperable way to achieve this. To test our system, we have deployed a network of different sensorized platforms inside the university campus, in order to monitor environmental phenomena. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

A modular, platform-based, approach is the way to obtain this result. Modular approaches are common for software development, but hardware is still crafted often re-inventing solutions every time. As a consequence, the resources that should be invested in the development of a new robot get often drained by the implementation of a physical, working prototype to test the application idea. To overcome this problem, we propose R2P (Rapid Robot Prototyping), a framework to implement real-time, high-quality architectures for robotic systems with off-the-shelf basic modules (e.g., sensors, actuators, and controllers), integrating hardware and software, which can be assembled in a plug-and-play way. R2P provides hardware modules, a protocol for real-time communication, a middleware to connect components as well as tools to support the development of software on the modules. R2P aims at dramatically reduce time and efforts required to build a prototype robot, making it possible to focus the resources on the development of new robotic applications instead of struggling on their implementation. This enables also people with experience in a specific application domain, but with little technical background, to actively participate in the development of new robotic applications. R2P is open-source both in its software and hardware to promote its diffusion among the robotics community and novel business models that will substantially reduce the costs to design a new robotic product.

Its main goal is to provide a low-cost solution capable of supporting proof-of-concept implementations and rapid prototyping methodologies for both consumer and industrial IoT markets. AGILE allows developers to implement and deliver a complete (software and hardware) IoT solution for managing non-IP IoT devices through a multi-service gateway. Moreover, it simplifies the access of startups to the IoT market, not only providing an efficient and cost-effective solution for industries but also allowing end-users to customize and extend it according to their specific requirements. This flexibility is the result of the joint experience of established organizations in the project consortium already promoting the principles of openness, both at the software and hardware levels.

The objective of this study is to investigate the potential of open-source (OS) technologies in an educational setting, given the combination of economic constraints affecting all educational environments and the ability of OS design to profoundly decrease the cost of technological tools and technological innovation. Methods: This paper reports on a 3-day workshop augmented with online instructional and visual tools designed for middle school and high school level educators from a wide array of disciplines (including traditional science, math, and engineering as well as computer, shop, and art). Teachers (n=22) submitted applications to participate in the workshop, the workshop was observed for both evaluation and research, teachers participated in focus groups (n=2) during the workshop in order to discuss their interest in OS 3-D printing technology and its potential role in their classrooms, and teachers completed a voluntary post-workshop survey and responded to follow-up after printers were in the classroom for one year. Results: During the workshop teachers built 3-D printers using OS technologies that they were then able to take back to their schools and into their classrooms. Conclusion: Through workshops augmented with online instructional and visual tools designed to provide facilitated yet self-directed engagement with a new, relatively unknown, and relatively complex technology, paired teacher teams were able to successfully build and use RepRap 3-D printers based on OS design in just three days. Practice: Here, we discuss both what the teachers learned and what we learned from the teachers regarding the potential for educators to construct OS 3-D printing technologies as a tool of empowering and transformative education. Implications: Open-source 3-D printing technologies have the potential to improve education through a sense of empowerment resulting from active participation, as well as through cross-curriculum engagement.

However, the focused skill sets of researchers who aim to facilitate their own research limit FOSH complexity. The most expensive research equipment normally requires an interdisciplinary team. To overcome this complexity barrier and obtain large returns on investment for research funders by replacing the most expensive proprietary research equipment with FOSH, new development funding mechanisms are needed. To guide such research policy, this paper provides the first analysis of the strategic national benefit of applying the FOSH approach to major research equipment for any nation. The results of an example analysis for a single nation indicate Finland's science funders could save between 2.84-27.7m(sic)/year directly on scientific equipment purchases if research hardware is converted to FOSH and the nation would likely garner the well-established concomitant benefits of increased research innovation within their economy. Finally, a detailed generalized model for determining national research policy in hardware development is derived and research policy mechanisms for accelerating FOSH deployment and greater accessibility to research equipment are discussed.","[Heikkinen, I.

Unlike centralized manufacturing, distributed manufacturing makes the parts and products (the prints) at (or closer to) the source of the demand, cutting out much of the traditional supply chain. Although many expect 3-D printing to take off at the household level and previous work has shown significant returns for those choosing to do so, there are still significant barriers to entry for typical consumers. Our analysis demonstrates that for an individual to make an abnormally high return on their investments in 3-D printers, they must serve others to achieve high utilization rates. The impetus to do so is created by a service that can undercut traditionally manufactured products due to affordability and customizability. Low-cost, open-source 3-D printers are now priced within range of individual entrepreneurs who can take advantage of the long tail of consumers with highly varied interests.

First, the use of parametric open-source designs using an open-source computer aided design package is described to customize the optics hardware for any application. Second, details are provided on the use of open-source 3 D printers (additive layer manufacturing) to fabricate the primary mechanical components, which are then combined to construct complex optics-related devices. Third, the use of the open-source electronics prototyping platform are illustrated as control for optical experimental apparatuses. This study demonstrates an open-source optical library, which significantly reduces the costs associated with much optical equipment, while also enabling relatively easily adapted customizable designs. The cost reductions in general are over 97%, with some components representing only 1% of the current commercial investment for optical products of similar function.

These self-replicating rapid prototypers (RepRaps) can manufacture approximately half of their own parts from sequential fused deposition of polymer feedstocks. RepRaps have been demonstrated for conventional prototyping and engineering, customizing scientific equipment, and appropriate technology-related manufacturing for sustainable development. However, in order for this technology to proliferate like 2-D electronic printers have, it must be economically viable for a typical household. This study reports on the life-cycle economic analysis (LCEA) of RepRap technology for an average US household. A new low-cost RepRap is described and the costs of materials and time to construct it are quantified. The economic costs of a selection of 20 open-source printable designs (representing less than 0.02% of those available), are typical of products that a household might purchase, are quantified for print time, energy, and filament consumption and compared to low and high Internet market prices for similar products without shipping costs. The results show that even making the extremely conservative assumption that the household would only use the printer to make the selected 20 products a year the avoided purchase cost savings would range from about $300 to $2000/year. Assuming the 25 h of necessary printing for the selected products is evenly distributed throughout the year these savings provide a simple payback time for the RepRap in 4 months to 2 years and provide an ROI between >200% and >40%. As both upgrades and the components that are most likely to wear out in the RepRap can be printed and thus the lifetime of the distributing manufacturing can be substantially increased the unavoidable conclusion from this study is that the RepRap is an economically attractive investment for the average US household already. It appears clear that as RepRaps improve in reliability, continue to decline in cost and both the number and assumed utility of open-source designs continues growing exponentially, open-source 3-D printers will become a mass-market mechatronic device.

Open systems have a reputation for being difficult to acquire, poorly documented, and hard to maintain. With the arrival of more powerful and compact integrated circuits, rapid prototyping services, and web-based tools for collaborative development, these stereotypes must be reconsidered. We discuss some of the reasons why multichannel extracellular electrophysiology could benefit from open-source approaches and describe examples of successful community-driven tool development within this field. In order to promote the adoption of open-source hardware and to reduce the need for redundant development efforts, we advocate a move toward standardized interfaces that connect each element of the data processing pipeline. This will give researchers the flexibility to modify their tools when necessary, while allowing them to continue to benefit from the high-quality products and expertise provided by commercial vendors.","[Siegle, Joshua H.; Hale, Gregory J.; Newman, Jonathan P.; Voigts, Jakob] MIT, Dept Brain & Cognit Sci, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA",Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT),"Siegle, JH (corresponding author), Allen Inst Brain Sci, Seattle, WA 98103 USA.",joshs@alleninstitute.org,"Newman, Jonathan/AAI-5411-2021","Newman, Jonathan/0000-0002-5425-3340","Center for Brains, Minds and Machines (CBMM) - USA National Science Foundation STC award [CCF-1231216]; NIH National Research Service Award [5F31MH98508-2]","Center for Brains, Minds and Machines (CBMM) - USA National Science Foundation STC award; NIH National Research Service Award(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA)","We would like to thank Matt Wilson, Chris Moore, and Steve Potter for supporting the open-source development efforts described in this manuscript.

However, the aggregate environmental benefits of distributed manufacturing are not clear due to scale reductions and the potential for increases in embodied energy. To quantify the environmental impact of distributed manufacturing using 3D printers, a life cycle analysis was performed on three plastic products. The embodied energy and emissions from conventional large-scale production in low-labor cost countries and shipping are compared to experimental measurements on a RepRap with and without solar photovoltaic (PV) power fabricating products with acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS) and polylactic acid (PLA). The results indicate that the cumulative energy demand of manufacturing polymer products can be reduced by 41-64% (55-74% with PV) and concomitant emission reductions using distributed manufacturing with existing low-cost open-source 3D printers when using <25% fill PIA. Less pronounced positive environmental results are observed with ABS, which demands higher temperatures for the print bed and extruder. Overall, the results indicate that distributed manufacturing using open-source 3D printers has the potential to have a lower environmental impact than conventional manufacturing for a variety of products.","[Kreiger, Megan; Pearce, Joshua M.] Michigan Technol Univ, Dept Mat Sci & Engn, Houghton, MI 49931 USA; [Pearce, Joshua M.] Michigan Technol Univ, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, Houghton, MI 49931 USA",Michigan Technological University; Michigan Technological University,"Pearce, JM (corresponding author), 601 M&M Bldg,1400 Townsend Dr, Houghton, MI 49931 USA.",pearce@mtu.edu,"Pearce, Joshua/D-2052-2010","Pearce, Joshua/0000-0001-9802-3056; Kreiger, Megan/0000-0002-9721-9513",Sustainable Futures Institute,Sustainable Futures Institute,"The authors would like to acknowledge helpful discussions with D.

This article reviews the opportunity to use FOSH as a sanction to undercut imports and exports from a target criminal country. A formal methodology is presented for selecting strategic national investments in FOSH development to improve both national security and global safety. In this methodology, first the target country that is threatening national security or safety is identified. Next, the top imports from the target country as well as potentially other importing countries (allies) are quantified. Hardware is identified that could undercut imports/exports from the target country. Finally, methods to support the FOSH development are enumerated to support production in a commons-based peer production strategy. To demonstrate how this theoretical method works in practice, it is applied as a case study to a current criminal military aggressor nation, who is also a fossil-fuel exporter. The results show that there are numerous existing FOSH and opportunities to develop new FOSH for energy conservation and renewable energy to reduce fossil-fuel-energy demand. Widespread deployment would reduce the concomitant pollution, human health impacts, and environmental desecration as well as cut financing of military operations.","[Pearce, Joshua M.] Western Univ, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, London, ON N6A 5B9, Canada; [Pearce, Joshua M.] Western Univ, Ivey Business Sch, London, ON N6G 0N1, Canada",Western University (University of Western Ontario); Western University (University of Western Ontario),"Pearce, JM (corresponding author), Western Univ, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, London, ON N6A 5B9, Canada.; Pearce, JM (corresponding author), Western Univ, Ivey Business Sch, London, ON N6G 0N1, Canada.",joshua.pearce@uwo.ca,"Pearce, Joshua/C-9240-2013","Pearce, Joshua/0000-0001-9802-3056",Thompson Endowment,Thompson Endowment,This research was supported by the Thompson Endowment.,,194,6,6,1,4,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2227-7080,,TECHNOLOGIES,Technologies,APR,2022,10,2,,,,,,,53,10.3390/technologies10020053,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/technologies10020053,,,18,"Engineering, Multidisciplinary",Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI),Engineering,0Q7BQ,,"Green Submitted, gold",,,8/15/24,WOS:000785069700001,,0,2297,R?,1,

Therefore, the need for a suitable open source system that can be used as a prototype platform to test new network functionality while ensuring line-rate processing, accurate timestamping, and reduced power consumption has become evident. All these requirements cannot be achieved by using software-only solutions, but rather with hardware-based platforms such as NetFPGA. The main obstacle when using this type of open source FPGA-based solution is the cost of development, in both time and hardware development skills required. The spread of new circuit synthesis tools using high-level languages opens the door for the development of hardware-based networking applications with reasonable development effort, compared to the use of traditional hardware description languages. In this article, we describe how existing open source hardware-based platforms for networking applications will be fueled by the change in the programming model of FPGAs provided by modern high-level synthesis tools. For this, we implemented a network flow monitor using high-level languages and compared the effort spent with respect to a traditional hardware development cycle. Preliminary results are very promising, given that development time is reduced from months to weeks.","[Forconesi, Marco] Univ Cambridge, Comp Lab, Networks & Operating Syst Grp, Cambridge CB2 1TN, England; [Forconesi, Marco; Sutter, Gustavo; Lopez-Buedo, Sergio; Aracil, Javier] Univ Autonoma Madrid, E-28049 Madrid, Spain; [Lopez de Vergara, Jorge E.] Univ Autonoma Madrid, Elect & Commun Technol Dept, E-28049 Madrid, Spain",University of Cambridge; Autonomous University of Madrid; Autonomous University of Madrid,"Forconesi, M (corresponding author), Univ Cambridge, Comp Lab, Networks & Operating Syst Grp, Cambridge CB2 1TN, England.",marco.forconesi@uam.es; gustavo.sutter@uam.es; sergio.lopez-buedo@uam.es; jorge.lopez_vergara@uam.es; javier.aracil@uam.es,"Aracil, Javier/AAA-8192-2019; López de Vergara, Jorge E./A-1393-2011; Lopez-Buedo, Sergio/L-3250-2013","Aracil, Javier/0000-0001-8030-1062; López de Vergara, Jorge E./0000-0002-4057-4688;",Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness under the project PackTrack [TEC2012-33754],Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness under the project PackTrack,This work has been partially supported by the Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness under the project PackTrack (TEC2012-33754).,,11,14,14,0,8,IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC,PISCATAWAY,"445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA",0890-8044,1558-156X,,IEEE NETWORK,IEEE Netw.,SEP-OCT,2014,28,5,,,,,13,19,,10.1109/MNET.2014.6915434,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/MNET.2014.6915434,,,7,"Computer Science, Hardware & Architecture; Computer Science, Information Systems; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Telecommunications",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Computer Science; Engineering; Telecommunications,AU4KM,,,,,8/15/24,WOS:000345579700004,,0,2299,Not sure - just know its not relevant ,1,

This is due to both the complex and interconnected data required for product design and manufacture, and to the centralised computing infrastructure traditionally used to manage product lifecycle data. While modern cloud-based solutions to collaborative design are gaining popularity, they diminish the control of each design partner. In contrast, software designers readily collaborate on highly complex software, while retaining direct control of the files they are editing due to the dominance of distributed version control. Distributed version control for software is often coupled with 'Developer Operations' or DevOps tools to automate critical processes and facilitate communication. This paper explores how DevOps workflows can be adapted for open development of hardware. An example of how DevOps for hardware (HardOps) can be implemented is provided by the OpenFlexure Microscope project. While much ground remains to be broken in this field, HardOps can support a new paradigm of distributed hardware development, with enormous benefits not only for open-source hardware, but also commercial hardware.","[Stirling, Julian; Bumke, Kaspar; Collins, Joel; Bowman, Richard] Univ Bath, Dept Phys, Bath, Avon, England; [Dhokia, Vimal] Univ Bath, Dept Mech Engn, Bath, Avon, England",University of Bath; University of Bath,"Stirling, J (corresponding author), Univ Bath, Dept Phys, Bath, Avon, England.",j.stirling@bath.ac.uk,"Bowman, Richard W/D-7736-2011","Bowman, Richard W/0000-0002-1531-8199; Dhokia, Vimal/0000-0002-6343-6958; Collins, Joel/0000-0002-9382-7511","Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council [EP/R011443/1, EP/R013969/1]; Royal Society [RGF\EA\181034, URF\R1\180153]; EPSRC [EP/R011443/1] Funding Source: UKRI; GCRF [EP/R013969/1] Funding Source: UKRI",Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)); Royal Society(Royal Society); EPSRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)); GCRF(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)),"This work was supported by the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council [EP/R011443/1,EP/R013969/1]; Royal Society [RGF\EA\181034,URF\R1\180153].",,19,3,3,0,3,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0951-192X,1362-3052,,INT J COMPUT INTEG M,Int.

Open source scientific hardware enables custom experimentation, laboratory control, rapid upgrading, transparent maintenance, and lower costs in general. To aid in this trend, this study describes the development, design, assembly, and operation of a 3-D printable open source desktop nutating mixer, which provides a fixed 20 degrees platform tilt angle for a gentle three-dimensional (gyrating) agitation of chemical or biological samples (e.g., DNA or blood samples) without foam formation. The custom components for the nutating mixer are designed using open source FreeCAD software to enable customization. All of the non-readily available components can be fabricated with a low-cost RepRap 3-D printer using an open source software tool chain from common thermoplastics. All of the designs are open sourced and can be configured to add more functionality to the equipment in the future. It is relatively easy to assemble and is accessible to both the science education of younger students as well as state-of-the-art research laboratories. Overall, the open source nutating mixer can be fabricated with US$37 in parts, which is 1/10th of the cost of proprietary nutating mixers with similar capabilities. The open source nature of the device allow it to be easily repaired or upgraded with digital files, as well as to accommodate custom sample sizes and mixing velocities with minimal additional costs.","[Trivedi, Dhwani K.; Pearce, Joshua M.] Michigan Technol Univ, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, Houghton, MI 49931 USA; [Pearce, Joshua M.] Aalto Univ, Sch Elect Engn, Dept Elect & Nanoengn, Espoo 02150, Finland; [Pearce, Joshua M.] Michigan Technol Univ, Dept Mat Sci & Engn, Houghton, MI 49931 USA",Michigan Technological University; Aalto University; Michigan Technological University,"Pearce, JM (corresponding author), Michigan Technol Univ, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, Houghton, MI 49931 USA.; Pearce, JM (corresponding author), Aalto Univ, Sch Elect Engn, Dept Elect & Nanoengn, Espoo 02150, Finland.; Pearce, JM (corresponding author), Michigan Technol Univ, Dept Mat Sci & Engn, Houghton, MI 49931 USA.",dktrived@mtu.edu; pearce@mtu.edu,"Pearce, Joshua/D-2052-2010","Pearce, Joshua/0000-0001-9802-3056",Michigan Tech Open Sustainability Technology Laboratory; Fulbright Finland,Michigan Tech Open Sustainability Technology Laboratory; Fulbright Finland,This project was supported by the Michigan Tech Open Sustainability Technology Laboratory and Fulbright Finland.

This situation has produced different effects in today's society, among which is the empowerment of citizens, called makers, who are themselves able to generate citizen science or build assembly developments. Situated in the context described above, the current study follows a Do-It-Yourself (DIY) approach. In this way, it attempts to define a conceptual design of an Internet of Things (IoT) node, which is reproducible at both physical and behavioral levels, to build IoT nodes which can cover any scenario. To test this conceptual design, this study proposes a sensorization node to monitor meteorological phenomena. The node is called SEnviro (node) and features different improvements such as: the possibility of remote updates using Over-the-Air (OTA) updates; autonomy, using 3G connectivity, a solar panel, and applied energy strategies to prolong its life; and replicability, because it is made up of open hardware and other elements such as 3D-printed pieces. The node is validated in the field of smart agriculture, with the aim of monitoring different meteorological phenomena, which will be used as input to disease detection models to detect possible diseases within vineyards.","[Trilles, Sergio; Gonzalez-Perez, Alberto; Huerta, Joaquin] Univ Jaume 1, Inst New Imaging Technol, Av Vicente Sos Baynat S-N, Castellon De La Plana 12071, Spain",Universitat Jaume I,"Trilles, S (corresponding author), Univ Jaume 1, Inst New Imaging Technol, Av Vicente Sos Baynat S-N, Castellon De La Plana 12071, Spain.",strilles@uji.es; algonzal@uji.es; huerta@uji.es,"Huerta, Joaquín/L-6103-2018; Trilles, Sergio/AAB-1339-2019; González-Pérez, Alberto/AAA-4352-2020","Trilles, Sergio/0000-0002-9304-0719; González-Pérez, Alberto/0000-0002-9016-9357",postdoctoral programme Vali+d (GVA) [APOSTD/2016/058]; GVA doctoral stays programme [BEST/2018/053]; Universitat Jaume I-PINV 2017 [UJI-A2017-14]; European Commission through the GEO-C project (H2020-MSCA-ITN-2014) [642332],postdoctoral programme Vali+d (GVA); GVA doctoral stays programme; Universitat Jaume I-PINV 2017; European Commission through the GEO-C project (H2020-MSCA-ITN-2014),"Sergio Trilles has been funded by the postdoctoral programme Vali+d (GVA) (grant number APOSTD/2016/058) and GVA doctoral stays programme (grant number BEST/2018/053).

Similarly, the concept of openly shared hardware has gained attention, due to its cost-effectiveness and the prospect of improved reproducibility. A major motivation for the development of organic electronics is its promise to deliver substantial advantages in price and manufacturability relative to its inorganic counterpart. Here, two open-source tools for organic electronics are introduced: a dip-coating device designed for thin film fabrication and a four-point probe for precisely measuring the resistance of thin films. These tools only cost a fraction of comparable commercial devices and run with open-source software to ensure a user-friendly experience. A case study demonstrates the optimization of simple fluorescent organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs) using these open-source tools achieving 4% external quantum efficiency (EQE). To characterize these OLEDs, a previously reported open-source setup for accurate efficiency measurements is used. A substantial software upgrade to this setup, which speeds up the characterization of electroluminescence, is also repor. This work contributes open-source hardware and software to the field of organic electronics, thereby lowering the entrance barrier to the field and fostering the involvement of scientists with diverse scientific backgrounds. The open-source movement has catalyzed progress in many areas of research such as software development, artificial intelligence, and hardware development. This work introduces new cost-effective, open-source hardware projects for the organic electronics community: a dip-coating device for thin film fabrication, a four-point probe for resistance measurement, and improvements to the previously reported setup for efficiency measurements of light-emitting devices. image","[Butscher, Julian F.; Gather, Malte C.] Univ St Andrews, Organ Semicond Ctr, Sch Phys & Astron, SUPA, St Andrews KY16 9SS, Scotland; [Butscher, Julian F.; Kwon, Seonil; Popczyk, Anna; Gather, Malte C.] Univ Cologne, Humboldt Ctr Nano & Biophoton, Dept Chem, D-50939 Cologne, Germany",University of St Andrews; University of Cologne,"Gather, MC (corresponding author), Univ St Andrews, Organ Semicond Ctr, Sch Phys & Astron, SUPA, St Andrews KY16 9SS, Scotland.; Gather, MC (corresponding author), Univ Cologne, Humboldt Ctr Nano & Biophoton, Dept Chem, D-50939 Cologne, Germany.",malte.gather@uni-koeln.de,,,Alexander von Humboldt Foundation (Humboldt Professorship) [RTG2591]; Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council [EP/X039250/1],Alexander von Humboldt Foundation (Humboldt Professorship)(Alexander von Humboldt Foundation); Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)),"J.F.B. acknowledges funding from Beverly and Frank MacInnis via the University of St Andrews.

Here, we summarise community-driven approaches based on Free and Open Source scientific and medical Hardware (FOSH) as well as personal protective equipment (PPE) currently being developed and deployed to support the global response for COVID-19 prevention, patient treatment and diagnostics.","[Chagas, Andre Maia; Baden, Tom] Univ Sussex, Sch Life Sci, Sussex Neurosci, Brighton, E Sussex, England; [Chagas, Andre Maia; Prieto-Godino, Lucia L.; Baden, Tom] TReND Africa, Brighton, E Sussex, England; [Chagas, Andre Maia; Molloy, Jennifer C.] Univ Cambridge, Gathering Open Sci Hardware, Cambridge, England; [Molloy, Jennifer C.] Univ Cambridge, Dept Chem Engn & Biotechnol, Cambridge, England; [Prieto-Godino, Lucia L.] Francis Crick Inst, London, England; [Prieto-Godino, Lucia L.; Baden, Tom] Univ Tubingen, FENS KAVLI Network Excellence, Tubingen, Germany; [Baden, Tom] Univ Tubingen, Inst Ophthalm Res, Tubingen, Germany",University of Sussex; University of Cambridge; University of Cambridge; Francis Crick Institute; Eberhard Karls University of Tubingen; Eberhard Karls University of Tubingen; Eberhard Karls University Hospital,"Chagas, AM; Baden, T (corresponding author), Univ Sussex, Sch Life Sci, Sussex Neurosci, Brighton, E Sussex, England.; Chagas, AM; Prieto-Godino, LL; Baden, T (corresponding author), TReND Africa, Brighton, E Sussex, England.; Chagas, AM; Molloy, JC (corresponding author), Univ Cambridge, Gathering Open Sci Hardware, Cambridge, England.; Molloy, JC (corresponding author), Univ Cambridge, Dept Chem Engn & Biotechnol, Cambridge, England.; Prieto-Godino, LL (corresponding author), Francis Crick Inst, London, England.; Prieto-Godino, LL; Baden, T (corresponding author), Univ Tubingen, FENS KAVLI Network Excellence, Tubingen, Germany.; Baden, T (corresponding author), Univ Tubingen, Inst Ophthalm Res, Tubingen, Germany.",a.maia-chagas@sussex.ac.uk; jcm80@cam.ac.uk; lucia.prietogodino@crick.ac.uk; baden@sussex.ac.uk,"Chagas, Andre/AFR-6550-2022; Baden, Tom/H-1412-2011","Molloy, Jenny/0000-0003-3477-8462; Prieto-Godino, Lucia L/0000-0002-2980-362X; Baden, Tom/0000-0003-2808-4210; Maia Chagas, Andre/0000-0003-2609-3017","European Research Council [677687, 802531]; UKRI (BBSRC) [BB/R014817/1]; UKRI (MRC) [MC_PC_15071]; UKRI (EPSRC) [EP/R014000/1]; Leverhulme Trust [PLP2017-005]; Lister Institute for Preventive Medicine; Shuttleworth Foundation; Francis Crick Institute; European Research Council (ERC) [802531, 677687] Funding Source: European Research Council (ERC); BBSRC [BB/R014817/1] Funding Source: UKRI; GCRF [EP/R014000/1] Funding Source: UKRI; MRC [MC_PC_15071] Funding Source: UKRI",European Research Council(European Research Council (ERC)); UKRI (BBSRC)(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC)); UKRI (MRC)(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Medical Research Council UK (MRC)); UKRI (EPSRC)(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)); Leverhulme Trust(Leverhulme Trust); Lister Institute for Preventive Medicine; Shuttleworth Foundation; Francis Crick Institute; European Research Council (ERC)(European Research Council (ERC)Spanish Government); BBSRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC)); GCRF(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)); MRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Medical Research Council UK (MRC)),"Funding was provided by the European Research Council (ERC-StG ""NeuroVisEco"" 677687 to TB and ERC StG ""EvoNeuroCircuit"" 802531 to LLPG), the UKRI (BBSRC, BB/R014817/1 to TB; MRC, MC_PC_15071 to TB; EPSRC EP/R014000/1 to JCM), the Leverhulme Trust (PLP2017-005 to TB), the Lister Institute for Preventive Medicine (to TB), the Shuttleworth Foundation (to JCM), and The Francis Crick Institute (to LLPG).

In combination, these technologies can overcome data collection and maintenance problems of in situ monitoring in remote and extreme environments. Precision localisation in support of maximum efficiency mid-range inductive power transfer when recharging devices and increased throughput between drone and device are needed for data intensive monitoring applications, and to balance proximity time for devices powered by supercapacitors that recharge in seconds. The platform described in this article incorporates ultra-wideband technology to achieve high-performance ranging and high data throughput. It enables the development of a new localisation system that is experimentally shown to improve accuracy by around two orders of magnitude to 10 cm with respect to GNSS and achieves almost 6 Mbps throughput in both lab and field conditions. These results are supported by extensive modelling and analysis. The platform is designed for application flexibility, and therefore includes a wide range of sensors and expansion possibilities, with source code for two applications made immediately available as part of a open source project to support research and development in this new area.","[Polonelli, Tommaso; Benini, Luca] Univ Bologna, DEI, I-40127 Bologna, Italy; [Qin, Yuan; Yeatman, Eric M.; Boyle, David] Imperial Coll London, Dyson, London SW7 2AZ, England",University of Bologna; Imperial College London; Dyson,"Polonelli, T (corresponding author), Univ Bologna, DEI, I-40127 Bologna, Italy.",tommaso.polonelli2@unibo.it,"Polonelli, Tommaso/AAA-1261-2020","Boyle, David/0000-0002-1993-4482; BENINI, LUCA/0000-0001-8068-3806; Yeatman, Eric/0000-0003-0487-2693",U.K. Government through NSF-UKRI [NE/T011467/1]; NERC [NE/T011467/1] Funding Source: UKRI,U.K. Government through NSF-UKRI; NERC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)),This work was supported by the U.K. Government through NSF-UKRI under Grant NE/T011467/1.,,38,16,16,1,14,IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC,PISCATAWAY,"445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA",2169-3536,,,IEEE ACCESS,IEEE Access,,2020,8,,,,,,164775,164785,,10.1109/ACCESS.2020.3021370,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2020.3021370,,,11,"Computer Science, Information Systems; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Telecommunications",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Computer Science; Engineering; Telecommunications,NT4JY,,"Green Submitted, gold",,,8/15/24,WOS:000572910400001,,0,2312,,0,H

We introduce an optical proxy measurement to detect real-time phase changes in materials. We present correlations between this optical proxy and standard X-ray diffraction measurements, describe some edge cases where the proxy measurement fails, and report key learnings from the technology-translation process. By sharing lessons learned, we hope that future open-hardware development and translation efforts can proceed with reduced friction. Throughout the paper, we provide examples of scientific impact, wherein participating laboratories used their environmental chambers to study and improve the stabilities of halide-perovskite materials.

As a result of this research, an IoT system based on open hardware and software tools was built, which is articulated within the conventional 4-layer IoT architecture (capture, storage, analysis, and visualization). With respect to the existing solutions, the advantage of this system is the use of portable SBC platforms, as well as the inclusion of machine learning models within the analysis layer. From the case study, conducted on a home lettuce crop, it is concluded that the selected tools allow capturing, monitoring, and analyzing climatological variables of interest in urban agriculture crops.

For bringing this technology to AEC classrooms, an open-source TLS was developed. The physical model was built using digital fabrication, its connectivity was established using accessible, affordable, open-source sensors and actuators and its digital representation was developed using generative design tools. All elements together are synchronized in real-time and the TLS becomes live, digitally twinned, geometry generator. The points that are generated by the TLS are gathered in a 3D virtual space in the form of virtual points. The present digitally twinned vision of laser scanning has thus three identified educational uses: (i) illustration of the measuring principle using open-source hardware together with mathematics and statistics, (ii) illustration of the generation and visualization of point clouds in real-time within a CAD environment, and (iii) perhaps with a vaster scope in AEC classrooms, illustration of the usage, analysis and identification of these point clouds. The development of this tool belongs to a vaster project for infusing Construction 4.0 technologies in AEC classrooms under development in xxxxxxxxxxxxx. The illustration to students of all these concepts with accessible technological tools is expected to enlarge their vision of more advanced constructional technologies such as cyber-physical systems for monitoring and surveying as well as digital technologies for reproducing ""As-Built"" models.","[Ramonell, Carlos; Chacon, Rolando] Univ Politecn Cataluna, Sch Civil Engn, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, C Jordi Girona 1-3,Campus Nord UPC,Bldg C1, Barcelona 08034, Spain",Universitat Politecnica de Catalunya,"Chacón, R (corresponding author), Univ Politecn Cataluna, Sch Civil Engn, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, C Jordi Girona 1-3,Campus Nord UPC,Bldg C1, Barcelona 08034, Spain.",,"Chacon, Rolando/K-4755-2015","Chacon, Rolando/0000-0002-7259-5635",European Commission [958161]; Institut de Ciencies de la Educacio.

However, its practical applications within experimental design have been slow to uptake, with researchers unsure where to even start with the dizzying array of open source hardware and software solutions available. The perceived time investment and unknown cost, especially in implementing open source hardware, has stagnated the implementation of inexpensive experimental solutions, but we sought to increase awareness to lower the barrier to participation in this space. While there are countless technical and financial advantages to integrating open source solutions into every biologist's experimental design, we put an emphasis on the ""people"" part of the equation in our symposium. This symposium championed innovative experimental designs by early career Society for Integrative and Comparative Biology researchers across all fields of biology, from plants to animals, in the lab or in the field, or even virtually engaging with the public and students. The Open Science movement operates within community norms that champion transparency, continuous development, and collaboration. These values are congruent with the priorities of reducing barriers to participation in science, and we hope our symposium's collection of open source solutions encourages readers to adopt these or other innovative designs into their own experimentation.","[Tanner, Richelle L.] Chapman Univ, Environm Sci & Policy Program, Orange, CA 92866 USA; [Onthank, Kirt L.] Walla Walla Univ, Dept Biol Sci, College Pl, WA 99324 USA",Chapman University System; Chapman University,"Tanner, RL (corresponding author), Chapman Univ, Environm Sci & Policy Program, Orange, CA 92866 USA.",richelle.tanner@richelletanner.com,,"Onthank, Kirt/0000-0001-7739-0148",Society for Integrative and Comparative Biology,Society for Integrative and Comparative Biology,This work was supported by the Society for Integrative and Comparative Biology.,,20,0,0,0,2,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",1540-7063,1557-7023,,INTEGR COMP BIOL,Integr.

In this paper, an open hardware architecture for designing a modular wireless sensor node for health monitoring is proposed. By separating the connection and sensing functions in two separate boards, compliant with the IEEE1451 standard, we add plug and play capabilities to analog transducers, while granting at the same time a high level of customization. As an additional contribution of the work, we developed a cosimulation tool which simplifies the physical connection with the hardware devices and provides support for complex systems.

A promising technology for the safe and efficient collection of monitoring data is a compact autonomous surface vehicle (ASV), capable of autonomous navigation along a predefined trajectory based on geographic coordinates and measurements in different places and depths. In this practical paper, the development process, technical details and functional testing results of a low-cost ASV for WSP monitoring are presented. Commonly available construction materials and electronic components were used to ensure affordability and reparability. The access to online tutorials and peer-support was crucial for assembling the open-source autopilot and data logger. The ASV demonstrated satisfactory performance for both the autonomous navigation as well as the georeferenced data logging of measurements at a real-scale WSP in Paraguay.

Applications range from prototyping to small-scale production, with 3D printing offering reduced logistics overheads, better design flexibility and ease of use compared with traditional fabrication methods. In addition, printer and material costs have also decreased rapidly. These advantages make 3D printing attractive for application in microfluidic chip fabrication. However, 3D printing microfluidics is still a new area. Is the technology mature enough to print complex microchannel geometries, such as droplet microfluidics? Can 3D-printed droplet microfluidic chips be used in biological or chemical applications? Is 3D printing mature enough to be used in every research lab? These are the questions we will seek answers to in our systematic review. We will analyze (1) the key performance metrics of 3D-printed droplet microfluidics and (2) existing biological or chemical application areas. In addition, we evaluate (3) the potential of large-scale application of 3D printing microfluidics. Finally, (4) we discuss how 3D printing and digital design automation could trivialize microfluidic chip fabrication in the long term. Based on our analysis, we can conclude that today, 3D printers could already be used in every research lab.

However, more information has not translated into a greater understanding of disease complexity to satisfy diagnostic and therapeutic needs. Challenges include noncompatible technology platforms, the need for wide-scale and long-term deployment of sensor technology (among vulnerable elderly patients in particular), and the gap between the big data acquired with sensitive measurement technologies and their limited clinical application. Major opportunities could be realized if new technologies are developed as part of open-source and/or open-hardware platforms that enable multichannel data capture sensitive to the broad range of motor and nonmotor problems that characterize PD and are adaptable into self-adjusting, individualized treatment delivery systems. The International Parkinson and Movement Disorders Society Task Force on Technology is entrusted to convene engineers, clinicians, researchers, and patients to promote the development of integrated measurement and closed-loop therapeutic systems with high patient adherence that also serve to (1) encourage the adoption of clinico-pathophysiologic phenotyping and early detection of critical disease milestones, (2) enhance the tailoring of symptomatic therapy, (3) improve subgroup targeting of patients for future testing of disease-modifying treatments, and (4) identify objective biomarkers to improve the longitudinal tracking of impairments in clinical care and research.

In addition, parametric modeling is encouraged in order to facilitate customization for other experiments. Parametric design using a solid modeling programming language allows customization and provides a source file for the design. OpenSCAD is the most widely used scripting tool for parametric modeling of open source labware. However, OpenSCAD lacks the ability to export to standard parametric formats; thus, the parametric dimensional information of the model is lost. This is an important deficiency because it is key to share the design in the most accessible formats with no information loss. In this work we analyze OpenSCAD and compare it with FreeCAD Python scripts. We have created a parametric open source hardware design to compare these tools. Our findings show that although Python for FreeCAD is more arduous to learn, its advantages counterbalance the initial difficulties. The main benefits are being able to export to standard parametric models; using Python language with its libraries; and the ability to use and integrate the models in its graphical interface. Thus, making it more appropriate to design open source hardware for scientific equipment.","[Machado, Felipe; Malpica, Norberto; Borromeo, Susana] Univ Rey Juan Carlos, Area Elect Technol, Mostoles, Spain",Universidad Rey Juan Carlos,"Machado, F (corresponding author), Univ Rey Juan Carlos, Area Elect Technol, Mostoles, Spain.",felipe.machado@urjc.es,"Machado, Felipe/N-5051-2018; Borromeo, Susana/K-5376-2012; Malpica, Norberto/I-2090-2015","Machado, Felipe/0000-0001-7674-0943; Borromeo, Susana/0000-0002-2353-2902; Malpica, Norberto/0000-0003-4618-7459","Spanish Department of Economy and Competitiveness [RTC-2015-4167-1]; Spanish Department of Science, Innovation and Universities [RTC-2017-62181]","Spanish Department of Economy and Competitiveness; Spanish Department of Science, Innovation and Universities","N.M. and S.B. were supported by Spanish Department of Economy and Competitiveness grant RTC-2015-4167-1 (http://www.mineco.gob.es/; this department changed its name); and Spanish Department of Science, Innovation and Universities grant RTC-2017-62181 (http://www.ciencia.gob.es/).The funders had no role in study design, data collection and analysis, decision to publish, or preparation of the manuscript.",,41,21,21,6,15,PUBLIC LIBRARY SCIENCE,SAN FRANCISCO,"1160 BATTERY STREET, STE 100, SAN FRANCISCO, CA 94111 USA",1932-6203,,,PLOS ONE,PLoS One,5-Dec,2019,14,12,,,,,,,e0225795,10.1371/journal.pone.0225795,http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0225795,,,30,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Science & Technology - Other Topics,LP0JY,31805116,"Green Published, gold",,,8/15/24,WOS:000534009700060,,0,2327,,0,H

To this end, a conceptual prototype was built based on free software and open hardware technologies as a low-cost alternative to commercial equipment while maintaining the accuracy and quality of the data at the same level. The prototype was based on electrode multiplexing to make the switching process more efficient by reducing cabling complexity, whereas synchronous demodulation for signal detection was employed, providing strong rejection of spurious electrical noise, typical of urban areas where such equipment is frequently used.

The applications of commercialized metal 3-D printers are limited to only rapid prototyping and expensive finished products. This severely restricts the access of the technology for small and medium enterprises, the developing world and for use in laboratories. This paper reports on the development of a <$2000 open-source metal 3-D printer. The metal 3-D printer is controlled with an open-source micro-controller and is a combination of a low-cost commercial gas-metal arc welder and a derivative of the Rostock, a deltabot RepRap.

Although these renewable energy sources are now lower-cost than fossil fuels, their inherent intermittency makes them unable to supply a constant load without storage. To address these challenges, rechargeable electric batteries are currently the most promising option; however, their high capital costs limit current deployment velocities. To both reduce the cost as well as improve performance, 3D printing technology has emerged as a promising solution. This literature review provides state-of-the-art enhancements of battery properties with 3D printing, including efficiency, mechanical stability, energy and power density, customizability and sizing, production process efficiency, material conservation, and environmental sustainability as well as the progress in solid-state batteries. The principles, advantages, limitations, and recent advancements associated with the most common types of 3D printing are reviewed focusing on their contributions to the battery field. 3D printing battery components as well as full batteries offer design flexibility, geometric freedom, and material flexibility, reduce pack weight, minimize material waste, increase the range of applications, and have the potential to reduce costs.

However, the effectiveness of peer assessment is not always satisfactory due to a number of factors, such as lack of in-depth understanding of peers' work and insufficient motivation for the behavior of evaluation. Based on constructivist theory, this study proposed an Understanding-Evaluation-Backward EvaluationReflection based peer assessment (UEBR-PA) approach, which directs students to comprehensively grasp their peers' projects, undertake efficient evaluations, provide retrospective reviews on others' feedback, and ultimately, integrate this collective feedback to refine and enhance their own projects. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, a quasi-experiment was conducted in an Open-Source Hardware Project Design course with 54 university students from two classes. One class was assigned as the experimental group to conduct the peer assessment using the proposed approach, while the other class was assigned as the control group to conduct the peer assessment using the conventional presentation-evaluation-communication based approach. The results of the study indicated that the UEBR-PA approach significantly increased students' creative self-efficacy, critical thinking tendency, and learning performance. Furthermore, students engaging with the UEBR-PA approach showcased more positive interactive assessment behaviors.","[Wang, Xiao-Ming] Zhejiang Normal Univ, Zhejiang Key Lab Intelligent Educ Technol & Applic, Jinhua 321004, Zhejiang, Peoples R China; [Huang, Xiao-Tong; Hu, Qing-Nan] Zhejiang Normal Univ, Coll Educ, Jinhua 321004, Peoples R China; [Han, Ya-Hui] Zhejiang Inst Mech & Elect Technician, Yiwu 322000, Peoples R China",Zhejiang Normal University; Zhejiang Normal University,"Wang, XM (corresponding author), Zhejiang Normal Univ, 688 Yingbin Rd, Jinhua 321004, Zhejiang, Peoples R China.",zsdwxm@126.com,,,Higher Education Teaching Reform Project of Zhejiang Province [JG-2022-0146],Higher Education Teaching Reform Project of Zhejiang Province,This study is supported in part by the Higher Education Teaching Reform Project of Zhejiang Province under contract numbers JG-2022-0146.,,109,0,0,4,4,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,London,"125 London Wall, London, ENGLAND",1871-1871,1878-0423,,THINK SKILLS CREAT,Think.

Even though low-cost sensors emerged a few decades ago, versatile and cheap electronics like Arduino could give stormwater researchers a new opportunity to build their own monitoring systems to support their work. To find out sensors which are ready for low-cost stormwater monitoring systems, for the first time, we review the performance assessments of low-cost sensors for monitoring air humidity, wind speed, solar radiation, rainfall, water level, water flow, soil moisture, water pH, conductivity, turbidity, nitrogen, and phosphorus in a unified metrological framework considering numerous parameters. In general, as these low-cost sensors are not initially designed for scientific monitoring, there is extra work to make them suitable for in situ monitoring, to calibrate them, to validate their performance, and to connect them with open-source hardware for data transmission. We, therefore, call for international cooperation to develop uniform low-cost sensor production, interface, performance, calibration and system design, installation, and data validation guides which will greatly regulate and facilitate the sharing of experience and knowledge.","[Zhu, Qingchuan; Cherqui, Frederic; Bertrand-Krajewski, Jean-Luc] Univ Lyon, INSA Lyon, DEEP, EA7429, F-69621 Villeurbanne, France; [Cherqui, Frederic] Univ Lyon, Univ Claude Bernard Lyon 1, F-69622 Villeurbanne, France",Institut National des Sciences Appliquees de Lyon - INSA Lyon; Universite Claude Bernard Lyon 1,"Zhu, QC (corresponding author), Univ Lyon, INSA Lyon, DEEP, EA7429, F-69621 Villeurbanne, France.",qingchuan.zhu@insa-lyon.fr,"Cherqui, Frederic/AAJ-5281-2020","Cherqui, Frederic/0000-0001-8836-3970",European Union [786566]; Rhone-Mediterranee-Corse Water Agency under the Cheap'Eau project - China Scholarship Council [201806560056]; Rhpne-Mediterranee-Corse Water Agency under the Cheap' Eau project; China Scholarship Council [201806560056]; Marie Curie Actions (MSCA) [786566] Funding Source: Marie Curie Actions (MSCA),European Union(European Union (EU)); Rhone-Mediterranee-Corse Water Agency under the Cheap'Eau project - China Scholarship Council; Rhpne-Mediterranee-Corse Water Agency under the Cheap' Eau project; China Scholarship Council(China Scholarship Council); Marie Curie Actions (MSCA)(Marie Curie Actions),"This research received financial support from the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under Grant Agreement no. 786566 (https://mind4stormwater.org), and from the Rhpne-Mediterranee-Corse Water Agency under the Cheap' Eau project.

IP has been the de facto standard for seamless interconnectivity in the traditional Internet; and piggybacking on the success of IP, 6LoWPAN has been the first standardized technology to realize it for networks of resource-constrained devices. In the recent past Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) a.k.a Bluetooth Smart - a subset of the Bluetooth v4.0 and the latest v4.2 stack, has surfaced as an appealing alternative, with many competing advantages over available low-power communication technologies in the IoT space such as IEEE 802.15.4. However, BLE is a closed standard and lacks open hardware and firmware support, something that hinders innovation and development in this field. In this article, we aim to overcome some of the constraints in BLE's core building blocks by making three contributions: first, we present the design of a new open hardware platform for BLE; second, we provide a Contiki O.S. port for the new platform; and third, we identify research challenges and opportunities in 6LoWPAN-connected Bluetooth Smart.

China's makers demonstrate that the future of makingif to materialize in the ways currently envisioned by writers, politicians, and scholars of the global tech industryrests on taking seriously the technological and cultural fabrics of professional making outside familiar information technology innovation hubs like Silicon Valley: making-do, mass production, and reuse. I trace back to China's first hackerspace, documenting how a collective of makers began to move away from appropriating Western concepts of openness toward promoting China as source for knowledge, creativity, and innovation. This article demonstrates that when China's makers set up open hardware businesses and articulate a unique culture of hacking with Chinese characteristics, they draw boundaries between the professional making they saw embodied in Chinese industrial production and the hobbyist making embodied in Western histories and cultures of hacking. In so doing, they position China as site of both technological and cultural expertise, intervening in dominant conceptions of computing that split manufacturing and innovation along geographical lines.

The planetary roller screw is fabricated in dishwasher-safe polyethylene terephthalate glycol (PETG) on an open source machine and tested using an open source testing platform to determine if it could maintain a constant load without slipping and the maximum force. Then, this output is compared to a direct screw press using the same materials. The results found that the maximum force is more than doubled for the roller screw actuator using the same materials, making them adequate for some food processing techniques. Future work is outlined to improve the performance and ease of assembly.","[Guadagno, Marcello C.] Michigan Technol Univ, Dept Mech Engn Engn Mech, Houghton, MI 49931 USA; [Loss, Jacob M.; Pearce, Joshua M.] Michigan Technol Univ, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, Houghton, MI 49931 USA; [Pearce, Joshua M.] Michigan Technol Univ, Dept Mat Sci & Engn, Houghton, MI 49931 USA; [Pearce, Joshua M.] Aalto Univ, Sch Elect Engn, Dept Elect & Nanoengn, FI-00076 Espoo, Finland",Michigan Technological University; Michigan Technological University; Michigan Technological University; Aalto University,"Pearce, JM (corresponding author), Michigan Technol Univ, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, Houghton, MI 49931 USA.; Pearce, JM (corresponding author), Michigan Technol Univ, Dept Mat Sci & Engn, Houghton, MI 49931 USA.; Pearce, JM (corresponding author), Aalto Univ, Sch Elect Engn, Dept Elect & Nanoengn, FI-00076 Espoo, Finland.",mcguadag@mtu.edu; jmloss@mtu.edu; pearce@mtu.edu,"Pearce, Joshua/C-9240-2013","Pearce, Joshua/0000-0001-9802-3056",Witte Endowment; Aleph Objects,Witte Endowment; Aleph Objects,This research was supported by the Witte Endowment and Aleph Objects.,,75,5,5,1,11,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2227-7080,,TECHNOLOGIES,Technologies,JUN,2021,9,2,,,,,,,24,10.3390/technologies9020024,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/technologies9020024,,,26,"Engineering, Multidisciplinary",Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI),Engineering,SX7JB,,"gold, Green Published",,,8/15/24,WOS:000665375300001,,0,2340,,0,H

Some sensors deployed for these purposes such as temperature, relative humidity, atmospheric pressure, and carbon dioxide sensors require protection from climate factors to avoid bias. Radiation shields hold and protect sensors to avoid this bias, but commercial systems are limited, often expensive, and difficult to implement in low-cost contexts or large deployments for collaborative sensing. To overcome these challenges, this work presents an open source, easily adapted and customized design of a radiation shield. The device can be fabricated with inexpensive off-the-shelf parts and 3-D printed components and can be adapted to protect and isolate different types of sensors. Two material approaches are tested here: polylactic acid (PLA), the most common 3-D printing filament, and acrylonitrile styrene acrylate (ASA), which is known to offer better resistance against UV radiation, greater hardness, and generally higher resistance to degradation. To validate the designs, the two prototypes were installed on a custom outdoor meteorological system and temperature and humidity measurements were made in several locations for one month and compared against a proprietary system and a system with no shield. The 3-D printed materials were also both tested multiple times for one month for UV stability of their mechanical properties, their optical transmission and deformation under outdoor high-heat conditions. The results showed that ASA is the preferred material for this design and that the open source radiation shield could match the performance of proprietary systems. The open source system can be constructed for about nine US dollars, which enables mass development of flexible weather stations for monitoring needed in smart agriculture.(c) 2022 The Author(s).

Microalgae cultivation techniques have evolved and improved, but a vast amount of research is still needed to achieve a better understanding of these microorganisms. Due to this, there is a growing need for affordable, flexible, and easy to control research systems and protocols. 3D printing revolutionized design and manufacturing as it became widely available to the mass market, allowing the creation of novel forms, enabling mass customization, and supporting low-volume, distributed production. The emergence of open source designs combined with 3D printing applications have the potential to replace and outperform standard designs and methods.

However, affordable tools are often constrained to short-term studies due to high energy consumption and limited storage. To enable long-term monitoring, energy and space efficiency must be improved on such tools. This paper describes the development and deployment of three acoustic detection algorithms that reduce the power and storage requirements of acoustic monitoring on affordable, open-source hardware. The algorithms aim to detect bat echolocation, to search for evidence of an endangered cicada species, and also to collect evidence of poaching in a protected nature reserve. The algorithms are designed to run on AudioMoth: a low-cost, open-source acoustic monitoring device, developed by the authors and widely adopted by the conservation community. Each algorithm addresses a detection task of increasing complexity, implementing extra analytical steps to account for environmental conditions such as wind, analysing samples multiple times to prevent missed events, and incorporating a hidden Markov model for sample classification in both the time and frequency domain. For each algorithm, we report on real-world deployments carried out with partner organisations and also benchmark the hidden Markov model against a convolutional neural network, a deep-learning technique commonly used for acoustics. The deployments demonstrate how acoustic detection algorithms extend the use of low-cost, open-source hardware and facilitate a new avenue for conservation researchers to perform large-scale monitoring.","[Prince, Peter; Hill, Andrew] Univ Southampton, Sch Elect & Comp Sci, Southampton SO17 1BJ, Hants, England; [Covarrubias, Evelyn Pina; Doncaster, Patrick] Univ Southampton, Sch Biol Sci, Southampton SO17 1BJ, Hants, England; [Snaddon, Jake L.] Univ Southampton, Sch Geog & Environm Sci, Southampton SO17 1BJ, Hants, England; [Rogers, Alex] Univ Oxford, Dept Comp Sci, Oxford OX1 2JD, England",University of Southampton; University of Southampton; University of Southampton; University of Oxford,"Prince, P (corresponding author), Univ Southampton, Sch Elect & Comp Sci, Southampton SO17 1BJ, Hants, England.",pcp1g11@soton.ac.uk; ah1u14@soton.ac.uk; e.pinacovarrubias@soton.ac.uk; cpd@soton.ac.uk; j.l.snaddon@soton.ac.uk; alex.rogers@cs.ox.ac.uk,"Doncaster, C.

However, the fast-growing field relies heavily on specialized fabrication facilities and research equipment, which limits the active participation of researchers and beginners outside microfluidics. With the growing paradigm on do-it-yourself (DIY) biology and open-source (OS) hardware, there are many efforts to create microfluidic products by using publicly-shared or easy-to-use principles. Although this approach to technology innovation has already been initiated in the field of microfluidics, the literature on OS and DIY microfluidics is still disseminated in individual journals. In this review, we provide an overview of OS and DIY microfluidics and related technologies, in particular, how microfluidic devices can be fabricated without specialized manufacturing equipment and microfabrication facilities, and how laboratory equipment that is required to perform microfluidics research can be recreated to be affordable and customizable without specialized expertise. Thus, this review introduces subtractive and additive micromachining technologies such as laser cutting, milling, and 3D printing that are accessible even to beginners, and compare their pros and cons for microfabrication. Then, OS and DIY instruments essential for operation of microfluidic devices including precision pumps, microscopes, and centrifuges are reviewed. We discuss the challenges associated with the more-accessible, wide-spread use of microfluidics as well as potential strategies to address these challenges, which can lead to individual- and community-driven microfluidics innovation.","[Shin, Joong Ho] Pukyong Univ, Dept Biomed Engn, Busan 48513, South Korea; [Shin, Joong Ho] Pukyong Natl Univ, Ind Convergence Bion Engn 4 0, Busan, South Korea; [Choi, Sungyoung] Hanyang Univ, Dept Biomed Engn, Seoul 04763, South Korea; [Choi, Sungyoung] Hanyang Univ, Dept Elect Engn, Seoul 04763, South Korea; [Choi, Sungyoung] Hanyang Univ, Inst Nano Sci & Technol, Seoul, South Korea",Pukyong National University; Pukyong National University; Hanyang University; Hanyang University; Hanyang University,"Shin, JH (corresponding author), Pukyong Univ, Dept Biomed Engn, Busan 48513, South Korea.; Choi, S (corresponding author), Hanyang Univ, Dept Biomed Engn, Seoul 04763, South Korea.",jhshin@pknu.ac.kr; sungyoung@hanyang.ac.kr,,"Shin, Joong Ho/0000-0001-9568-8618","Basic Science Research Programthrough the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) - Ministry of Science, ICT & Future Planning (MSIP) [2020R1A2C1099869]; NRF - MSIP [2016R1A5A1010148]; National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) - Korean government (MSIT) [2020R1C1C1003567]; Korea Sanhak Foundation (KSF)","Basic Science Research Programthrough the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) - Ministry of Science, ICT & Future Planning (MSIP); NRF - MSIP; National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) - Korean government (MSIT)(National Research Foundation of Korea); Korea Sanhak Foundation (KSF)","This research was supported by the Basic Science Research Programthrough the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) funded by the Ministry of Science, ICT & Future Planning (MSIP) (2020R1A2C1099869) , and an NRF grant funded by the MSIP (2016R1A5A1010148) .

Therefore, and considering that COVID-19 generally causes damage to the respiratory system (in the form of lung infection), it is essential to ensure the best pulmonary ventilation for the patient. However, depending on the severity of the disease and the health condition of the patient, the situation can become critical when the patient has respiratory distress or becomes unable to breathe on his/her own. In that case, the ventilator becomes the lifeline of the patient. This device must keep patients stable until, on their own or with the help of medications, they manage to overcome the lung infection. However, with thousands or hundreds of thousands of infected patients, no country has enough ventilators. If this situation has become critical in the Global North, it has turned disastrous in developing countries, where ventilators are even more scarce.

To achieve this purpose, we use open-source software and hardware tools to create a piece of educational equipment that is fully configurable for different sensors. We present the experimental results of two case studies: the vibration analysis of a rotor-bearing system using acceleration signals and a free-vibration study using a xylophone and a low-cost microphone. The proposed platform helps authors to complement a 4-month course named Vibration, intended for mechanical engineering students. The students who participated in the study demonstrated an improvement in their comprehension of vibration theory and modal analysis using the finite element technique.

This approach reduced the cost of reliable closed reflux COD by two orders of magnitude making it an economic alternative for the vast majority of potential users. The open-source colorimeter demonstrated good reproducibility and serves as a platform for further development and derivation of the design for other, similar purposes such as nephelometry. This approach promises unprecedented access to sophisticated instrumentation based on low-cost sensors by those most in need of it, under-developed and developing world laboratories.","[Anzalone, Gerald C.] Michigan Technol Univ, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Houghton, MI 49931 USA; [Glover, Alexandra G.; Pearce, Joshua M.] Michigan Technol Univ, Dept Mat Sci & Engn, Houghton, MI 49931 USA; [Pearce, Joshua M.] Michigan Technol Univ, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, Houghton, MI 49931 USA",Michigan Technological University; Michigan Technological University; Michigan Technological University,"Pearce, JM (corresponding author), Michigan Technol Univ, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, 1400 Townsend Dr, Houghton, MI 49931 USA.",gcanzalo@mtu.edu; agglover@mtu.edu; pearce@mtu.edu,"Pearce, Joshua/D-2052-2010","Pearce, Joshua/0000-0001-9802-3056; Glover, Alexandra/0000-0003-0297-0820",,,,,32,79,83,1,121,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",1424-8220,,,SENSORS-BASEL,Sensors,APR,2013,13,4,,,,,5338,5346,,10.3390/s130405338,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/s130405338,,,9,"Chemistry, Analytical; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Instruments & Instrumentation",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Chemistry; Engineering; Instruments & Instrumentation,131ZC,23604032,"Green Published, gold",,,8/15/24,WOS:000318036400075,,0,2348,,0,H

Arduino, a representative and popular open-source hardware, can acquire information from various sensors, transmit data using communication technology, and control devices through actuators. The review was conducted by classifying previous studies into three types of Arduino applications: field monitoring systems, wearable systems, and autonomous systems. With regard to field monitoring systems, most studies in mines were classified as atmospheric or geotechnical monitoring. In wearable systems, the health status of the miner was an important consideration, in addition to the environmental conditions of the mine. Arduino can be a useful tool as an initial prototype for autonomous mine systems. Arduino has advantages in that it can be combined with various electronic products and is cost-effective. Therefore, although many studies have been conducted in the laboratory (as opposed to field tests), Arduino applications can be further expanded in the mining field in the future.","[Kim, Sung-Min; Suh, Jangwon] Kangwon Natl Univ, Dept Energy Engn, Samcheok 25913, South Korea; [Choi, Yosoon] Pukyong Natl Univ, Dept Energy Resources Engn, Busan 48513, South Korea",Kangwon National University; Pukyong National University,"Choi, Y (corresponding author), Pukyong Natl Univ, Dept Energy Resources Engn, Busan 48513, South Korea.",smkim19@kangwon.ac.kr; energy@pknu.ac.kr; jangwonsuh@kangwon.ac.kr,,"Choi, Yosoon/0000-0001-9616-3725; Suh, Jangwon/0000-0002-5724-428X",Basic Science Research Program through the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) - Ministry of Science and ICT [2020R1G1A1010789],"Basic Science Research Program through the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) - Ministry of Science and ICT(National Research Foundation of KoreaMinistry of Science, ICT & Future Planning, Republic of Korea)",This work was supported by Basic Science Research Program through the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) funded by the Ministry of Science and ICT (2020R1G1A1010789).,,69,19,20,9,40,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2076-3417,,APPL SCI-BASEL,Appl.

It focuses on the use of do-it-yourself (DIY) aerial photography with balloons and kites, alongside other collaborative practices, for mapping and visualizing Bedouin political and spatial claims. Against a backdrop of increasingly technologically savvy legal-professional cultures in human-rights organizations, this article proposes that a community-based DIY approach to truth making may challenge entrenched thresholds of participation and open opportunities for creating hybrid forums in the human-rights field.

The target is to adapt open-source 3D printers to be helpful in research lines that use gels, hydrogels, pastes, inks, and bio-inks. Design/methodology/approach This hardware was designed to be compatible with a Graber i3-based 3D printer; nevertheless, it can be easily adapted to other open-source 3D printers. Findings The extrusion head successfully deposits the material during the 3D printing process. It was validated fabricating geometries that include scaffold structures, which are a possible application of bioprinting for tissue engineering. As reported, the extruded filaments allowed the porous samples' structuration. Practical implications This system expands the applications of open-source 3D printers used at the laboratory scale. It enables low-cost access to research areas such as tissue engineering and biofabrication, energy storage devices and food 3D printing. Originality/value The open-source hardware here reported is of simple fabrication, assembly and installation. It uses a Cardan coupling and a three guides system to transfer the stepper motor motion. This approach allows continuous movement transfer to the syringe piston, producing an adequate deposition or retraction. Thus, the effect of misalignments is avoided, considering that these latter can cause skipping steps in the motor, directly affecting the deposition.","[Davila, Jose Luis; Manzini, Bruna Maria; Lopes da Silva, Jorge Vicente] Ctr Tecnol Informacao Renato Archer, LAprint 3D Printing Open Lab, Campinas, Brazil; [D'Avila, Marcos Akira] Univ Estadual Campinas, Sch Mech Engn, Dept Mfg & Mat Engn, Campinas, Brazil",Universidade Estadual de Campinas,"Dávila, JL (corresponding author), Ctr Tecnol Informacao Renato Archer, LAprint 3D Printing Open Lab, Campinas, Brazil.",jose.davila@cti.gov.br,"d´Ávila, Marcos A/B-9083-2012; Dávila, José Luis/AIE-9391-2022","Davila, Jose Luis/0000-0003-0502-5963","FAPESP [2019/02772-7, 2021/07212-0]; iCan micro-enterprise",FAPESP(Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de Sao Paulo (FAPESP)); iCan micro-enterprise,J.

However, each IoT platform has its own way of configuring peripherals, and it is difficult for programmers or users to configure the same peripheral on a different platform. Although diverse open-source IoT platforms are widespread, the difficulty in programming those platforms hinders the growth of IoT applications. Therefore, we propose an easy and convenient way to program and configure the operation of each peripheral using a user-friendly Web-based software framework.

Today, the combination of sensors with communication technologies permits to monitor these crucial parameters in real-time, allowing to take fast management decisions. However, out-of-the-box solutions are expensive, due to the small market and the industrial nature of sensors, besides being little customizable. To solve this, the present work describes a low-cost hardware and software architecture developed to achieve the autonomous water quality assessment and management on a remote facility for fish conservation aquaculture within the framework of the Smart Comunidad Rural Digital (smartCRD) project. The developed sensor network has been working uninterruptedly since its installation (20 April 2021). It is based on open source technology and includes a central gateway for on-site data monitoring of water quality nodes as well as an online management platform for data visualization and sensor network configuration. Likewise, the system can detect autonomously water quality parameters outside configurable thresholds and deliver management alarms. The described architecture, besides low-cost, is highly customizable, compatible with other sensor network projects, machine-learning applications, and is capable of edge computing. Thus, it contributes to making open sensorization more accessible to real-world applications.","[Francisco Fuentes-Perez, Juan; Javier Sanz-Ronda, Francisco] Univ Valladolid, ETSIIAA, Dept Hydraul & Hydrol, Palencia 34004, Spain; [Francisco Fuentes-Perez, Juan] Ctr Tecnol Agr & Agroalimentario Itagra Ct, Avda Madrid 44, Palencia 34004, Spain",Universidad de Valladolid,"Fuentes-Pérez, JF (corresponding author), Univ Valladolid, ETSIIAA, Dept Hydraul & Hydrol, Palencia 34004, Spain.; Fuentes-Pérez, JF (corresponding author), Ctr Tecnol Agr & Agroalimentario Itagra Ct, Avda Madrid 44, Palencia 34004, Spain.",jfuentes@iaf.uva.es; jsanz@uva.es,"Sanz-Ronda, Francisco Javier/E-9087-2016; Fuentes, Juan Francisco/N-3312-2015","Sanz-Ronda, Francisco Javier/0000-0003-4566-9499; Fuentes, Juan Francisco/0000-0003-2384-9085","Smart Comunidad Rural Digital, a European Interreg program, V-A Spain-Portugal (2014-2020); Torres Quevedo grant [PTQ2018-010162]","Smart Comunidad Rural Digital, a European Interreg program, V-A Spain-Portugal (2014-2020); Torres Quevedo grant","This project has received funding from Smart Comunidad Rural Digital (www.smartcrd.eu, accessed on 20 July 2021), a European Interreg program, V-A Spain-Portugal (2014-2020), directed by the General Directorate of Telecommunications and Digital Transformation of the Junta de Castilla y Leon (Spain).

Functionally and energy optimized hardware systems and development tools maybe is the most critical facet of this technology for the achievement of such prospects. Especially, in the area of agriculture, where the hostile operating environment comes to add to the general technological and technical issues, reliable and robust WSAN systems are mandatory. This paper focuses on the hardware design architectures of the WSANs for real-world agricultural applications. It presents the available alternatives in hardware design and identifies their difficulties and problems for real-life implementations. The paper introduces SensoTube, a new WSAN hardware architecture, which is proposed as a solution to the various existing design constraints of WSANs. The establishment of the proposed architecture is based, firstly on an abstraction approach in the functional requirements context, and secondly, on the standardization of the subsystems connectivity, in order to allow for an open, expandable, flexible, reconfigurable, energy optimized, reliable and robust hardware system. The SensoTube implementation reference model together with its encapsulation design and installation are analyzed and presented in details. Furthermore, as a proof of concept, certain use cases have been studied in order to demonstrate the benefits of migrating existing designs based on the available open-source hardware platforms to SensoTube architecture.","[Piromalis, Dimitrios; Arvanitis, Konstantinos] Agr Univ Athens, Dept Nat Resources Management & Agr Engn, Iera Odoos 75, Athens 11855, Greece; [Piromalis, Dimitrios] Piraeus Univ Appl Sci TEI Piraeus, Dept Automat Engn, P Ralli & Thivon 250, Egaleo 12244, Greece",Agricultural University of Athens; University of West Attica,"Piromalis, D (corresponding author), Agr Univ Athens, Dept Nat Resources Management & Agr Engn, Iera Odoos 75, Athens 11855, Greece.; Piromalis, D (corresponding author), Piraeus Univ Appl Sci TEI Piraeus, Dept Automat Engn, P Ralli & Thivon 250, Egaleo 12244, Greece.",piromali@teipir.gr; karvan@aua.gr,"Arvanitis, Konstantinos/CAH-3320-2022","Arvanitis, Konstantinos/0000-0002-5778-6644; Piromalis, Dimitrios/0000-0002-2711-1400",Piraeus University of Applied Sciences [80257],Piraeus University of Applied Sciences,This study was conducted with the financial support of the Research Program No. 80257 for ARM MCUs of the Piraeus University of Applied Sciences.,,128,17,18,2,22,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,1424-8220,,SENSORS-BASEL,Sensors,AUG,2016,16,8,,,,,,,1227,10.3390/s16081227,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/s16081227,,,59,"Chemistry, Analytical; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Instruments & Instrumentation",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Chemistry; Engineering; Instruments & Instrumentation,DU6KJ,27527180,"Green Submitted, gold, Green Published",,,8/15/24,WOS:000382323200115,,0,2357,,0,H

Synthetic biology is also growing in many developing countries of Africa, Asia and Latin America, where it could have a large economic impact by helping its use of genetic biodiversity in order to boost existing industries. Starting in 2011, Argentine synthetic biology developed along an idiosyncratic path. In 2011-2012, the main focus was not exclusively research but also on community building through teaching and participation in iGEM, following the template of the early ""MIT school"" of synthetic biology. In 2013-2015, activities diversified and included society-centered projects, social science studies on synthetic biology and bioart. Standard research outputs such as articles and industrial applications helped consolidate several academic working groups. Since 2016, the lack of a critical mass of researchers and a funding crisis were partially compensated by establishing links with Latin American synthetic biologists and with other socially oriented open technology collectives. The TECNOx community is a central node in this growing research and technology network. The first four annual TECNOx meetings brought together synthetic biologists with other open science and engineering platforms and explored the relationship of Latin American technologies with entrepreneurship, open hardware, ethics and human rights. In sum, the socioeconomic context encouraged Latin American synthetic biology to develop in a meandering and diversifying manner. This revealed alternative ways for growth of the field that may be relevant to other developing countries.","[Nadra, Alejandro D.] Univ Buenos Aires, Inst Biociencias Biotecnol & Biol Traslac iB3, Consejo Nacl Invest Cient & Tec,Fac Ciencias Exac, Dept Fisiol & Biol Mol & Celular,Inst Quim Biol,I, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina; [Rodriguez, Pablo E.] Univ Buenos Aires, Inst Invest Gino Germani, Consejo Nacl Invest Cient & Tecn, Fac Ciencias Sociales, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina; [Grunberg, Raik] KAUST, CBRC, Div Biol & Environm Sci & Engn BESE, Thuwal, Saudi Arabia; [Olalde, Laura G.; Sanchez, Ignacio E.] Univ Buenos Aires, Consejo Nacl Invest Cient & Tecn, Fac Ciencias Exactas & Nat, Prot Physiol Lab,Inst Quim Biol,IQUIBICEN, UBA Pabellon 2,Ciudad Univ, RA-1428 Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina",University of Buenos Aires; University of Buenos Aires; Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Cientificas y Tecnicas (CONICET); King Abdullah University of Science & Technology; University of Buenos Aires; Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Cientificas y Tecnicas (CONICET),"Rodríguez, PE (corresponding author), Univ Buenos Aires, Inst Invest Gino Germani, Consejo Nacl Invest Cient & Tecn, Fac Ciencias Sociales, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina.; Sánchez, IE (corresponding author), Univ Buenos Aires, Consejo Nacl Invest Cient & Tecn, Fac Ciencias Exactas & Nat, Prot Physiol Lab,Inst Quim Biol,IQUIBICEN, UBA Pabellon 2,Ciudad Univ, RA-1428 Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina.; Nadra, AD (corresponding author), Univ Buenos Aires, Consejo Nacl Invest Cient & Tecn, Dept Fisiol Biol Mol & Celular,IQUIBICEN, Fac Ciencias Exactas & Nat,Inst Quim Biol,Inst Bi, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina.",anadra@qi.fcen.uba.ar; prodriguez@sociales.uba.ar; isanchez@qb.fcen.uba.ar,"Rodriguez, Pablo/KFJ-9680-2024; Sanchez, Ignacio/A-5658-2009; Grunberg, Raik/A-1839-2011; Nadra, Alejandro/A-5668-2009","Sanchez, Ignacio/0000-0003-4284-9013; Grunberg, Raik/0000-0001-9532-6043; Nadra, Alejandro/0000-0002-7860-3245",,,,,59,3,3,2,21,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0738-8551,1549-7801,,CRIT REV BIOTECHNOL,Crit.

The drive towards smart cities has produced the need for smart sensors to be able to monitor what is happening in our cities. This, combined with the decrease in hardware component prices and the increase in the popularity of open hardware, has favored the deployment of sensor networks based on open hardware. The new trends in Internet Protocol (IP) communication between sensor nodes allow sensor access via the Internet, turning them into smart objects (Internet of Things and Web of Things). Currently, WSNs provide data in different formats. There is a lack of communication protocol standardization, which turns into interoperability issues when connecting different sensor networks or even when connecting different sensor nodes within the same network. This work presents a sensorized platform proposal that adheres to the principles of the Internet of Things and the Web of Things. Wireless sensor nodes were built using open hardware solutions, and communications rely on the HTTP/IP Internet protocols. The Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) SensorThings API candidate standard was used as a neutral format to avoid interoperability issues. An environmental WSN developed following the proposed architecture was built as a proof of concept.

IoT must be a part of the educational curriculum in higher education and follow a project-based learning pedagogy. This article describes a teaching framework for embedded systems and IoT, supported by a remote laboratory (RL) to allow students to work on project-based learning. RLs are online environments that let remote users access physical hardware. The hardware is designed as multipurpose multiobjective (MPMO), that is, the hardware components can be reconfigured to suit many different and unrelated learning objectives. RL for IoT benefits from certain advantages. First, IoT activities relating to communication often involve devices set apart geographically; running them as part of a single activity in a Web platform is the most efficient way. Second, some IoT activities require an enormous amount of time before conclusions can be made, and such activities are best carried out through an online environment. Using RL to teach students about embedded systems and IoT allows them to access equipment and IoT scenarios beyond their personal space. It is shown that students have been able to undertake the activities using RL successfully.","[Maiti, Ananda; Raza, Ali; Kang, Byeong Ho] Univ Tasmania, Sch Informat & Commun Technol, Launceston, Tas 7250, Australia",University of Tasmania,"Maiti, A (corresponding author), Univ Tasmania, Sch Informat & Commun Technol, Launceston, Tas 7250, Australia.",anandamaiti@live.com; ali.raza@utas.edu.au; Byeong.Kang@utas.edu.au,"Maiti, Ananda/M-3248-2016","Maiti, Ananda/0000-0003-0785-5282; Kang, Byeong Ho/0000-0003-3476-8838",,,,,43,3,3,3,13,IEEE COMPUTER SOC,LOS ALAMITOS,"10662 LOS VAQUEROS CIRCLE, PO BOX 3014, LOS ALAMITOS, CA 90720-1314 USA",1939-1382,,,IEEE T LEARN TECHNOL,IEEE Trans.

In that respect, integrating security-aware processes into design methodologies can lead to products that are more resilient to attacks and provide native protection mechanisms capable of mitigating system vulnerabilities, hence reducing damages and recovery costs. Based on the increasing interest in open-source hardware and relying on the non-proprietary RISC-V specification, in this work we aim to explore architectural extensions serving as a baseline for establishing a Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) in microcontroller-class processor cores targeted at embedded and industrial applications, especially those with some form of latency-sensitive requirements. We point out that supporting a trusted environment in this type of systems is particularly challenging and we identify a minimum set of hardware-level protection mechanisms, with limited assumptions on the available privileged modes and protection support. The reference architecture is demonstrated by extending a lightweight RISC-V core, Ibex. As shown in the last part of our work, the proof-of-concept design achieves flexible support for isolation at a modest overhead in terms of additional hardware resources and delay, thereby fully matching the constraints of latency-sensitive deeply embedded applications.","[Cilardo, Alessandro; Mercogliano, Stefano] Univ Napoli Federico II, Naples, Italy",University of Naples Federico II,"Cilardo, A (corresponding author), Univ Napoli Federico II, Naples, Italy.",acilardo@unina.it; stefano.mercogliano@unina.it,,"Cilardo, Alessandro/0000-0002-1685-8736",Italian Ministry of University and Research (MIUR),"Italian Ministry of University and Research (MIUR)(Ministry of Education, Universities and Research (MIUR))",This work was partly supported by the Italian Ministry of University and Research (MIUR) through the SPHERE project funded within the PRIN-2017 framework.,,40,0,0,0,3,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",0026-2714,1872-941X,,MICROELECTRON RELIAB,Microelectron.

Methods: This study focused on the development of SpO(2) and HR measurements that will allow the monitoring and estimation in real time of the user's state and health related to the established parameters. Measurements were acquired and recorded using a remote web server that recorded the acquired variables for further processing. The statistical analysis data allows comparison of the registered data measured with theoretical models. Results: The IoT model was developed use Bluetooth low-energy devices, which comply with low-cost and open-hardware solutions operated via 'HTTP requests' for data transmission and reception from a cloud server to an edge device. Network performance assessment was conducted to guarantee the availability and integrity of the acquired values and signals. The system measured SpO(2) and HR variables. The most significant result was to achieve energy consumption 20% lower than that of devices in the market.

There remain, however, various challenges with respect to the concept of Industry 4.0 before this new reality is fully integrated into the industrial sector. One such challenge is ensuring security, an essential issue in terms of both management and operational technology involving the configuration and administration of physical equipment. Another is integrating equipment from different manufacturers which must be configured and/or administered with incompatible protocols. Likewise, remote access to systems must be carried out from a browser in the web frame. This paper presents a set of tools, available as a cloud-based service, which facilitates access to the physical equipment located in a business. The access enables the end user to see and/or modify the configuration and management of data in a secure, controlled, organized and collaborative manner. In order to unify different protocols, the service makes use of the Modbus TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol) protocol, one of the most commonly used by industry in local networks. The local Modbus communications are encapsulated in the Websocket protocol to make them accessible from the cloud. The tools proposed in this paper are based on open hardware platforms and free software, and they permit local and remote sensors and actuators to be fully and easily accessed. Hence, their chief advantage is that they allow access from any internet connection, via a browser, to the physical equipment located in an industry by means of user profiles in accordance with the security level set by each individual company.","[Sanchez-Herrera, Reyes; Marquez, Marco A.; Andujar, Jose M.] Huelva Univ, Escuela Tecn Super Ingn, Huelva 21007, Spain",Universidad de Huelva,"Sánchez-Herrera, R (corresponding author), Huelva Univ, Escuela Tecn Super Ingn, Huelva 21007, Spain.",reyes.sanchez@die.uhu.es,"Andujar Marquez, Jose Manuel/L-7056-2014; Sanchez-Herrera, Maria Reyes/F-8951-2016","Andujar Marquez, Jose Manuel/0000-0002-0631-0021; Sanchez-Herrera, Maria Reyes/0000-0003-3099-7262; Marquez, Marco/0000-0003-3780-9965",,,,,44,5,5,1,9,IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC,PISCATAWAY,"445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA",2169-3536,,,IEEE ACCESS,IEEE Access,,2020,8,,,,,,10433,10442,,10.1109/ACCESS.2020.2965639,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2020.2965639,,,10,"Computer Science, Information Systems; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Telecommunications",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Computer Science; Engineering; Telecommunications,LC5XL,,"Green Submitted, gold",,,8/15/24,WOS:000525404800007,,0,2366,,0,H

Open-source printers are a potential platform for the insertion of new materials to the printing palette. However, as-purchased, they are not capable of printing high-temperature polymers. To address this, we developed an open-source-based 3D printer with increased environment controls. These include an enclosure and part heating using infrared energy focused on the printed part to keep it close to the desired temperature, while the printer components stay within their design operating ranges. This enables printing of high-temperature polymers while preventing damage to the machine. The effectiveness of this approach is demonstrated by printing polyetherimide parts (T-g = 217 degrees C). The temperature of the part as well as temperatures at various locations in the build chamber is monitored and assessed. We then evaluate the overall success of the approach by showing the relationship between part temperature and final properties such as surface flaws, tensile strength, and interfacial bonding.","[Gardner, John M.; Stelter, Christopher J.; Sauti, Godfrey; Wincheski, Russell A.; Siochi, Emilie J.] NASA, Adv Mat & Proc Branch, Langley Res Ctr, Hampton, VA 23681 USA; [Gardner, John M.; Schniepp, Hannes C.] William & Mary, Dept Appl Sci, Williamsburg, VA 23185 USA; [Kim, Jae-Woo] Natl Inst Aerosp, Hampton, VA 23666 USA; [Yashin, Edward A.] Univ Michigan, Dearborn, MI 48128 USA",National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA); NASA Langley Research Center; National Institute for Aerospace; University of Michigan System; University of Michigan,"Siochi, EJ (corresponding author), NASA, Adv Mat & Proc Branch, Langley Res Ctr, Hampton, VA 23681 USA.",emilie.j.siochi@nasa.gov,"Kim, Jae-Woo/A-8314-2008; Schniepp, Hannes C./B-8368-2008","Schniepp, Hannes C./0000-0003-4645-9469; Gardner, John/0000-0003-3399-5449",NASA Langley Research Center Internal Research and Development program; NASA Langley Research Center Advanced Air Transport Technology project; National Science Foundation [DMR-EF1534428],NASA Langley Research Center Internal Research and Development program; NASA Langley Research Center Advanced Air Transport Technology project; National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)),s This work was supported by NASA Langley Research Center's Internal Research and Development program and the Advanced Air Transport Technology project.

The question of using renewable energy sources is also essential for the sustainability of wireless sensor networks and the Industrial Internet of Things, especially in scenarios where there is a need to deploy an extensive number of sensor nodes and smart devices in industrial environments. Because of that, this paper targets the problem of monitoring the operations of solar-powered wireless sensor nodes applicable for a variety of Industrial IoT environments, considering their required locations in outdoor scenarios and the efficient solar power harvesting effects. This paper proposes a distributed wireless sensor network system architecture based on open-source hardware and open-source software technologies to achieve that. The proposed architecture is designed for acquiring solar radiation data and other ambient parameters (solar panel and ambient temperature, light intensity, etc.). These data are collected primarily to define estimation techniques using nonlinear regression for predicting solar panel voltage outputs that can be used to achieve energy-efficient operations of solar-powered sensor nodes in outdoor Industrial IoT systems. Additionally, data can be used to analyze and monitor the influence of multiple ambient data on the efficiency of solar panels and, thus, powering sensor nodes. The architecture proposal considers the variety of required data and the transmission and storage of harvested data for further processing. The proposed architecture is implemented in the small-scale variants for evaluation and testing. The platform is further evaluated with the prototype sensor node for collecting solar panel voltage generation data with open-source hardware and low-cost components for designing such data acquisition nodes. The sensor node is evaluated in different scenarios with solar and artificial light conditions for the feasibility of the proposed architecture and justification of its usage. As a result of this research, the platform and the method for implementing estimation techniques for sensor nodes in various sensor and IoT networks, which helps to achieve edge intelligence, is established.","[Dobrilovic, Dalibor; Pekez, Jasmina; Desnica, Eleonora; Radovanovic, Ljiljana; Mazalica, Milica; Djordjevic, Luka; Mihajlovic, Sinisa] Univ Novi Sad, Tech Fac Mihajlo Pupin Zrenjanin, Zrenjanin 23000, Serbia; [Palinkas, Ivan] Tech Coll Appl Sci, Zrenjanin 23000, Serbia",University of Novi Sad,"Pekez, J (corresponding author), Univ Novi Sad, Tech Fac Mihajlo Pupin Zrenjanin, Zrenjanin 23000, Serbia.",dalibor.dobrilovic@tfzr.rs; jasmina.pekez@tfzr.rs; eleonora.desnica@tfzr.rs; ljiljana.radovanovic@tfzr.rs; ivanpalinkas@gmail.com,"Dobrilovic, Dalibor/D-9743-2012; Desnica, Eleonora Z/E-3685-2016; Djordjevic, Luka/JPA-3187-2023","Djordjevic, Luka/0000-0003-4578-9060; Mazalica, Milica/0009-0005-7944-1259; Radovanovic, Ljiljana/0000-0002-5234-4820; Mihajlovic, Sinisa/0000-0003-4456-007X; Pekez, Jasmina/0000-0003-0454-5326","Provincial Secretariat for Higher Education and Scientific Research, Republic of Serbia, Autonomous Province of Vojvodina [142-451-3118/2022-01]","Provincial Secretariat for Higher Education and Scientific Research, Republic of Serbia, Autonomous Province of Vojvodina","The research is conducted through the project ""Creating laboratory conditions for research, development, and education in the field of the use of solar resources in the Internet of Things"" at the Technical Faculty ""Mihajlo Pupin"" Zrenjanin, financed by the Provincial Secretariat for Higher Education and Scientific Research, Republic of Serbia, Autonomous Province of Vojvodina, Project number 142-451-3118/2022-01.",,46,3,3,2,3,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2071-1050,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,30-Apr,2023,15,9,,,,,,,7440,10.3390/su15097440,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su15097440,,,22,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,G1UT2,,gold,,,8/15/24,WOS:000987098300001,,0,2369,,0,H

Nowadays, IEQ monitoring systems are becoming important for several reasons: (1) to ensure that temperature and humidity conditions are adequate, improving the comfort and productivity of the occupants; (2) to introduce actions to reduce energy consumption, contributing to achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG); and (3) to guarantee the quality of the air-a key concern due to the COVID-19 worldwide pandemic. Two kinds of nodes compose the proposed architecture; these are the so-called: (1) smart IEQ sensor nodes, responsible for acquiring indoor environmental measures locally, and (2) the IEQ concentrators, responsible for collecting the data from smart sensor nodes distributed along the facilities. The IEQ concentrators are also responsible for configuring the acquisition system locally, logging the acquired local data, analyzing the information, and connecting to cloud applications. The presented architecture has been designed using low-cost open-source hardware and software-specifically, single board computers and microcontrollers such as Raspberry Pis and Arduino boards. WiFi and TCP/IP communication technologies were selected, since they are typically available in corporative buildings, benefiting from already available communication infrastructures. The application layer was implemented with MQTT. A prototype was built and deployed at the Faculty of Engineering of Vitoria-Gasteiz, University of the Basque Country (UPV/EHU), using the existing network infrastructure. This prototype allowed for collecting data within different academic scenarios.

In this work, we developed a ""do it yourself"" multichannel syringe pump by using easily available low-cost components and microcontrollers, which can be used for educational and/or research purposes in the study of microfluidics and flow chemistry. An Arduino UNO board with CNC shield expansion board and A4988 stepper motor driver is used to control the injection volume and rate of the four syringes. The Arduino-based open-source community minimizes the technical knowledge required to build the system and makes it readily shareable. Detailed fabrication guidelines are provided for the device, which is priced well below commercial alternatives and promotes the development of open hardware for microprocess engineering. The operation of the syringe pump can be controlled by the Arduino IDE or other software through the serial port, which is very beneficial for integration with other devices. Moreover, this multichannel syringe pump is also programmable and can be automatically operated. In order to verify the utility of the platform, we have carried out relevant demonstration experiments of microcapsule preparation for functioning cosmetic product and droplet generation based on microfluidic technique.

To alleviate these difficulties and to develop and share knowledge, the community needs open architecture frameworks for simulation, chip design, and software exploration that support extensibility, scalability, and configurability, alongside an established base of verification tools and supported software. In this article, we present OpenPiton, an open source framework for building scalable architecture research prototypes from one core to 500 million cores. OpenPiton is the world's first open source, general-purpose, multithreaded manycore processor, and framework. OpenPiton is highly configurable, providing a rich design space spanning a variety of hardware parameters that researchers can change. OpenPiton designs can be emulated on FPGA5, where they can run full-stack multiuser Debian Linux. OpenPiton is designed to scale to very large core fabrics, enabling researchers to measure operating system, compiler, and software scalability. The mature code-base reflects the complexity of an industrial-grade design and provides the necessary scripts to build new chips, making OpenPiton a natural choice for computer-aided design (CAD) research. OpenPiton has been validated with a 25-core chip prototype, named Piton, and is bolstered by a validation suite that has thousands of tests, providing an environment to test new hardware designs while verifying the correctness of the whole system. OpenPiton is being actively used in research both internally to Princeton and in the wider community, as well as being adopted in education, industry, and government settings.","[Balkind, Jonathan; McKeown, Michael; Tri Nguyen; Lavrov, Alexey; Shahrad, Mohammad; Fuchs, Adi; Wentzlaff, David] Princeton Univ, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA; [Fu, Yaosheng; Payne, Samuel] NVIDIA, Santa Clara, CA USA; [Zhou, Yanqi] Baidu SVAIL, Sunnyvale, CA USA; [Liang, Xiaohua] Microsoft, Redmond, WA USA; [Matl, Matthew] Univ Calif Berkeley, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA",Princeton University; Nvidia Corporation; Microsoft; University of California System; University of California Berkeley,"Balkind, J (corresponding author), Princeton Univ, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA.",jbalkind@princeton.edu; mmckeown@princeton.edu; yfu@nvidia.com; trin@princeton.edu; zhouyanqi@baidu.com; alavrov@princeton.edu; mshahrad@princeton.edu; adif@princeton.edu; spayne@nvidia.com; xialian@mrosoft.com; mmatl@eecs.berkeley.edu; wentzlaf@princeton.edu,"Shahrad, Mohammad/J-3387-2019","Shahrad, Mohammad/0000-0002-8214-9583","NSF [CNS-1823222, CCF-1217553, CCF-1453112, CCF-1438980]; AFOSR [FA9550-14-1-0148]; Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL); Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) [FA8650-18-2-7846, FA8650-18-2-7852, N66001-14-1-4040, HR0011-13-2-0005]",NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)); AFOSR(United States Department of DefenseAir Force Office of Scientific Research (AFOSR)); Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL)(United States Department of DefenseUS Air Force Research Laboratory); Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA)(United States Department of DefenseDefense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA)),"This material is based on research sponsored by the NSF under Grants No. CNS-1823222, CCF-1217553, CCF-1453112, and CCF-1438980, AFOSR under Grant No. FA9550-14-1-0148, Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) and Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) under agreement No. FA8650-18-2-7846 and FA8650-18-2-7852 and DARPA under Grants No. N66001-14-1-4040 and HR0011-13-2-0005.

Conventional and proprietary clamps are costly and demand access to supply chains for uncommon mechanical components that limit deployment velocity. To overcome these challenges, this study presents new open-source downward-fastened and side-fastened aluminum (Al) framing designs, which are easy to install and compatible with metal and wood racks. The proposed parametric open-source designs are analyzed through finite element method (FEM) simulations and economic analysis is performed to compare to conventional PV frame at both the module and system levels. The FEM results showed all the frames have acceptable mechanical reliability and stability to pass IEC 61215 standards. The results show the new frame (with a bottom width of 29 mm and thickness of 1.5 mm) has about a 2% land use efficiency penalty, but has better mechanical stability (lower stress and deflections), is easier to install, and has reduced material economic costs compared to conventional frames. The results are promising for the use of the new PV frame designs for distributed manufacturing targeted at specific applications.","[Sadat, Seyyed Ali; Pearce, Joshua M.] Western Univ, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, London, ON N6A 3K7, Canada; [Vandewetering, Nicholas] Western Univ, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, London, ON N6A 3K7, Canada; [Pearce, Joshua M.] Western Univ, Ivey Sch Business, London, ON N6A 3K7, Canada",Western University (University of Western Ontario); Western University (University of Western Ontario); Western University (University of Western Ontario),"Pearce, JM (corresponding author), Western Univ, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, London, ON N6A 3K7, Canada.; Pearce, JM (corresponding author), Western Univ, Ivey Sch Business, London, ON N6A 3K7, Canada.",ssadat6@uwo.ca; nvandew@uwo.ca; joshua.pearce@uwo.ca,,"Sadat, Seyyed Ali/0000-0001-9690-4239",Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada; Thompson Endowment; Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC),Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada(Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)CGIAR); Thompson Endowment; Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)(Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)),This research was funded by the Thompson Endowment and the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC).,,82,0,0,1,1,ASME,NEW YORK,"TWO PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10016-5990 USA",0199-6231,1528-8986,,J SOL ENERG-T ASME,J.

A framework, including both software and hardware resources, is necessary to simplify and unify networked access to these devices. In this paper, a set of open-source software tools, specifically designed to cover the different issues concerning the access to sensors and actuators, and two proposed low-cost hardware architectures to operate with the abovementioned software tools are presented. They allow integrated and easy access to local or remote sensors and actuators. The software tools, integrated in the free authoring tool Easy Java and Javascript Simulations (EJS) solve the interaction issues between the subsystem that integrates sensors and actuators into the network, called convergence subsystem in this paper, and the Human Machine Interface (HMI)-this one designed using the intuitive graphical system of EJS-located on the user's computer.

Our aim was to design and test an affordable and easy-to-build noninvasive bilevel pressure ventilator to allow a reduction in the serious shortage of ventilators in LMICs. Methods: The ventilator was built using off-the-shelf materials available via e-commerce and was based on a high-pressure blower, two pressure transducers and an Arduino Nano controller with a digital display (total retail cost <75 USD), with construction details provided open source for free replication. The ventilator was evaluated, and compared with a commercially available device (Lumis 150 ventilator; Resmed, San Diego, CA, USA): 1) in the bench setting using an actively breathing patient simulator mimicking a range of obstructive/restrictive diseases; and b) in 12 healthy volunteers wearing high airway resistance and thoracic/abdominal bands to mimic obstructive/restrictive patients. Results: The designed ventilator provided inspiratory/expiratory pressures up to 20/10 cm H2O, respectively, with no faulty triggering or cycling; both in the bench test and in volunteers. The breathing difficulty score rated (1-10 scale) by the loaded breathing subjects was significantly (p<0.005) decreased from 5.45 +/- 1.68 without support to 2.83 +/- 1.66 when using the prototype ventilator, which showed no difference with the commercial device (2.80 +/- 1.48; p=1.000). Conclusion: The low-cost, easy-to-build noninvasive ventilator performs similarly to a high-quality commercial device, with its open-source hardware description, which will allow for free replication and use in LMICs, facilitating application of this life-saving therapy to patients who otherwise could not be treated.","[Garmendia, Onintza; Rodriguez-Lazaro, Miguel A.; Otero, Jorge; Navajas, Daniel; Farre, Ramon] Univ Barcelona, Fac Med & Ciencies Salut, Unitat Biofis & Bioengn, Barcelona, Spain; [Garmendia, Onintza; Montserrat, Josep M.] Univ Barcelona, Hosp Clin, Sleep Lab, Barcelona, Spain; [Otero, Jorge; Navajas, Daniel; Montserrat, Josep M.; Farre, Ramon] CIBER Enfermedades Resp, Madrid, Spain; [Phuong Phan] Hue Cent Hosp, Hue, Vietnam; [Stoyanova, Alexandrina] Univ Barcelona, Fac Econ & Business, Dept Econ, Barcelona, Spain; [Anh Tuan Dinh-Xuan] Hop Cochin, AP HP, Serv Physiol Explorat Fonct, Paris, France; [Gozal, David] Univ Missouri, Dept Child Hlth, Sch Med, Columbia, MO 65201 USA; [Navajas, Daniel] Barcelona Inst Sci & Technol, Inst Bioengn Catalonia IBEC, Barcelona, Spain; [Montserrat, Josep M.; Farre, Ramon] Inst Invest Biomed August Pi Sunyer, Barcelona, Spain",University of Barcelona; University of Barcelona; Hospital Clinic de Barcelona; CIBER - Centro de Investigacion Biomedica en Red; CIBERES; University of Barcelona; Assistance Publique Hopitaux Paris (APHP); Universite Paris Cite; Hopital Universitaire Cochin - APHP; University of Missouri System; University of Missouri Columbia; University of Barcelona; Barcelona Institute of Science & Technology; Institut de Bioenginyeria de Catalunya; University of Barcelona; Hospital Clinic de Barcelona; IDIBAPS,"Farré, R (corresponding author), Fac Med & Ciencies Salut, Unitat Biofis & Bioengn, Casanova 143, Barcelona 08036, Spain.",,"Navajas, Daniel/E-4233-2010; Gozal, David/ABH-3805-2020; DINH-XUAN, Anh Tuan/A-9691-2008; Farre, Ramon/L-2664-2017","Navajas, Daniel/0000-0001-7150-9363; DINH-XUAN, Anh Tuan/0000-0001-8651-5176; Farre, Ramon/0000-0002-9084-7824; Petrova Stoyanova, Alexandrina/0000-0003-3238-0055; Gozal, David/0000-0001-8195-6036",,,,,37,43,47,0,8,EUROPEAN RESPIRATORY SOC JOURNALS LTD,SHEFFIELD,"442 GLOSSOP RD, SHEFFIELD S10 2PX, ENGLAND",0903-1936,1399-3003,,EUR RESPIR J,Eur.

In the last two decades, their applications to industrial instruments, vehicles, and household appliances have reached the extent that microcontrollers are now the number-one selling electronic chip of all kinds. Simultaneously, the field of lab-on-a-chip research and technology has seen major technological leaps towards sample handling, sample preparation, and sensing for use in molecular diagnostic devices. Yet, the transformation from a laboratory based lab-on-a-chip technology to actual point-of-care device products has largely been limited to a fraction of the foreseen potential. We believe that increased knowledge of the vast possibilities that becomes available with open source microcontrollers, especially when embedded in easy-to-use development environments, such as the Arduino or Raspberry Pi, could potentially solve and even bridge the gap between lab-on-a-chip technology and real-life point of care applications. The profuse availability and extraordinary capabilities of microcontrollers, namely within computation, communication, and networking, combined with easy-to-use development environments, as well as a very active and fast moving community of makers, who are eager to share their knowledge, could potentially be the difference between a dreadful chip-in-a-lab-situation, and the next successful start-up. Here follows a brief insight into how open source microcontrollers could potentially have a transformative effect on the field of lab-on-a-chip research and technology.

One area that requires improved supply chain resilience and that is of particular importance to electronic designers is the shortage of basic dual in-line package (DIP) electronic components commonly used for prototyping. This anecdotal observation was investigated as a case study of using additive manufacturing to enforce contact between premade, off-the-shelf conductors to allow for electrical continuity between two arbitrary points by examining data relating to the stock quantity of electronic components, extracted from Digi-Key Electronics. This study applies this concept using an open hardware approach for the design, testing, and use of a simple, parametric, 3-D printable invention that allows for small outline integrated circuit (SOIC) components to be used in DIP package circuits (i.e., breadboards, protoboards, etc.). The additive manufacture breakout board (AMBB) design was developed using two different open-source modelers, OpenSCAD and FreeCAD, to provide reliable and consistent electrical contact between the component and the rest of the circuit and was demonstrated with reusable 8-SOIC to DIP breakout adapters. The three-part design was optimized for manufacturing with RepRap-class fused filament 3-D printers, making the AMBB a prime candidate for use in distributed manufacturing models. The AMBB offers increased flexibility during circuit prototyping by allowing arbitrary connections between the component and prototyping interface as well as superior organization through the ability to color-code different component types. The cost of the AMBB is CAD $0.066/unit, which is a 94% saving compared to conventional PCB-based breakout boards. Use of the AMBB device can provide electronics designers with an increased selection of components for through-hole use by more than a factor of seven. Future development of AMBB devices to allow for low-cost conversion between arbitrary package types provides a path towards more accessible and inclusive electronics design as well as faster prototyping and technical innovation.","[Brooks, Cameron K.; Pearce, Joshua M.] Western Univ, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, London, ON N6A 5B9, Canada; [Peplinski, Jack E.; Pearce, Joshua M.] Western Univ, Ivey Business Sch, London, ON N6A 5B9, Canada",Western University (University of Western Ontario); Western University (University of Western Ontario),"Pearce, JM (corresponding author), Western Univ, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, London, ON N6A 5B9, Canada.; Pearce, JM (corresponding author), Western Univ, Ivey Business Sch, London, ON N6A 5B9, Canada.",cbrook49@uwo.ca; jpeplin2@uwo.ca; joshua.pearce@uwo.ca,"; Pearce, Joshua/C-9240-2013","Brooks, Cameron/0000-0002-1275-3267; Pearce, Joshua/0000-0001-9802-3056; Peplinski, Jack Edward/0000-0003-4169-3643",,,,,70,0,0,1,2,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2411-5134,,INVENTIONS-BASEL,Inventions,APR,2023,8,2,,,,,,,61,10.3390/inventions8020061,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/inventions8020061,,,15,"Engineering, Multidisciplinary",Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI),Engineering,E9CE8,,gold,,,8/15/24,WOS:000978429200001,,0,2382,,0,H

Proximity data acquisition usually depends on a hardware solution to which some sensors can be coupled, managed by a software that may (or may not) store, process and send acquired data to a back-end using some communication protocol. The sheer number of both proprietary and open hardware solutions, together with the diversity and characteristics of available sensors, is enough to deem the task of designing a data acquisition device complex. Factoring in the harsh operational context, the multiple DIY solutions presented by an active online community, available in-field power approaches and the different communication protocols, each proximity monitoring solution can be regarded as singular. Data acquisition devices should be increasingly flexible, not only by supporting a large number of heterogeneous sensors, but also by being able to resort to different communication protocols, depending on both the operational and functional contexts in which they are deployed. Furthermore, these small and unattended devices need to be sufficiently robust and cost-effective to allow greater in-field measurement granularity 365 days/year. This paper presents a low-cost, flexible and robust data acquisition device that can be deployed in different operational contexts, as it also supports three different communication technologies: IEEE 802.15.4/ZigBee, LoRa/LoRaWAN and GRPS.

These sensors, smart electrical appliances, and other IoT devices connect to the Internet through a home gateway. This paper lays out an architecture for a cost-effective smart door sensor that will inform a user through an Android application, of door open events in a house or office environment. The proposed architecture uses an Arduino-compatible Elegoo Mega 2560 microcontroller board along with the Raspberry Pi 2 board for communicating with a web server that implements a RESTful API. Several programming languages are used in the implementation and further applications of the door sensor are discussed as well as some of its shortcomings such as possible interference from other radio frequency devices.

In the fields of materials science and mechanical engineering, fundamental equipment such as tensile testing devices can cost tens to hundreds of thousands of dollars. While a research lab often has access to a large-scale testing machine suitable for conventional samples, loading devices for meso-and micro-scale samples for in-situ testing with the myriad of microscopy tools are often hard to source and cost prohibitive. Open-source software has allowed for great strides in the reduction of costs associated with software development and open-source hardware and additive manufacturing have the potential to similarly reduce the costs of scientific equipment and increase the accessibility of scientific research. To investigate the feasibility of open-source hardware, a micro-tensile tester was designed with a freely accessible computer-aided design package and manufactured with a desktop 3D-printer and off-the-shelf components. To our knowledge this is one of the first demonstrations of a tensile tester with additively manufactured components for scientific research. The capabilities of the tensile tester were demonstrated by investigating the mechanical properties of Graphene Oxide (GO) paper and thin films. A 3D printed tensile tester was successfully used in conjunction with an atomic force microscope to provide one of the first quantitative measurements of GO thin film buckling under compression. The tensile tester was also used in conjunction with an atomic force microscope to observe the change in surface topology of a GO paper in response to increasing tensile strain. No significant change in surface topology was observed in contrast to prior hypotheses from the literature. Based on this result obtained with the new open source tensile stage we propose an alternative hypothesis we term 'superlamellae consolidation' to explain the initial deformation of GO paper. The additively manufactured tensile tester tested represents cost savings of > 99% compared to commercial solutions in its class and offers simple customization. However, continued development is needed for the tensile tester presented here to approach the technical specifications achievable with commercial solutions.","[Nandy, Krishanu; Collinson, David W.; Scheftic, Charlie M.; Brinson, L.

However, entering this field of research is difficult since such an implant requires components from many different areas of technology. Since the complete avoidance of wires is important due to the risk of infections and other long-term problems, means for wirelessly transmitting data and energy are a necessity which adds to the requirements. In recent literature, many high-tech components for such implants are presented with remarkable properties. However, these components are typically not freely available for such a system. Every group needs to re-develop their own solution. This raises the question if it is possible to create a reusable design for an implant and its external base-station, such that it allows other groups to use it as a starting point. In this article, we try to answer this question by presenting a design based exclusively on commercial off-the-shelf components and studying the properties of the resulting system. Following this idea, we present a fully wireless neuronal implant for simultaneously measuring electrocorticography signals at 128 locations from the surface of the brain.

To achieve truly wireless operation, today's IoT devices largely depend on batteries for power. However, this leads to high maintenance costs due to battery replacement, or the environmentally damaging concept of disposable devices. Energy harvesting has emerged as a promising approach to delivering long-life, environmentally friendly IoT device operation. However, with the exception of solar harvesting, it remains difficult to ensure sustainable system operation using environmental power alone. This paper tackles this problem by contributing Static, a Radio Frequency (RF) energy harvesting and wireless power transfer platform. Our approach comprises autonomous energy management techniques, adaptive power transfer algorithms and an open-source hardware reference platform to enable further research. We evaluate Static in laboratory conditions and show that 1) ambient RF energy harvesting can deliver sustainable operation using common industrial sources, while 2) wireless power transfer provides a simple means to power motes at a range of up to 3 m through a variety of media.","[Thangarajan, Ashok Samraj; Nguyen, Thien Duc; Liu, Mengyao; Michiels, Sam; Joosen, Wouter; Hughes, Danny] Katholieke Univ Leuven, Imec DistriNet Comp Sci, Leuven, Belgium; [Yang, Fan] Bosch, Res Intelligent IoT & Comp X, Shanghai, Peoples R China; [Man, Ka Lok; Ma, Jieming] XiAnjiaotong Liverpool Univ, CSSE, Xian, Peoples R China",KU Leuven; Xi'an Jiaotong-Liverpool University,"Thangarajan, AS (corresponding author), Katholieke Univ Leuven, Imec DistriNet Comp Sci, Leuven, Belgium.",ashoksamraj.thangarajan@kuleuven.be,"Ma, Jieming/U-3275-2019; Nguyen, Thien/F-5283-2018","Michiels, Sam/0000-0002-3866-5425; Nguyen, Thien/0000-0002-8889-0903","This research is partially supported by imec and Flanders Innovation amp;amp; Entrepreneurship, the research fund at KU Leuven, the SL-Cluster project at XJTLU and the ICON-WiPer project.; imec and Flanders Innovation amp;amp; Entrepreneurship; SL-Cluster project at XJTLU","This research is partially supported by imec and Flanders Innovation amp;amp; Entrepreneurship, the research fund at KU Leuven, the SL-Cluster project at XJTLU and the ICON-WiPer project.; imec and Flanders Innovation amp;amp; Entrepreneurship; SL-Cluster project at XJTLU","This research is partially supported by imec and Flanders Innovation & amp; Entrepreneurship, the research fund at KU Leuven, the SL-Cluster project at XJTLU and the ICON-WiPer project.",,40,1,1,0,0,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,LAUSANNE,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",,2673-8198,,FRONT SIGNAL PROC-SW,Front.

A threat plaguing these systems consists of software vulnerabilities that cause memory corruption, potentially allowing an attacker to breach the device. Software-based countermeasures exist, but suffer from high overhead. In this survey, we investigate whether this could be mitigated using dedicated hardware. Driven by the advancements of open hardware, we focus on implementations for RISC-V, a novel and open architecture tailored for customization. We distinguish between methods validating memory accesses beforehand, obfuscating information necessary for an attack, and detecting memory values corrupted earlier. We compare on qualitative metrics, such as the security coverage and level of transparency, and performance in both software and hardware. Although current implementations do not easily allow for a fair comparison as their evaluation methodologies vary widely, we show that current implementations are suitable to minimize the runtime overhead with a relatively small area overhead. Nevertheless, we identified that further research is still required to mitigate more fine-grained attacks such as intra-object overflows, to integrate into more sophisticated protected execution environments towards resilient systems that are automatically recoverable, and to move towards more harmonized evaluation.","[Brohet, Marco; Regazzoni, Francesco] Univ Amsterdam, Sci Pk 900, NL-1098 XH Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Regazzoni, Francesco] Univ Svizzera Italiana, ALaRi, Via Santa 1, CH-6962 Lugano, Switzerland",University of Amsterdam; Universita della Svizzera Italiana,"Brohet, M (corresponding author), Univ Amsterdam, Sci Pk 900, NL-1098 XH Amsterdam, Netherlands.",m.j.a.brohet@uva.nl; f.regazzoni@uva.nl,,"Brohet, M.J.A./0000-0002-0860-9107; Regazzoni, Francesco/0000-0001-6385-0780",,,,,83,0,0,2,2,ASSOC COMPUTING MACHINERY,NEW YORK,"1601 Broadway, 10th Floor, NEW YORK, NY USA",0360-0300,1557-7341,,ACM COMPUT SURV,ACM Comput.

One of the key strengths of Arduino is the possibility it affords of loading the script into the board's memory and letting it run without interfacing with computers, thus granting complete independence, portability and accuracy. Recent works have demonstrated that the cost of scientific equipment can be reduced by applying open-source principles to their design using a combination of the Arduino platform and a 3D printer. The evolution of the 3D printer has provided a new means of open design capable of accelerating self-directed development. The proposed nano Environmental Monitoring System (nEMoS) instrument is shown to have good reliability and it provides the foundation for a more critical approach to the use of professional sensors as well as for conceiving new scenarios and potential applications.","[Salamone, Francesco; Belussi, Lorenzo; Danza, Ludovico; Ghellere, Matteo; Meroni, Italo] Natl Res Council Italy ITC CNR, Construct Technol Inst, I-20098 San Giuliano Milanese, MI, Italy",Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche (CNR); Istituto per le Tecnologie della Costruzione (ITC-CNR),"Salamone, F (corresponding author), Natl Res Council Italy ITC CNR, Construct Technol Inst, Via Lombardia 49, I-20098 San Giuliano Milanese, MI, Italy.",salamone@itc.cnr.it; belussi@itc.cnr.it; danza@itc.cnr.it; ghellere@itc.cnr.it; meroni@itc.cnr.it,"Danza, Ludovico/B-6954-2015; Belussi, Lorenzo/C-7504-2017; Danza, Ludovico/AAW-3770-2020; Salamone, Francesco/O-4213-2015","Danza, Ludovico/0000-0003-3305-4008; Belussi, Lorenzo/0000-0002-1341-0602; Danza, Ludovico/0000-0003-3305-4008; Salamone, Francesco/0000-0003-3215-3979; Ghellere, Matteo/0000-0001-8448-3705",Lombardy Region; National Research Council of Italy (CNR),Lombardy Region(Regione Lombardia); National Research Council of Italy (CNR)(Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche (CNR)),This work has been supported within the Framework Agreement between the Lombardy Region and National Research Council of Italy (CNR).,,22,45,49,4,61,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,1424-8220,,SENSORS-BASEL,Sensors,JUN,2015,15,6,,,,,13012,13027,,10.3390/s150613012,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/s150613012,,,16,"Chemistry, Analytical; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Instruments & Instrumentation",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Chemistry; Engineering; Instruments & Instrumentation,CM7JX,26053749,"Green Published, gold, Green Submitted",,,8/15/24,WOS:000357869200050,,0,2395,,0,H

Thus, assuring human health and food production requires efficient strategies and technologies for environmental protection. Knowing key parameters such as soil moisture, air, and water quality is essential for smart farming and urban development. The MeteoMex project aims to build simple hardware kits and their integration into current Internet-of-Things (IoT) platforms. This paper shows the use of low-end Wemos D1 mini boards to connect environmental sensors to the open-source platform ThingsBoard. Two printed circuit boards (PCB) were designed for mounting components. Analog, digital and (IC)-C-2 sensors are supported. The Wemos ESP8266 microchip provides WiFi capability and can be programed with the Arduino IDE. Application examples for the MeteoMex aeria and terra kits demonstrate their functionality for air quality, soil, and climate monitoring. Further, a prototype for monitoring wastewater treatment is shown, which exemplifies the capabilities of the Wemos board for signal processing. The data are stored in a PostgreSQL database, which enables data mining. The MeteoMex IoT system is highly scalable and of low cost, which makes it suitable for deployment in agriculture 4.0, industries, and public areas.

The platform includes sensors to measure turbidity, total dissolved solids (TDS), and water temperature as variables that are often collected to assess water quality. The design is extensible for research and monitoring purposes, and all the design files are provided under open-source permissive licenses for further development. System design and operation are discussed for illustrative purposes. A block diagram indicates elements of mechanical, electrical, and software design for this system. The mechanical assembly used to house circuit boards and sensors is designed using 3D printing for rapid prototyping. The electronic circuit board acts as a carrier for an Arduino 32-bit microcontroller board and an associated cellular module along with a GPS for geolocation of water quality measurements. The cellular module permits data transfer for Internet of Things (IoT) functionality. System operation is set up using a command line interface (CLI) and C + + code that allows for calibration coefficients and human-readable transfer functions to be defined so that sensor voltages are related to physical quantities. Data are cached on a secure digital (SD) card for backup. The circuit was calibrated, and system operation assessed by deployment on an urban reservoir. Biogeochemical cycles were identified in the collected data using spectrogram and semivariogram analyses to validate system operation. As a system with hardware and software released under an open source license, the WaterWatcher platform reduces the time and effort required to build and deploy low-cost water quality measurement sensors and provides an example of the basic hardware design that can be used for measurements of water quality.","[Kinar, N.

This current practice of releasing water from reservoirs causes flash floods in downstream areas and increases the likelihood of dam failures and public outrage. Pre-release of water from reservoirs is therefore an important strategy for downstream flood mitigation. Hydrological models can simulate river flow with sufficient lead time. Thus, the resulting outputs can be effectively applied to pre-release decision making in the reservoirs. Since the beginning of computer-aided applications, many attempts have been made to establish a decision support system for reservoir flood control. However, this is hampered by manual stations, low quality data, high cost of software and data, unknown parameter values, and lack of expertise, especially in developing countries. Therefore, a total open-source solution combined with low-cost open-source hardware, free and open-source software, and open standards was seen as the only way to overcome reservoir-related flood risk. Moreover, research studies on open-source hardware, software, standards, and data are limited to a few case studies reporting real-time data on certain environmental parameters. Therefore, the application of integrated open-source technologies for reservoir flood control remains an unexplored area. In this background, a hydrological model powered by integrated open-source technology is presented in this research for reservoir pre-release decision making. The model was tested for the Deduru Oya watershed using the SWAT (Soil and Water Assessment Tool) toolkit. The calibration results appear to be satisfactory for both daily and hourly time intervals. Thus, this model helps to simulate the inflow of the reservoir and determine the level of reservoir gate opening.","[Warusavitharana, E.; Mahanama, P. K. S.; Ratnayake, R.; Sudantha, B.

This study develops a distributed manufacturing solution using only an open source manufacturing tool chain consisting of two types of open source 3-D printing and batch UV curing, and provides a parametric fully free design of a nasopharyngeal swab. The swab was designed using parametric OpenSCAD in two components (a head with engineered break point and various handles), which has several advantages: i) minimizing print time on relatively slow SLA printers, ii) enabling the use of smaller print volume open source SLA printers, iii) reducing the amount of relatively expensive UV resin, and iv) enabling production of handle on more accessible material extrusion 3-D printers. A modular open source UV LED box was designed, fabricated for $45 and tested for batch curing. Swabs can be fabricated for $0.06-$0.12/swab. The results of the mechanical validation tests showed that the swabs could withstand greater forces than would be expected in normal clinical use. The swabs were also able to absorb a significant amounts of synthetic mucus materials and passed abrasion and handling tests. The results show the open source swab are promising candidates for clinical trials. (C) 2020 The Author(s).

In robotics, it is pertinent to think that modular construction is essential, due to the complexity of geometry in each of the pieces and their manufacture. Taking into account the globalization of information and the worldwide reproduction of databases, facilitating access to CAD files to be reproduced in 3D printing promotes the easy construction of archived mechanical designs. A robotic architecture becomes a complex assembly by having multiple operating systems. The sensorics, mechanics, electronics and programming that it requires for navigation, collaboration, development, operation and even industrial manufacturing means that more and more elaborate embedded systems are used. In this work, a mobile robotics architecture was developed with a sensory system that allows free movement and navigation in closed loop inverse kinematics. This kind of robot uses navigation algorithms to take a trajectory in collaborative closed environments, that is, closed industrial environments where obstacles are normally immovable and corridors to move narrow, in addition to having mobile obstacles like humans.

Drifters that can be tracked in real time have so far been rather expensive. Recently, due to the rise of the open-hardware revolution and the associated Arduino ecosystem, both GPS receivers and cellular modems have become available at lower prices to ""tinkering scientists"", i.e., scientists that like to build their own measurement devices as much as is possible. This article serves two goals. Firstly, we provide detailed instructions on how to build a low-power GPS drifter with local storage and cellular model that we tested in a fieldwork on the confluence of the Chindwin and Ayeyarwady rivers in Myanmar. The device was designed from easily connected off-the-shelf components, allowing construction without a background in electrical engineering. The instructions allow fellow geoscientists to recreate the device. Secondly, we set the following question: has the open-hardware revolution progressed to the point that a low-power GPS drifter that wirelessly transmits its position can be made from open-hardware components by most geoscientists?. We feel this question is relevant and timely as more low-cost open-hardware devices are promoted, but in practice applicability is often restricted to the ""tinkering engineer"". We argue that because of the plug-and-play nature of the components geoscientists should be able to construct these type of devices. However, to get such devices to operate at low power levels that fieldwork often demands requires detailed (micro)electrical expertise.","[Hut, Rolf] Delft Univ Technol, Fac Civil Engn & Geosci, Chair Water Resources Engn, NL-2628 CH Delft, Netherlands; [Win, Thanda Thatoe Nwe; Bogaard, Thom] Delft Univ Technol, Fac Civil Engn & Geosci, Chair Hydrol, NL-2628 CH Delft, Netherlands",Delft University of Technology; Delft University of Technology,"Hut, R (corresponding author), Delft Univ Technol, Fac Civil Engn & Geosci, Chair Water Resources Engn, NL-2628 CH Delft, Netherlands.",r.w.hut@tudelft.nl,"; Hut, Rolf/O-3344-2013","Bogaard, Thom/0000-0002-1325-024X; Hut, Rolf/0000-0002-5697-5697",[NICHE-NMR-250],,This research has been supported by VPDelta and NICHE-NMR-250 projects.,,22,1,1,0,2,COPERNICUS GESELLSCHAFT MBH,GOTTINGEN,"BAHNHOFSALLEE 1E, GOTTINGEN, 37081, GERMANY",2193-0856,2193-0864,,GEOSCI INSTRUM METH,Geosci.

In this study, we describe an imaging system that integrates low-cost and open-source hardware, software and genetic resources. The multi-fluorescence imaging system consists of readily available 470 nm LEDs, a Raspberry Pi camera and a set of filters made with low cost acrylics. This device allows imaging in scales ranging from single colonies to entire plates. We developed a set of genetic components (e.g. promoters, coding sequences, terminators) and vectors following the standard framework of Golden Gate, which allowed the fabrication of genetic constructs in a combinatorial, low cost and robust manner. In order to provide simultaneous imaging of multiple wavelength signals, we screened a series of long stokes shift fluorescent proteins that could be combined with cyan/green fluorescent proteins. We found CyOFP1, mBeRFP and sfGFP to be the most compatible set for 3-channel fluorescent imaging. We developed open source Python code to operate the hardware to run time-lapse experiments with automated control of illumination and camera and a Python module to analyze data and extract meaningful biological information. To demonstrate the potential application of this integral system, we tested its performance on a diverse range of imaging assays often used in disciplines such as microbial ecology, microbiology and synthetic biology. We also assessed its potential use in a high school environment to teach biology, hardware design, optics, and programming. Together, these results demonstrate the successful integration of open source hardware, software, genetic resources and customizable manufacturing to obtain a powerful, low cost and robust system for education, scientific research and bioengineering.

In swarm robotics, groups of robots collaborate using local interactions and collectively solve tasks beyond an individual robot's capabilities. Individual robots must have onboard processing, communication, and sensing capabilities to autonomously react to their neighbors and immediate environment. Most research involving UAVs in swarm robotics presents only simulation results, while key landmark studies with real UAV swarms have used UAV platforms that were custom-built for the respective study. One important reason for this is that no commercial UAV platform comes pre-equipped with the ability to identify and track the positions and poses of nearby drones using only onboard sensors and computation, and in research platforms, the relevant sensing technologies are currently under development. Our aim is to provide a platform that allows swarm robotics researchers to test their algorithms on real UAVs, without having to develop their own custom-built UAVs or to wait until more advanced sensing technology is ready off-the-shelf. We provide a well-documented, entirely open-source UAV platform- S-drone (Swarm-drone)-to foster and support UAV swarm research in a laboratory environment. The S-drone uses fiducial markers in the environment and cooperative feature-level sensor fusion for inter-robot tracking to track the presence, identity, relative 2D position, and relative 2D orientation of neighboring peers. The S-drone is suitable for a wide range of contexts, supports quad-camera vision-based navigation and a variety of onboard sensing, and is extensible. It is especially suited for swarm robotics research because it can operate using strictly onboard processing and sensing without the need for global positioning systems, motion capture systems, or ground stations for off-board sensing.","[Oguz, Sinan; Heinrich, Mary Katherine; Allwright, Michael; Zhu, Weixu; Wahby, Mostafa; Dorigo, Marco] Univ Libre Bruxelles ULB, Inst Rech Interdisciplinaires & Dev Intelligence A, B-1050 Brussels, Belgium; [Oguz, Sinan; Garone, Emanuele] Univ Libre Bruxelles ULB, Unite Enseignement Automat & Anal Syst SAAS, B-1050 Brussels, Belgium",Universite Libre de Bruxelles; Universite Libre de Bruxelles,"Oguz, S (corresponding author), Univ Libre Bruxelles ULB, Inst Rech Interdisciplinaires & Dev Intelligence A, B-1050 Brussels, Belgium.; Oguz, S (corresponding author), Univ Libre Bruxelles ULB, Unite Enseignement Automat & Anal Syst SAAS, B-1050 Brussels, Belgium.",sinan.oguz@ulb.be,"; Dorigo, Marco/B-5664-2013","Garone, Emanuele/0000-0003-0419-8483; Dorigo, Marco/0000-0002-3971-0507; OGUZ, Sinan/0000-0003-2832-1239",Program of Concerted Research Actions (ARC) of the Universit libre de Bruxelles,Program of Concerted Research Actions (ARC) of the Universit libre de Bruxelles,No Statement Available,,24,0,0,3,3,IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC,PISCATAWAY,"445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA",2169-3536,,,IEEE ACCESS,IEEE Access,,2024,12,,,,,,43378,43395,,10.1109/ACCESS.2024.3378607,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2024.3378607,,,18,"Computer Science, Information Systems; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Telecommunications",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Computer Science; Engineering; Telecommunications,MF5Z9,,gold,,,8/15/24,WOS:001192238400001,,0,2408,,0,H

However, their main drawback is the high cost, which makes it almost impossible for schools to have one robot per student. Another drawback is the proprietary nature of commercial solutions, which limits the ability to expand or adapt the robot to educational needs. Different robot kit versions, which have different electronics and programming interfaces and target different age groups, make the decision of educators on which robot to use in STEM education even more complicated. In this work, we propose a new low-cost 3D-printable and unified software-based solution that can cover the needs of all age groups, from kindergarten children to university students. The solution is driven by open source and open hardware ideas, with which, we believe we will help educators in their work. We provide detail on the 3D-printable robot parts and its list of electronics that allow for a wide range of educational activities to be supported, and explain its flexible software stack that supports four different operating modes. The modes cover the needs of users that do not know or want to program the robot, users that prefer block-based programming and less or more experienced programmers who want to take full control of the robot. The robot implements the principles of continuous integration and deployment and allows for easy updates to the latest software version through its web-based administration panel. Though, in its first steps of development and testing, the proposed robot has a huge potential, due to its open nature and the community of students, researchers and educators, that potential has kept growing. A pilot at selected schools, a performance evaluation of various technical aspects and a comparison with state-of-the-art platforms will soon follow.","[Chronis, Christos; Varlamis, Iraklis] Harokopio Univ Athens, Dept Informat & Telemat, Omirou 9, Athens 17778, Greece",Harokopio University Athens,"Varlamis, I (corresponding author), Harokopio Univ Athens, Dept Informat & Telemat, Omirou 9, Athens 17778, Greece.",chronis@hua.gr; varlamis@hua.gr,"; Varlamis, Iraklis/Q-9191-2018","Chronis, Christos/0000-0002-2768-7119; Varlamis, Iraklis/0000-0002-0876-8167",Harokopio University of Athens,Harokopio University of Athens,"The authors would like to thank the students from Harokopio University of Athens who supported the development and assembly of FOSSBot so far: Eleftheria Papageorgiou, Thanassis Apostolidis, Dimitris Charitos, Giorgos Kazazis.

When motor actuators were used for robot development in the past, it was difficult to find cost-effective commercial products. Open-source motor controllers, recently developed with the collaboration of many people, have exhibited phenomenal growth as their performance is now comparable to those of commercial products and their price is cheaper. In this study, we utilized an open-source Vedder electronic speed controller (VESC), originally developed for electric skateboards, as a general-purpose motor controller for robot control. The high-speed, high-torque, and high-output VESC was hardware-upgraded to enable more accurate current control, and advanced position and speed control algorithms were developed to produce Myongji-VESC (MJ-VESC), a general-purpose motor controller for multiaxis robot systems. To evaluate its current, speed, and position control performances, MJ-VESC was applied to an open-source planetary geared actuator that can be fabricated with a 3D printer. Based on this, we propose an open-source motor controller framework that can be universally used for multiaxis robot systems.","[Choi, Dongil] Myongji Univ, Dept Mech Engn, Seoul 17058, South Korea",Myongji University,"Choi, DL (corresponding author), Myongji Univ, Dept Mech Engn, Seoul 17058, South Korea.",dongilc@mju.ac.kr,"Choi, Dongil/AAJ-3827-2020","Choi, Dongil/0000-0002-0566-2922",National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) - Korea government (MSIT) [2019R1G1A1008726]; 2018 Research Fund of Myongji University; National Research Foundation of Korea; Myongji University,"National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) - Korea government (MSIT)(National Research Foundation of KoreaMinistry of Science, ICT & Future Planning, Republic of KoreaMinistry of Science & ICT (MSIT), Republic of Korea); 2018 Research Fund of Myongji University; National Research Foundation of Korea(National Research Foundation of Korea); Myongji University","This work was supported in part by the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) grant funded by the Korea government (MSIT) (No. 2019R1G1A1008726), and in part by the 2018 Research Fund of Myongji University. 10.13039/501100003725-National Research Foundation of Korea and 10.13039/501100002538-Myongji University.",,32,4,4,0,11,IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC,PISCATAWAY,"445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA",2169-3536,,,IEEE ACCESS,IEEE Access,,2020,8,,,,,,14134,14145,,10.1109/ACCESS.2020.2965977,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2020.2965977,,,12,"Computer Science, Information Systems; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Telecommunications",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Computer Science; Engineering; Telecommunications,LB6HQ,,gold,,,8/15/24,WOS:000524735300013,,0,2412,,0,H

A versatile and standardized platform is needed to accelerate research and let practitioners focus on the core problems. To this end, we present Agilicious, a codesigned hardware and software framework tailored to autonomous, agile quadrotor flight. It is completely open source and open hardware and supports both model-based and neural network-based controllers. Also, it provides high thrust-to-weight and torque-to-inertia ratios for agility, onboard vision sensors, graphics processing unit (GPU)-accelerated compute hardware for real-time perception and neural network inference, a real-time flight controller, and a versatile software stack. In contrast to existing frameworks, Agilicious offers a unique combination of flexible software stack and high-performance hardware. We compare Agilicious with prior works and demonstrate it on different agile tasks, using both model-based and neural network-based controllers. Our demonstrators include trajectory tracking at up to 5g and 70 kilometers per hour in a motion capture system, and vision-based acrobatic flight and obstacle avoidance in both structured and unstructured environments using solely onboard perception. Last, we demonstrate its use for hardware-in-the-loop simulation in virtual reality environments. Because of its versatility, we believe that Agilicious supports the next generation of scientific and industrial quadrotor research.","[Foehn, Philipp; Kaufmann, Elia; Romero, Angel; Penicka, Robert; Sun, Sihao; Bauersfeld, Leonard; Laengle, Thomas; Cioffi, Giovanni; Song, Yunlong; Loquercio, Antonio; Scaramuzza, Davide] Univ Zurich, Dept Informat, Zurich, Switzerland",University of Zurich,"Foehn, P (corresponding author), Univ Zurich, Dept Informat, Zurich, Switzerland.",foehn@ifi.uzh.ch,"Pěnička, Robert/AAC-4673-2019","Pěnička, Robert/0000-0001-8549-4932; Foehn, Philipp/0000-0001-9585-1278; Scaramuzza, Davide/0000-0002-3831-6778; Bauersfeld, Leonard/0000-0002-5790-9982; Sun, Sihao/0000-0002-8539-3979; Cioffi, Giovanni/0000-0003-3964-8552; Kaufmann, Elia/0000-0001-6094-5901; Song, Yunlong/0000-0002-6352-3744; Romero Aguilar, Angel/0000-0002-7977-7802; Laengle, Thomas/0000-0002-8551-0370",National Centre of Competence in Research (NCCR) Robotics through the Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF); European Union [871479]; European Research Council (ERC) [864042]; European Research Council (ERC) [864042] Funding Source: European Research Council (ERC),National Centre of Competence in Research (NCCR) Robotics through the Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF)(Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF)); European Union(European Union (EU)); European Research Council (ERC)(European Research Council (ERC)); European Research Council (ERC)(European Research Council (ERC)),"This work was supported by the National Centre of Competence in Research (NCCR) Robotics through the Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF) and the European Union's Horizon 2020 Research and Innovation Program under grant agreement no. 871479 (AERIAL-CORE) and the European Research Council (ERC) under grant agreement no. 864042 (AGILEFLIGHT).

Therefore, suitable methods for the assessment of simulator sickness are required. The main aim of this paper was to present a non-invasive method for assessing simulator sickness by recording gastric myoelectrical activity-electrogastrography. Open-source hardware for electrogastrography together with recordings obtained in 13 healthy volunteers is presented, and the main aspects of signal processing for artifact cancellation and feature extraction were discussed. Based on the obtained results, it was concluded that slow-wave electrical gastric activity can be recorded during driving simulation by following adequate recommendations and that proposed features could be beneficial in describing non-ordinary electrogastrography signals.","[Popovic, Nenad B.; Miljkovic, Nadica; Prodanov, Milana] Univ Belgrade, Sch Elect Engn, Belgrade 11000, Serbia; [Stojmenova, Kristina; Jakus, Grega; Sodnik, Jaka] Univ Ljubljana, Fac Elect Engn, Ljubljana 1000, Slovenia",University of Belgrade; University of Ljubljana,"Sodnik, J (corresponding author), Univ Ljubljana, Fac Elect Engn, Ljubljana 1000, Slovenia.",jaka.sodnik@fe.uni-lj.si,"Miljković, Nadica/L-5211-2015","Miljković, Nadica/0000-0002-3933-6076; Popovic, Nenad/0000-0002-5221-1446","Slovenian Research Agency [L2-8178]; Ministry of education, science, and technological development, Republic of Serbia [TR-33020, TR-32047]","Slovenian Research Agency(Slovenian Research Agency - Slovenia); Ministry of education, science, and technological development, Republic of Serbia","The authors acknowledge the financial support from the project ""Neurophysiological and cognitive profiling of driving skills"" L2-8178 by the Slovenian Research Agency.

Smart converters are simple or interleaved converters. They are equipped with controllers that are able to online impedance match for the maximum power transfer. These conversion systems are particularly feasible for photovoltaic and all renewable energies systems working in continuous changing operating conditions. Smart converters represent promising solutions in recent energetic scenarios, in fact their application is deepening and widening. In this context, the availability of a hardware platform could represent a useful tool. The platform was conceived and released as an open hardware instrument for academy and industry to benefit from the improvements brought by the researchers' community. The usage of a novel, open-source platform would allow many developers to design smart converters, focusing on algorithms instead of electronics, which could result in a better overall development ecosystem and rapid growth in the number of smart converter applications. The platform itself is proposed as a benchmark in the development and testing of different maximum power point tracking algorithms. The designed system is capable of accurate code implementations, allowing the testing of different current and voltage-controlled algorithms for different renewable energies systems. The circuit features a bi-directional radio frequency communication channel that enables real-time reading of measurements and parameters, and remote modification of both algorithm types and settings. The proposed system was developed and successfully tested in laboratory with a solar module simulator and with real photovoltaic generators. Experimental results indicate state-of-art performances as a converter, while enhanced smart features pave the way to system-level management, real-time diagnostics, and on-the-flight parameters change. Furthermore, the deployment feasibility allows different combinations and arrangements of several energy sources, converters (both single and multi-converters), and modulation strategies. To our knowledge, this project remains the only open-source hardware smart converter platform used for educational, research, and industrial purposes so far.","[Merenda, Massimo; Iero, Demetrio; Pangallo, Giovanni; Falduto, Paolo; Della Corte, Francesco G.] Univ Mediterranea Reggio Calabria, DIIES Dept, I-89126 Reggio Di Calabria, Italy; [Merenda, Massimo; Iero, Demetrio; Della Corte, Francesco G.] Spin Off Univ Mediterranea Reggio Calabria, HWA Srl, Via R Campi II Tr 135, I-89126 Reggio Di Calabria, Italy; [Adinolfi, Giovanna; Merola, Angelo; Graditi, Giorgio] ENEA CR Portici, Piazzale Enrico Fermi 1, I-80055 Naples, Italy",Universita Mediterranea di Reggio Calabria; Italian National Agency New Technical Energy & Sustainable Economics Development,"Merenda, M (corresponding author), Univ Mediterranea Reggio Calabria, DIIES Dept, I-89126 Reggio Di Calabria, Italy.; Merenda, M (corresponding author), Spin Off Univ Mediterranea Reggio Calabria, HWA Srl, Via R Campi II Tr 135, I-89126 Reggio Di Calabria, Italy.",massimo.merenda@unirc.it; demetrio.iero@unirc.it; giovanni.pangallo@unirc.it; paolo.falduto.572@studenti.unirc.it; giovanna.adinolfi@enea.it; angelo.merola@enea.it; giorgio.graditi@enea.it; francesco.dellacorte@unirc.it,"Iero, Demetrio/AAO-1064-2020; Merenda, Massimo/K-7061-2013","Merenda, Massimo/0000-0003-3668-8014; Adinolfi, Giovanna/0000-0002-7191-5502; Della Corte, Francesco/0000-0002-2407-2979",Italian Ministry of Economic Development,"Italian Ministry of Economic Development(Ministry of Economic Development, Italy)",This work was supported by the Italian Ministry of Economic Development in the framework of the Operating Agreement with ENEA for Research on the Electric System.,,17,9,9,0,3,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",2079-9292,,,ELECTRONICS-SWITZ,Electronics,MAR,2019,8,3,,,,,,,367,10.3390/electronics8030367,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/electronics8030367,,,15,"Computer Science, Information Systems; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Physics, Applied",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Computer Science; Engineering; Physics,HU9VO,,gold,,,8/15/24,WOS:000465642600011,,0,2415,,0,H

Power consumption monitoring in manufacturing companies can lead to a reduction of machine tools energy wastes and consequently to lower expenses. To this end, a complete transparency of energy usage among the entire manufacturing facilities is required. Despite the small volume of material processed, micro manufacturing processes are energy intensive and the optimization of energy usage becomes critical for manufacturing sustainability. Electrical discharge machining (EDM) is considered an attractive solution for the manufacturing of microcomponents. In this paper, a low cost and modular data acquisition system, based on open-hardware and open-source software, for online energy consumption monitoring, is presented. The system described is applied for energy efficiency analysis of the micro EDM milling process by using a state of the art commercial machine tool.

However, published results usually focus on the experiment, disregarding technical details of the scientific equipment. Lacking enough information about these custom devices prevents their accurate replication, hindering the experiment reproducibility, which is a fundamental requirement for Open Science. In the field of Geology, custom electromechanical devices with low-speed moving elements are required to analyze scaled-down models of the tectonic deformation processes. In these experiments, the earth crust is modeled with materials whose properties and setup are scrupulously specified to comply with the scale model theory and to have standard and reproducible procedures. Notwithstanding this rigorous characterization, we believe that the moving apparatus has received little attention, implicitly assuming an ideal behavior despite the difficulties of moving uniformly at such slow speeds, which could produce disparities with the natural model. In this paper we address this issue by presenting a device for scientific analogue modeling of contractional and extensional tectonics. We analyze the challenges and implications of moving at such low speeds, demonstrate its satisfactory performance and provide suggestions for improvement. In addition, the proposed apparatus is not only affordable and relatively easy to build, but also is an open-hardware project that can be replicated, improved or customized, even in other research fields. We hope that this contribution will be beneficial for the scientific and educational community, facilitating the reliability of experiments, the exchange of ideas, and thereby the promotion of Open Science.","[Machado, Felipe; Nieto, Ruben; Fernandez-Garcia, Cristina; Borromeo, Susana] Univ Rey Juan Carlos, Area Elect Technol, Mostoles 28933, Spain; [Machado, Felipe] Univ Las Palmas Gran Canaria, Inst Appl Microelect, Las Palmas Gran Canaria 35017, Spain; [Ramos, Marta Rincon; Gonzalez-Munoz, Sandra; Martin-Gonzalez, Fidel] Univ Rey Juan Carlos, Escuela Super Ciencias Expt & Tecnol ESCET, Area Geol, Tecvolrisk Res Grp, Mostoles 28933, Spain",Universidad Rey Juan Carlos; Universidad de Las Palmas de Gran Canaria; Universidad Rey Juan Carlos,"Borromeo, S (corresponding author), Univ Rey Juan Carlos, Area Elect Technol, Mostoles 28933, Spain.",susana.borromeo@urjc.es,"Nieto, Rubén/ACO-5821-2022; Machado, Felipe/N-5051-2018; Martin-Gonzalez, Fidel/G-3235-2015","Nieto, Rubén/0000-0002-8293-9665; Machado, Felipe/0000-0001-7674-0943; Rincon, Marta/0000-0003-3469-9190; Fernandez Garcia, Cristina/0000-0003-0735-4170; Borromeo, Susana/0000-0002-2353-2902; Martin-Gonzalez, Fidel/0000-0002-5239-1846; Gonzalez Munoz, Sandra/0000-0001-8985-5088",,,,,70,0,0,0,1,IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC,PISCATAWAY,"445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA",2169-3536,,,IEEE ACCESS,IEEE Access,,2023,11,,,,,,31716,31746,,10.1109/ACCESS.2023.3262617,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2023.3262617,,,31,"Computer Science, Information Systems; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Telecommunications",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Computer Science; Engineering; Telecommunications,D2VX4,,gold,,,8/15/24,WOS:000967362900001,,0,2418,,0,H

Before the tape-out, a pre-silicon design has to be thoroughly inspected by time-consuming functional verification and code review to exclude bugs. For functional verification and code review, a critical issue determining their efficiency is the allocation of resources (e.g., computational resources and manpower) to different modules of a design, which is conventionally guided by designers' experiences. Such practices, though simple and straightforward, may take high risks of wasting resources on bug-free modules or missing bugs in buggy modules, and thus could affect the success and timeline of the tape-out. In this paper, we propose a novel framework called pre-silicon bug forecast to predict the bug information of hardware designs. In this framework, bug models are built via machine learning techniques to characterize the relationship between design characteristics and the bug information, which can be leveraged to predict how bugs distribute in different modules of the current design. Such predicted bug information is adequate to regulate the resources among different modules to achieve efficient functional verification and code review. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed pre-silicon bug forecast framework, we conducted detailed experiments on several open-source hardware projects. Moreover, we also investigate the impacts of different learning techniques and different sets of characteristic on the performance of bug models. Experimental results show that with appropriate learning techniques and characteristics, about 90% modules could be correctly predicted as buggy or clean and the number of bugs of each module could also be accurately predicted.","[Guo, Qi; Chen, Tianshi; Chen, Yunji; Hu, Weiwu] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Comp Technol, State Key Lab Comp Architecture, Beijing 100190, Peoples R China; [Wang, Rui] Anhui USTC iFLYTEK Co Ltd, Hefei 230088, Peoples R China; [Chen, Huanhuan] Univ Sci & Technol China, Hefei 230027, Peoples R China; [Chen, Guoliang] Univ Sci & Technol China, Sch Comp Sci & Technol, Hefei 230027, Peoples R China","Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Computing Technology, CAS; Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Science & Technology of China, CAS; Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Science & Technology of China, CAS","Chen, TS (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Comp Technol, State Key Lab Comp Architecture, Beijing 100190, Peoples R China.",joyguoqi@gmail.com; chentianshi@ict.ac.cn; cyj@ict.ac.cn; wrui1108@mail.ustc.edu.cn; hchen@ustc.edu.cn; hww@ict.ac.cn; glchen@ustc.edu.cn,"wang, rui/JAC-6240-2023; Chen, Huanhuan/HTO-5007-2023","Chen, Yunji/0000-0003-3925-5185","Strategic Priority Research Program of the Chinese Academy of Sciences [XDA06010401-02]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [61100163, 61003064, 61222204, 61050002, 61173006, 61133004, 61173001]; National S&T Major Project of China [2009ZX01028-002-003, 2009ZX01029-001-03, 2010ZX01036-001-002]; National 863 Program of China [2012AA012202]; One Thousand Young Talents Program",Strategic Priority Research Program of the Chinese Academy of Sciences(Chinese Academy of Sciences); National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); National S&T Major Project of China; National 863 Program of China(National High Technology Research and Development Program of China); One Thousand Young Talents Program,"This work was supported in part by the Strategic Priority Research Program of the Chinese Academy of Sciences under Grant XDA06010401-02, in part by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant 61100163, Grant 61003064, Grant 61222204, Grant 61050002, Grant 61173006, Grant 61133004, and Grant 61173001, in part by the National S&T Major Project of China under Grant 2009ZX01028-002-003, Grant 2009ZX01029-001-03, and Grant 2010ZX01036-001-002, and in part by the National 863 Program of China under Grant 2012AA012202.

These are essentially cheap, easy-to-handle systems, offering rapid sample-to-answer results to non-technical operators. In this perspective, we do not review all the current advances of Lab-on-a-chip techniques for the realisation of PoC. Instead, we aim to provide insight into what we foresee as the three most important factors to play the essential roles for succeeding in making commercially viable PoC pathogen-detection devices. The three insights are namely: the utilizations of (i) disposable polymer (microfluidic) chips, (ii) the implementation of surface-bound (or solid-phase) nucleic-acid amplification techniques and (iii) relying (more) on open-source hardware and software.

Among Trusted Execution Environment (TEE), an open-source RISC-V Keystone TEE is the expected one. However, some issues remain when applying it to various devices: untrusted DRAM, and untrusted path to non-volatile storage. These issues can be resolved by Memory Protection Engine (MPE) based on an integrity tree, and Non-Volatile Main Memory (NVMM), respectively. TEE, MPE, and NVMM must be cooperatively optimized to exploit performance. Despite this demand, there is no widely available platform which enables fast, reliable, and system-wide evaluation. In the paper, we provide an open-source hardware simulator for secure edge devices. We implemented an MPE using SGX-style Integrity Tree on the Keystone compatible RISC-V SoC. Then, we ported the NVMM simulation technique to it. Its whole design was publicized to widely provide a baseline hardware design. The MPE behavior was validated by using micro benchmarks. It revealed that the MPE read/write overhead 2.55 x /4.16x on DRAM, and 3.05 x /5.40x on NVMM, respectively Besides, we discuss our work's role by comparing with the gem5 considering TEE evaluation time and impact of the protected NVMM.","[Omori, Yu; Kimura, Keiji] Waseda Univ, Dept Comp Sci & Engn, Tokyo 1698050, Japan",Waseda University,"Kimura, K (corresponding author), Waseda Univ, Dept Comp Sci & Engn, Tokyo 1698050, Japan.",oy@kasahara.cs.waseda.ac.jp; keiji@waseda.jp,"Kimura, Keiji/GWV-7240-2022","Kimura, Keiji/0000-0003-2325-4866; OMORI, Yu/0000-0002-7554-6214",,,,,22,0,0,2,3,IEEE COMPUTER SOC,LOS ALAMITOS,"10662 LOS VAQUEROS CIRCLE, PO BOX 3014, LOS ALAMITOS, CA 90720-1314 USA",1556-6056,1556-6064,,IEEE COMPUT ARCHIT L,IEEE Comput.

Numerous platforms for smart sensors have been developed, most of which utilise proprietary hardware/software. The Berkeley Mote, utilised in this study, was the first open hardware/software platform to be developed. However, the Berkeley Mote was designed for generic applications and therefore the available sensors are not optimised for use in civil infrastructure applications. Acceleration and strain are among the most important physical quantities to judge the health of a structure. Although commercially available sensor boards have accelerometers, their applicability towards civil infrastructure is limited.

Traffic noise on city roads has been identified as one of the major problems in urban settlements. Fortunately, it can be monitored and controlled in a way that can reduce its level and negative effects. One of the most effective and cheapest ways to monitor and control traffic noise is to use wireless sensor networks, IoT technology, and cloud-based architectures.

Yet in much of the developing world, prohibitive costs are a substantial barrier to universal access. One area where this is clear is surgical fracture tables, which generally cost >US$200,000 new. With the advent of 3-D printing, a new way to reduce medical equipment costs is to use open source hardware licensed designs to fabricate digitally-distributed manufactured medical hardware. That approach is applied here to make surgical tables more accessible. This study describes the design and manufacture of an open source surgical fracture table that uses materials that are widely available worldwide with specialty components being 3-D printed. The bill of materials and assembly instructions are detailed and the fracture table is validated to perform mechanically to specifications. Using an open source desktop RepRap-class 3-D printer, the components can be printed in a little over a week of continuous printing. Including the 3-D printed parts, the open source fracture table can be constructed for under US$3,000 in material costs, representing a 98.5% savings for commercial systems, radically increasing accessibility. The open source table can be adjusted 90-116 cm in height, tilted from +/-15 degrees, the leg height ranges from 31 to 117 cm, the arm supports and foot holder both have a 180-degree range, the foot position has a 54 cm range, and the legs can be adjusted from 55 to 120 degrees. It is mechanically adjusted so does not require electricity, however, surgical staff need to be trained on how to perform needed adjustments during surgery. The open source surgical table has verified performance for mechanical loading over 130 kg, geometric flexibility to allow for wide array of common surgeries, is radiolucent in surgical zones, and is modular and upgradeable.","[Bow, J.

The system monitors location (global positioning system), rider control data (level of assistance) and other custom sensor input in real time. The SEMS data feeds an online interface for data analysis, for riders to view their own data and for sharing on social media. The basic system can be replicated by other researchers and can be extended with modules to explore various issues in e-bike research.

Traditionally, the volume of such measurements has been limited by the high cost of commercially available instruments. An increasingly attractive solution to this cost issue is to use instruments produced in-house from open-source hardware, firmware, and postprocessing building blocks. In the present work, we release the next iteration of our open-source drifter and wave-monitoring instrument, which follows these solution aspects. The new design is significantly less expensive (typically by a factor of 5 compared with our previous, already cost-effective instrument), much easier to build and assemble for people without specific microelectronics and programming competence, more easily extendable and customizable, and two orders of magnitude more power-efficient (to the point where solar panels are no longer needed even for long-term deployments). Improving performance and reducing noise levels and costs compared with our previous generation of instruments is possible in large part thanks to progress from the electronics component industry. As a result, we believe that this will allow scientists in geosciences to increase by an order of magnitude the amount of in situ data they can collect under a constant instrumentation budget. In the following, we offer (1) a detailed overview of our hardware and software solution, (2) in situ validation and benchmarking of our instrument, (3) a fully open-source release of both hardware and software blueprints. We hope that this work, and the associated open-source release, will be a milestone that will allow our scientific fields to transition towards open-source, community-driven instrumentation. We believe that this could have a considerable impact on many fields by making in situ instrumentation at least an order of magnitude less expensive and more customizable than it has been for the last 50 years, marking the start of a new paradigm in oceanography and polar science, where instrumentation is an inexpensive commodity and in situ data are easier and less expensive to collect.","[Rabault, Jean; Hope, Gaute; Mueller, Malte; Breivik, Oyvind; Hole, Lars Robert; Bohlinger, Patrik; Christensen, Kai Haakon] Norwegian Meteorol Inst, N-0313 Oslo, Norway; [Nose, Takehiko; Waseda, Takuji; Kodaira, Tsubasa; Katsuno, Tomotaka] Univ Tokyo, Grad Sch Frontier Sci, Kashiwa, Chiba 2778561, Japan; [Mueller, Malte; Jensen, Atle; Gundersen, Olav] Univ Oslo, Dept Math, N-0313 Oslo, Norway; [Voermans, Joey; Babanin, Alexander] Univ Melbourne, Dept Infrastruct Engn, Parkville, Vic 3052, Australia; [Waseda, Takuji] Japan Agcy Marine Earth Sci & Technol, Yokosuka, Kanagawa 2370061, Japan; [Johnson, Mark] Univ Alaska Fairbanks, Coll Fisheries & Ocean Sci, Fairbanks, AK 99775 USA; [Sutherland, Graig] Environm Numer Predict Res, Environm Climate Change Canada, Dorval, PQ H9P 1J3, Canada; [Johansson, Malin] UiT Arctic Univ Norway, Dept Phys & Technol, N-9037 Tromso, Norway; [Garbo, Adam] Carleton Univ, Water & Ice Res Lab, Ottawa, ON K1S 5B6, Canada; [Marchenko, Aleksey] Univ Ctr Svalbard, Dept Arctic Technol, POB 156, N-9171 Longyearbyen, Norway",Norwegian Meteorological Institute; University of Tokyo; University of Oslo; University of Melbourne; Japan Agency for Marine-Earth Science & Technology (JAMSTEC); University of Alaska System; University of Alaska Fairbanks; Environment & Climate Change Canada; UiT The Arctic University of Tromso; Carleton University; University Centre Svalbard (UNIS),"Rabault, J (corresponding author), Norwegian Meteorol Inst, N-0313 Oslo, Norway.",jean.rblt@gmail.com; tak.nose@edu.k.u-tokyo.ac.jp; gauteh@met.no; maltem@met.no; oyvindb@met.no; jvoermans@unimelb.edu.au; lrh@met.no; patrikb@met.no; waseda@k.u-tokyo.ac.jp; kodaira@edu.k.u-tokyo.ac.jp; katsuno@s.otpe.k.u-tokyo.ac.jp; majohnson@alaska.edu; graigory.sutherland@canada.ca; malin.johansson@uit.no; kaihc@met.no; adamgarbo@cmail.carleton.ca; atlej@math.uio.no; olavgun@math.uio.no; alekseym@unis.no; a.babanin@unimelb.edu.au,"Marchenko, Aleksey/GSD-3516-2022; Waseda, Takuji/F-1445-2019; Muller, Malte/AAD-7692-2022","Marchenko, Aleksey/0000-0003-4169-0063; Muller, Malte/0000-0003-2871-8359; Johansson, Malin/0000-0003-0129-2239; Jensen, Atle/0000-0001-7376-0850; Christensen, Kai Hakon/0000-0002-5775-794X; Hole, Lars Robert/0000-0002-2246-9235; Babanin, Alexander/0000-0002-8595-8204; Garbo, Adam/0000-0002-7312-7390; Bohlinger, Patrik/0000-0002-7299-3676; Rabault, Jean/0000-0002-7244-6592; Waseda, Takuji/0000-0001-5403-5303","Research Council of Norway through ThinTEC [A321200]; Norwegian Polar Institute through ThinIce [66017]; ArCS II Japan-Russia-Canada International Exchange Program; Arctic Challenge for Sustainability II Project (ArCS II Project) [JPMXD1420318865]; JSPS KAKENHI [JP 19H00801, 19H05512, 21K14357]; DOFI Petromaks II project [28062]; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [20K20437, 21K14357] Funding Source: KAKEN","Research Council of Norway through ThinTEC(Research Council of Norway); Norwegian Polar Institute through ThinIce; ArCS II Japan-Russia-Canada International Exchange Program; Arctic Challenge for Sustainability II Project (ArCS II Project); JSPS KAKENHI(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI)); DOFI Petromaks II project; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))","This work was funded by the Research Council of Norway through ThinTEC (project number A321200), Norwegian Polar Institute through ThinIce (project number 66017); the ArCS II Japan-Russia-Canada International Exchange Program; the Arctic Challenge for Sustainability II Project (ArCS II Project, Program Grant Number JPMXD1420318865); the JSPS KAKENHI Grant Number JP 19H00801, 19H05512, and 21K14357; the DOFI Petromaks II project (funding to the University of Oslo, by the Research Council of Norway funding, grant number 28062).",,66,18,18,4,12,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2076-3263,,GEOSCIENCES,Geosciences,MAR,2022,12,3,,,,,,,110,10.3390/geosciences12030110,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/geosciences12030110,,,25,"Geosciences, Multidisciplinary",Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI),Geology,0E8TS,,"Green Submitted, Green Published, gold",,,8/15/24,WOS:000776947500001,,0,2428,,0,H

Any up-gradation of the hardware in the existing communication devices is not easier one. Compatibility of the new hardware with existing hardware is highly essential. But the new protocols may or may not support the older one. The solution for these problems can be provided by using the reconfigurable hardware design. The hardware can be reprogrammed according to the new change in technology up-gradation. The cost of commercially available hardware and software requirements for setting up such a module is very high. This can be solved by using Open source hardware and software such as Universal Software Radio Peripheral (USRP) and GNU Radio. This work demonstrates how the modern analog communication system like Community Radio Schemes and Radio Data System (RDS) and digital communication systems such as Simple Digital Video Broadcasting (DVB) and OFDM based data communication can be developed using the Open source hardware USRP1.

Despite the research progress, the industry still doubts its applicability, especially for the functional verification of complicated processor chips. Functional verification commonly employs a simulation-based method of co-simulating the design under test with a reference model and checking the consistency of their outcomes given the same input stimuli. We observe limited collaboration and information exchange through the design and verification processes, dramatically leading to inefficiencies when applying the conventional functional verification workflow to agile development. In this paper, we propose workflow integration with collaborative task delegation and dynamic information exchange as the design principles to effectively address the challenges on functional verification under the agile development model. Based on workflow integration, we enhance the functional verification workflows with a series of novel methodologies and toolchains. The diff-rule based agile verification methodology (DRAV) reduces the overhead of building reference models with runtime execution information from designs under test. We present the RISC-V implementation for DRAV, DiffTest, which adopts information probes to extract internal design behaviors for co-simulation and debugging. It further integrates two plugins, namely XFUZZ for effective test generation guided by design coverage metrics and LightSSS for efficient fault analysis triggered by co-simulation mismatches. We present the integrated workflows for agile hardware development and demonstrate their effectiveness in designing and verifying RISC-V processors with 33 functional bugs found in NutShell. We also illustrate the efficiency of the proposed toolchains with a case study on a functional bug in the L2 cache of XiangShan.","[Xu, Yi-Nan; Yu, Zi-Hao; Wang, Kai-Fan; Wang, Hua-Qiang; Lin, Jia-Wei; Jin, Yue; Zhang, Lin-Juan; Zhang, Zi-Fei; Tang, Dan; Wang, Sa; Shi, Kan; Sun, Ning-Hui; Bao, Yun-Gang] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Comp Technol, State Key Lab Processors, Beijing 100190, Peoples R China; [Xu, Yi-Nan; Wang, Kai-Fan; Wang, Hua-Qiang; Lin, Jia-Wei; Jin, Yue; Zhang, Lin-Juan; Zhang, Zi-Fei; Sun, Ning-Hui; Bao, Yun-Gang] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China; [Tang, Dan] Beijing Inst Open Source Chip, Beijing 100080, Peoples R China","Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Computing Technology, CAS; Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, CAS","Bao, YG (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Comp Technol, State Key Lab Processors, Beijing 100190, Peoples R China.; Bao, YG (corresponding author), Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China.",xuyinan@ict.ac.cn; yuzihao@ict.ac.cn; wangkaifan@ict.ac.cn; wanghuaqiang20s@ict.ac.cn; linjiawei20s@ict.ac.cn; jinyue20s@ict.ac.cn; zhanglinjuan20s@ict.ac.cn; zhangzifei@ict.ac.cn; tangdan@ict.ac.cn; wangsa@ict.ac.cn; shikan@ict.ac.cn; snh@ict.ac.cn; baoyg@ict.ac.cn,"Yu, ZH/KBC-6889-2024; lin, lin/KFB-9548-2024; Liu, Zhe/KEJ-5299-2024; Wang, Fei/KEH-6292-2024; Liu, yuqing/KEI-3260-2024; yan, su/KHT-1728-2024; Wang, Siying/KHX-1894-2024; Wang, Yifan/KDO-8319-2024; Zhang, Linjuan/Y-8097-2019; Sun, Yang/KHY-5117-2024; zhang, yingying/KGM-8162-2024","zhang, yingying/0000-0001-7479-3398","Strategic Priority Research Program of Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS) [XDC05030200]; National Key Research and Development Program of China [2022YFB4500403]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [62090022, 62172388]; Youth Innovation Promotion Association of the Chinese Academy of Sciences [2020105]; Institute of Computing Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences [E261100]","Strategic Priority Research Program of Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS); National Key Research and Development Program of China(National Key Research & Development Program of China); National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Youth Innovation Promotion Association of the Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Computing Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences","This work was supported in part by the Strategic Priority Research Program of Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS) under Grant No. XDC05030200, the National Key Research and Development Program of China under Grant No. 2022YFB4500403, the National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant Nos. 62090022 and 62172388, the Youth Innovation Promotion Association of the Chinese Academy of Sciences under Grant No. 2020105, and the Innovation Grant No. E261100 by Institute of Computing Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences.",,33,0,0,4,6,SPRINGER SINGAPORE PTE LTD,SINGAPORE,"152 Beach Road, #21-01 Gateway East, SINGAPORE, SINGAPORE",1000-9000,1860-4749,,J COMPUT SCI TECH-CH,J.

This review explores the applications of Raspberry Pi in microfluidics, with a focus on imaging, including microscopy and automated image capture.

The control of image capture permitted by Raspberry Pi hardware can also be combined with onboard image analysis. Open-source hardware offers an opportunity to develop complex laboratory instrumentation systems at a fraction of the cost of commercial equipment and, importantly, offers an opportunity for complete customisation to meet the users' needs. However, these benefits come with a trade-off: challenges remain for those wishing to incorporate open-source hardware equipment in their own work, including requirements for construction and operator skill, the need for good documentation and the availability of rapid prototyping such as 3D printing plus other components.

Development of aquatic germplasm repositories is impeded by a lack of standardization within laboratories and across the research community. Protocols for cryopreservation are often developed ad hoc and without close attention to variables, such as cell concentration, that strongly affect the success and reproducibility of cryopreservation. The wide dissemination and use of specialized tools and devices as open hardware can improve processing reliability and save costs. The goal of the present work was to develop and prototype a modular and open-technology approach to help to standardize the cell concentration of germplasm samples prior to cryopreservation. The specific objectives were to: 1) design and fabricate prototypes of the automated concentration measurement and adjustment system (CMAS), incorporating custom peristaltic pumps and optical evaluation modules, and 2) evaluate the performance of the CMAS with biological samples. Linear regression models were obtained for estimation of aquatic sperm concentration > 10 8 cells/mL and for algae concentration > (3 x 10 5 ) cells/mL. Algae were diluted with extender medium by an automated process, resulting in a dilution precision of +/- 12.6% and +/- 6.7% in two trials, attaining means of 89% and 71% of the target cell concentration. The development of the CMAS as open technology can provide opportunities for community-level standardization in cryopreservation of aquatic germplasm and can invite new users, makers, and developers into the open-technology community. This will increase the reach and capabilities of much-needed aquatic germplasm repositories.","[Zuchowicz, Nikolas; Liu, Yue; Tiersch, Terrence R.] Louisiana State Univ, Agr Ctr, Aquat Germplasm & Genet Resources Ctr, Sch Renewable Nat Resources, Baton Rouge, LA USA; [Liu, Yue; Monroe, W.

Nowadays, industrial advances make the electronic stages in these systems obsolete compared to the mechanical elements, which generates a recurring problem in technological, commercial and industrial applications. This article presents a methodology for the development of an open-architecture controller that is based on reconfigurable hardware under the open source concept for servo applications. The most outstanding contribution of this paper is the implementation of a Genetic Algorithm for online self tuning with a focus on both high-quality servo control and reduction of vibrations during the positioning of a linear motion system. The proposed techniques have been validated on a real platform and form a novel, effective approach as compared to the conventional tuning methods that employ empirical or analytical solutions and cannot improve their parameter set. The controller was elaborated from the Graphical User Interface to the logical implementation while using free tools. This approach also allows for modification and updates to be made easily, thereby reducing the susceptibility to obsolescence. A comparison of the logical implementation with the manufacturer software was also conducted in order to test the performance of free tools in FPGAs. The Graphical User Interface developed in Python presents features, such as speed profiling, controller auto-tuning, measurement of main parameters, and monitoring of servo system vibrations.","[Cruz-Miguel, Edson E.; Garcia-Martinez, Jose R.; Rodriguez-Resendiz, Juvenal; Carrillo-Serrano, Roberto, V] Univ Autonoma Queretaro, Fac Ingn, Div Invest & Posgrad, Queretaro 76010, Mexico",Universidad Autonoma de Queretaro,"Rodríguez-Reséndiz, J (corresponding author), Univ Autonoma Queretaro, Fac Ingn, Div Invest & Posgrad, Queretaro 76010, Mexico.",ecruz30@alumnos.uaq.mx; jose.gm@uaq.mx; juvenal@uaq.edu.mx; roberto.carrillo@uaq.mx,"Rodriguez-Resendiz, Juvenal/AAA-9293-2020; García-Martínez, José Román/HZU-3063-2023","Rodriguez-Resendiz, Juvenal/0000-0001-8598-5600; García-Martínez, José Román/0000-0001-5773-6068","Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia (CONACYT); ""Programa para el Desarrollo Profesional Docente"" (PRODEP)","Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia (CONACYT)(Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia (CONACyT)); ""Programa para el Desarrollo Profesional Docente"" (PRODEP)","This research was funded by the ""Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia (CONACYT)"" and also to ""Programa para el Desarrollo Profesional Docente"" (PRODEP).",,41,18,18,0,12,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,1424-8220,,SENSORS-BASEL,Sensors,NOV,2020,20,21,,,,,,,6155,10.3390/s20216155,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/s20216155,,,21,"Chemistry, Analytical; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Instruments & Instrumentation",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Chemistry; Engineering; Instruments & Instrumentation,OR1GI,33138049,"gold, Green Published",,,8/15/24,WOS:000589224300001,,0,2436,,0,H

Lack of reliable quality management tools has impeded repository development in the past several decades. Microfabricated open-hardware devices have emerged as a new approach to assist repository development by providing standardized quality assessment capabilities to enable routine quality control. However, prototyping of microfabricated devices (microdevices) traditionally relies on photolithography techniques that are costly, time intensive, and accessible only through specialized engineering laboratories. Although resin 3-D printing has been introduced into the microfabrication domain, existing publications focus on customized or high-cost (>thousands of USD) printers. The goal of this report was to identify and call attention to the emerging opportunities to support innovation in microfabrication by use of low-cost (<USD 350) resin 3-D printing for rapid prototyping. We demonstrate that low-cost mask-based stereolithography (MSLA) 3-D printers with straightforward modifications can provide fabrication quality that approaches traditional photolithography techniques. For example, reliable feature sizes of 20 <mu>m with dimensional discrepancy of <4% for lateral dimensions and <5% for vertical dimensions were fabricated with a consumer-level MSLA printers. In addition, alterations made to pre-processing, post-processing, and printer configuration steps improved print quality as demonstrated in objects with sharper edges and smoother surfaces. The prototyping time and cost of resin 3-D printing (3 h with USD 0.5/prototype) were considerably lower than those of traditional photolithography (5 d with USD 80/prototype). With the rapid advance of consumer-grade printers, resin 3-D printing can revolutionize rapid prototyping approaches for microdevices in the near future, facilitating participation in interdisciplinary development of innovative hardware to support germplasm repository development for aquatic species.","[Zuchowicz, Nikolas C.; Liu, Yue; Tiersch, Terrence R.] Louisiana State Univ, Agr Ctr, Sch Renewable Nat Resources, Aquatic Germplasm & Genet Resources Ctr, Baton Rouge, LA 70820 USA; [Belgodere, Jorge A.; Liu, Yue; Monroe, William Todd] Louisiana State Univ, Agr Ctr, Dept Biol & Agr Engn, Baton Rouge, LA 70803 USA; [Belgodere, Jorge A.; Semmes, Ignatius; Monroe, William Todd] Louisiana State Univ, Dept Biol & Agr Engn, Baton Rouge, LA 70803 USA",Louisiana State University System; Louisiana State University; Louisiana State University System; Louisiana State University; Louisiana State University System; Louisiana State University,"Tiersch, TR (corresponding author), Louisiana State Univ, Agr Ctr, Sch Renewable Nat Resources, Aquatic Germplasm & Genet Resources Ctr, Baton Rouge, LA 70820 USA.",nzucho1@lsu.edu; jbelgo1@lsu.edu; yliu@agcenter.lsu.edu; isemme1@lsu.edu; tmonroe@lsu.edu; ttiersch@agcenter.lsu.edu,,"Liu, Yue/0000-0003-3838-8277; Zuchowicz, Nikolas/0000-0002-3577-0190; Belgodere, Jorge/0000-0003-3399-4796","National Institutes of Health, Office of Research Infrastructure Programs [R24-OD010441, R24-OD028443]; National Institute of Food and Agriculture, United States Department of Agriculture [LAB94420, NC1194]; Louisiana State University Research & Technology Foundation [AG-2018-LIFT-003]; LSU-ACRES (Audubon Center for Research of Endangered Species) Collaborative Program; Paul M.

Recent news regarding global warming has increased the need to save energy. In Finland, one of the major sources of energy consumption is housing. Furthermore, the heating of residential buildings accounts for up to 68% of housing energy consumption. Therefore, it is not surprising that apartment energy consumption and ways to save energy in housing are a popular research topic in Finland. In this paper, two different research areas are introduced: First, a literature survey is presented on the research subjects of energy saving in the area of real estate and housing. The goal is to gain overall knowledge of the current state of energy saving research. The overall conclusion is that knowledge of energy consumption improves efforts toward energy saving. Second, rapid prototyping with off-the-shelf devices and open source software are described. These devices are cheap to install, and a wide range of sensors are available. Consequently, it is important to deal with these topics together. The former studies provide knowledge about the usage of open hardware, open software, and open architectures with the development of prototype systems for gathering data. The literature survey gives us new information on the specialties of energy consumption measuring, offering a new area for modeling and developing prototype systems. These experiences will be taken forward and utilized in energy saving and environmentally sustainable solutions, such as Green Computing.","[Saari, Mika; Sillberg, Pekka; Gronman, Jere; Kuusisto, Markku; Rantanen, Petri; Jaakkola, Hannu] Tampere Univ, Fac Informat Technol & Commun Sci, Pohjoisranta 11A, Pori 28101, Finland; [Henno, Jaak] Tallinn Univ Technol, Sch Informat Technol, Ehitajate Tee 5, EE-19086 Tallinn, Estonia",Tampere University; Tallinn University of Technology,"Saari, M (corresponding author), Tampere Univ, Fac Informat Technol & Commun Sci, Pohjoisranta 11A, Pori 28101, Finland.",mika.saari@tuni.fi; pekka.sillberg@tuni.fi; jere.gronman@tuni.fi; markku.kuusisto@tuni.fi; petri.rantanen@tuni.fi; hannu.jaakkola@tuni.fi; jaak.henno@ttu.ee,"Saari, M./AAK-7235-2020; Jaakkola, Hannu/B-3889-2013; Henno, Jaak/AAF-2529-2019; Sillberg, Pekka/KRP-6550-2024","Sillberg, Pekka/0000-0003-2573-4775; Saari, Mika/0000-0001-7677-2355; Gronman, Jere/0000-0002-3810-9189",European Regional Development Fund; Tampere University,European Regional Development Fund(European Union (EU)); Tampere University,"This work was supported by the European Regional Development Fund.

To automate and monitor these challenging infrastructures, industrial equipment is used due to their reliability and versatility. In particular, Programmable Logic Controllers (PLCs) are the prevalent automation units devoted to process control. They are combined with Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems, responsible of acquiring and displaying operational data. One of the prominent trends to facilitate such deployment is the open source movement, being the Arduino microcontroller one of the most illustrative examples. This low-cost and community-supported platform is achieving increasing attention from academy and industry. However, there is still a need of integration frameworks to combine this device with reliable industrial equipment. This paper presents an approach that seamlessly integrates PLCs and Arduino platforms into a common SCADA system using the connectivity provided by Open Platform Communications (OPC). The open source device is devoted to sensing tasks.

There is an open area to develop and to build didactic modules to improve the learning process using experimentation in real physical systems. Particularly, a cart inverted pendulum is a classical physical system very commonly used in recent decades. We propose a cart inverted pendulum named MoDiCA-X as a low-cost didactic module with open source hardware and software. It is an electromechanical system feasible to build and easy to be modified. The mechanical parts of the module are 3D printed solids and can also be easily replicated. In terms of programming, the control applied to the system can be modified, since it uses C/C++ programming languages that are widely used in the academic community. The module is equipped with two very commercial sensors, are easy to install and to remove; both acquire the pendulum attitude and the car position. The actuators are four electric DC motors coupled to the car wheels to provide suitable velocity and torque to each axle independently. We validate the performance of the module by applying a multivariable linear quadratic regulator algorithm (LQR). (C) 2020 The Authors.

This strategy centrally involves the downstream firms distributing design costs over multiple down-stream firms-a strategy that is routine to producers selling to multiple down-stream firms but which has been in the past typically not practical for coalitions of downstream firms. Today, downstream firms find it increasingly feasible to codesign products they may all purchase because of two technological trends. First, computer-aided design/computer-aided manufacturing and other design technologies are lowering downstream firms' costs to develop designs for purchased hardware inputs. Second, better communication technologies are lowering the costs of doing such projects collaboratively, even among large groups of downstream customer firms. Downstream firms collaborating to develop a design for a hardware input they can all purchase could in principle choose to protect their design as a club good. However, opening up collaboratively created designs to free riders can increase the profits of the contributing firms for several reasons we explore and model. Important among these is that free revealing draws free riders away from purchases of proprietary software or hardware to customer-developed free substitutes. This ""scale-stealing"" mechanism reduces the markets of up-stream suppliers of competing proprietary inputs. In the case of hardware only, free riders also contribute to reducing the average manufacturing costs of the open hardware by increasing purchase volumes and so creating increased economies of scale. Resulting reduced unit purchase costs benefit downstream firms contributing to the free design as well as free riders.","[Gambardella, Alfonso] Bocconi Univ, Dept Management & Technol, Invernizzi Ctr Res Innovat Org Strategy & Entrepr, I-20136 Milan, Italy; [Gambardella, Alfonso] Ctr Econ Policy Res, London EC1V 0DX, England; [Von Hippel, Eric] MIT, MIT Sloan Sch Management, Cambridge, MA 02142 USA",Bocconi University; Centre for Economic Policy Research - UK; Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT),"Gambardella, A (corresponding author), Bocconi Univ, Dept Management & Technol, Invernizzi Ctr Res Innovat Org Strategy & Entrepr, I-20136 Milan, Italy.; Gambardella, A (corresponding author), Ctr Econ Policy Res, London EC1V 0DX, England.",alfonso.gambardella@unibocconi.it; evhippel@mit.edu,"; Gambardella, Alfonso/K-2641-2012","von Hippel, Eric/0000-0002-7235-1032; Gambardella, Alfonso/0000-0002-8714-5813",,,,,49,7,10,1,14,INFORMS,CATONSVILLE,"5521 RESEARCH PARK DR, SUITE 200, CATONSVILLE, MD 21228 USA",2333-2050,2333-2077,,STRATEG SCI,Strateg.

With the advent of open hardware initiatives, engineers, scientists, hobbyists, and even people with limited electronic skills have been able to tinker with complex electronic systems. Taking advantage of these inexpensive and widely available tools and in the context of an engineering project class for undergraduates, the authors set about building a working radiosonde prototype from the ground up, based on an open hardware platform and easily accessible components. As a result, a fully functional radiosonde has been built that measures, records, and transmits pressure, temperature, humidity, and wind, plus a small camera that stores images on a flash card. A release system was also developed so that the radiosonde can be detached from a balloon upon reaching a certain height, pressure level, or flight time. Once it is released., one can attempt the recovery of the radiosonde with the help of a precalculated trajectory using a numerical mesoscale forecasting model and visualization software. The performance of the sonde Was compared with two commercial radiosondes using climate chambers and two field launches. This paper also discusses some of the more interesting capabilities foreseeable for such a platform: 1) collaboration between meteorology and engineering departments in both education and research, and 2) development of a flexible hardware platform that allows for an effective way to compare different commercially available sensors and to easily integrate new prototype sensors.

These devices can be used to explore a wide range of scientific topics, from biology and chemistry to physics and engineering. In this study, we designed and built a multifunction fluorescent open source in vivo/in vitro imaging system (openIVIS) system that integrates a Raspberry Pi with commercial cameras and LEDs with 3D printed structures combined with an acrylic housing. Our openIVIS provides three excitation wavelengths of 460 nm, 520 nm, and 630 nm integrated with Python control software to enable fluorescent measurements across the full visible light spectrum. To demonstrate the potential applications of our system, we tested its performance against a diverse set of experiments including laboratory assays (measuring fluorescent dyes, using optical nanosensors, and DNA gel electrophoresis) to potentially fieldable applications (plant and mineral imaging). We also tested the potential use for a high school biology environment by imaging small animals and tracking their development over the course of ten days. Our system demonstrated its ability to measure a wide dynamic range fluorescent response from millimolar to picomolar concentrations in the same sample while measuring responses across visible wavelengths. These results demonstrate the power and flexibility of open-source hardware and software and how it can be integrated with customizable manufacturing to create low-cost scientific instruments with a wide range of applications.

The most concerning threats are hardware trojans. A hardware trojan is a malicious inclusion or alteration to the existing design of an integrated circuit, with the possible effects ranging from leakage of sensitive information to the complete destruction of the integrated circuit itself. While the majority of existing detection schemes focus on test-time, they all require expensive methodologies to detect hardware trojans. Off-the-shelf approaches have often been overlooked due to limited hardware resources and detection accuracy. With the advances in technologies and the democratisation of open-source hardware, however, these tools enable the detection of hardware trojans at reduced costs during or after production. In this manuscript, a hardware trojan is created and emulated on a consumer FPGA board. The experiments to detect the trojan in a dormant and active state are made using off-the-shelf technologies taking advantage of different techniques such as Power Analysis Reports, Side Channel Analysis and Thermal Measurements. Furthermore, multiple attempts to detect the trojan are demonstrated and benchmarked. Our simulations result in a state-of-the-art methodology to accurately detect the trojan in both dormant and active states using off-the-shelf hardware.","[Rooney, Catherine; Bellekens, Xavier] Abertay Univ, Div Cyber Secur, Dundee DD1 1HG, Scotland; [Seeam, Amar] Middlesex Univ, Dept Comp Sci, Mauritius Campus, Flic En Flac, Mauritius",University of Abertay Dundee; Middlesex University,"Bellekens, X (corresponding author), Abertay Univ, Div Cyber Secur, Dundee DD1 1HG, Scotland.",c.rooney@abertay.ac.uk; a.seeam@mdx.ac.mu; x.bellekens@abertay.ac.uk,"bellekens, xavier/AAA-2612-2020","bellekens, xavier/0000-0003-1849-5788; SEEAM, AMAR/0000-0001-8203-1545",,,,,28,15,15,0,11,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",2079-9292,,,ELECTRONICS-SWITZ,Electronics,JUL,2018,7,7,,,,,,,124,10.3390/electronics7070124,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/electronics7070124,,,21,"Computer Science, Information Systems; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Physics, Applied",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Computer Science; Engineering; Physics,GO7BU,,"Green Accepted, gold",,,8/15/24,WOS:000440211600025,,0,2451,,0,H

The global community sprang to action, producing a large number of emergency ""makeshift"" ventilator designs. This brought about another problem: a gap between the quantity of new mechanical ventilators and the number of skilled physicians to operate them. New physicians could not complete training at the pace of ventilator production, which threatened to leave patients sitting untreated, next to unusable ventilators. To address this challenge, we developed a universal remote control system for makeshift ventilators that uses low-cost hardware add-on modules to connect to different ventilators, and a three-tier control architecture to interface the ventilators with telemedicine software. We demonstrate system integration with two representative ventilator designs, adding a remote control option that allows caregivers to quickly and easily monitor and control these ventilators remotely.","[Barrow, Michael; Gobulukoglu, Mustafa; Kastner, Ryan] Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Comp Sci & Engn, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Restuccia, Francesco] Scuola Super Sant Anna, I-56127 Pisa, Italy; [Restuccia, Francesco] Univ Calif San Diego, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Rossi, Enrico] ELIOS Tech Srl, I-56019 Vecchiano, Italy",University of California System; University of California San Diego; Scuola Superiore Sant'Anna; University of California System; University of California San Diego,"Barrow, M (corresponding author), Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Comp Sci & Engn, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA.",mbarrow@eng.ucsd.edu; frestuccia@eng.ucsd.edu; mgobuluk@eng.ucsd.edu; enrico.rossi@elios-tech.com; kastner@eng.ucsd.edu,,"Rossi, Enrico/0000-0001-6990-8381; Gobulukoglu, Mustafa/0000-0002-5825-5300; Kastner, Ryan/0000-0001-9062-5570; Restuccia, Francesco/0000-0001-6955-1888",University of California at San Diego IEM Rapid Response GEM Challenge Program,University of California at San Diego IEM Rapid Response GEM Challenge Program,This work was supported in part by the University of California at San Diego IEM Rapid Response GEM Challenge Program.,,14,3,3,1,7,IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC,PISCATAWAY,"445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA",1943-0663,1943-0671,,IEEE EMBED SYST LETT,IEEE Embed.

To assess the potential of autonomous low-cost UAVs for the mapping and monitoring of alpine glaciers, we conducted multiple aerial surveys on the Kanderfirn in the Swiss Alps in 2017 and 2018 using open hardware and software of the Paparazzi UAV project. The open-source photogrammetry software OpenDroneMap was tested for the generation of high-resolution orthophotos and digital surface models (DSMs) from aerial imagery and cross-checked with the well-established proprietary software Pix4D. Accurately measured ground control points served for the determination of the geometric accuracy of the orthophotos and DSMs. A horizontal (xy) accuracy of 0.7-1.2 m and a vertical (z) accuracy of 0.7-2.1 m was achieved for OpenDroneMap, compared to a xy-accuracy of 0.3-0.5 m and a z-accuracy of 0.4-0.5 m obtained for Pix4D. Based on the analysis and comparison of different orthophotos and DSMs, surface elevation, roughness and brightness changes from 3 June to 29 September 2018 were quantified. While the brightness of the glacier surface decreased linearly over the ablation season, the surface roughness increased. The mean DSM-based elevation change across the glacier tongue was 8 m, overestimating the measured melting and surface lowering at the installed ablation stakes by about 1.5 m. The presented results highlight that self-built fixed-wing UAVs in tandem with open-source photogrammetry software are an affordable alternative to commercial remote-sensing platforms and proprietary software. The applied low-cost approach also provides great potential for other regions and geoscientific disciplines.","[Groos, Alexander R.; Bertschinger, Thalia J.; Kummer, Celine M.; Munz, Lukas] Univ Bern, Inst Geog, Hallerstr 12, CH-3012 Bern, Switzerland; [Erlwein, Sabrina] Tech Univ Munich, Chair Strateg Landscape Planning & Management, Emil Ramann Str 6, D-85354 Freising Weihenstephan, Germany; [Philipp, Andreas] Univ Augsburg, Inst Geog, Univ Str 10, D-86135 Augsburg, Germany",University of Bern; Technical University of Munich; University of Augsburg,"Groos, AR (corresponding author), Univ Bern, Inst Geog, Hallerstr 12, CH-3012 Bern, Switzerland.",alexander.groos@giub.unibe.ch,"Philipp, Andreas/B-1670-2009","Erlwein, Sabrina/0000-0002-7599-560X; Groos, Alexander Raphael/0000-0002-9379-0333",,,,,56,26,28,4,19,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2076-3263,,GEOSCIENCES,Geosciences,AUG,2019,9,8,,,,,,,356,10.3390/geosciences9080356,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/geosciences9080356,,,21,"Geosciences, Multidisciplinary",Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI),Geology,IT6KA,,"Green Published, Green Submitted, gold",,,8/15/24,WOS:000482981000015,,0,2455,,0,H

Its applications include perception, learning, memory, language, decision making and neural network mapping. Recently, interest has surged in extending EEG measurements to domestic environments. However, the high costs associated with traditional laboratory EEG systems have hindered accessibility for many individuals and researchers in education, research, and medicine. To tackle this, a mobile-EEG device named ""DreamMachine"" was developed. A more affordable alternative to both lab-based EEG systems and existing mobile-EEG devices. This system boasts 24 channels, 24-bit resolution, up to 6 h of battery life, portability, and a low price. Our open-source and open-hardware approach empowers cognitive neuroscience, especially in education, learning, and research, opening doors to more accessibility. This paper introduces the DreamMachine's design and compares it with the lab-based EEG system ""asalabTM"" in an eyes-open and eyes-closed experiment. The Alpha band exhibited higher power in the power spectrum during eyes-closed conditions, whereas the eyes-open condition showed increased power specifically within the Delta frequency range.

The design of this device included the study of the photometric technique for light emission and the development of a software that allows monitoring the dye degradation process. Open-source hardware platforms, such as Arduino, were used for the monitoring system, which have the advantages of being low-cost platforms.

In this way datasets could be complemented, extended and expanded in size with, for example, more individuals, samples and human actions. For this to be possible some commitments must be made by the collaborators, being one of them sharing the same data acquisition platform. In this paper, we offer an affordable open source hardware and software platform based on inertial wearable sensors in a way that several groups could cooperate in the construction of datasets through common software suitable for collaboration.

In the past decade various open source syringe pump designs have accelerated scientific research and exploration by reducing costs and introducing new ideas. To further expand the capabilities of open source syringe pumps we introduce a novel syringe pump design, the Ystruder. It features a load cell to monitor the piston force. This capability enables clog detection as well as development of advanced dosing algorithms. The Ystruder can be monitored wirelessly through a browser-based interface that is integrated into the embedded system. The design is modular and simple which facilitates different syringe and motor configurations, to meet a wide range of use cases. Finally, the Ystruder is not limited to functioning solely as a pump as it can be integrated into a wide range of devices such as three-dimensional motion systems. Here the dosing accuracy and repeatability of the Ystruder are quantified, and we demonstrate its functionality both as a syringe pump and a paste extruder for 3D printing. (C) 2019 The Authors.

In this paper, we propose strategies for the placement of CU and DU network functions in the regional and edge O-Cloud nodes while jointly associating the users to RUs. The aim is to minimize the end-to-end delay of users and minimize the cost of O-RAN deployment. Thus, we first formulate the end-to-end delay, the cost, and the constraints. We then model the problem as a multi-objective optimization problem The optimization formulation consists of a huge number of constraints and variables. To provide a solution to the problem, we develop the corresponding Markov Decision Problem (MDP) and propose a Deep Q-Network (DQN)-based algorithm. The simulation results demonstrate that our proposed scheme reduces the average user delay up to 40% and the deployment cost up to 20% with respect to our baselines.","[Joda, Roghayeh; Pamuklu, Turgay; Iturria-Rivera, Pedro Enrique; Erol-Kantarci, Melike] Univ Ottawa, Sch Elect Engn & Comp Sci, Ottawa, ON K1N 6N5, Canada; [Joda, Roghayeh] Ericsson Canada, Ottawa, ON K2K 2V6, Canada",University of Ottawa; Ericsson,"Erol-Kantarci, M (corresponding author), Univ Ottawa, Sch Elect Engn & Comp Sci, Ottawa, ON K1N 6N5, Canada.",roghayeh.joda@ericsson.com; turgay.pamuklu@uottawa.ca; pitur008@uottawa.ca; melike.erolkantarci@uottawa.ca,"pamuklu, turgay/AAO-2127-2020; Joda, Roghayeh/AAM-6483-2021; Iturria Rivera, Pedro Enrique/JXN-4857-2024","pamuklu, turgay/0000-0003-1444-8263; Joda, Roghayeh/0000-0002-1273-8067; Iturria Rivera, Pedro Enrique/0000-0002-8757-2639; Erol-Kantarci, Melike/0000-0001-6787-8457",NSERC Canada Research Chairs Program,NSERC Canada Research Chairs Program(Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)),This work is supported by the NSERC Canada Research Chairs Program.

Much has been accomplished in the ensuing two decades. Disparate and sometimes divergent developments that had been previously explored at individual private and public universities were finally centralized with increased efficiency and coherency of effort. The stated mission of the ANSS is to ""... provide accurate and timely data and information products for seismic events, including their effects on buildings and structures, employing modern monitoring methods and technologies."" In this article, an approach (xQuake) is proposed that does not interfere in any way with the mission of the National Earthquake Information Center and ANSS but instead restores much of the community focus and international collaboration that has been lost over the past two decades. xQuake uses an executable graph framework in a pipeline architecture; this framework can be seamlessly integrated into current ANSS quake monitoring systems. This newapproach incorporatesmodern approaches to computer analytics, including multitopic Kafka exchange rings, cloud computing, a self-configuring phase associator, and machine learning. The xGraph system is free for noncommercial use, open source, hardware agnostic (Windows, Linux, Mac), with no requirement for commercial datastores.","[Johnson, Caryl Erin] Introspect Syst LLC, Portland, ME 04101 USA",,"Johnson, CE (corresponding author), Introspect Syst LLC, Portland, ME 04101 USA.",caryl.johnson@introspectivesystems.com,,,,,,,16,3,5,0,3,SEISMOLOGICAL SOC AMER,ALBANY,"400 EVELYN AVE, SUITE 201, ALBANY, CA 94706-1375 USA",0895-0695,1938-2057,,SEISMOL RES LETT,Seismol.

Low-cost gas metal arc wire (GMAW)-based 3-D printing enables wire arc additive manufacturing (WAAM) for near net shape applications, but has limited resolution due to the complexities of the arcing process. To begin to monitor and thus control these complexities, the initial designs of the open source GMAW 3-D printer have evolved to include current and voltage monitoring. Building on this prior work, in this study, the design, fabrication and use of the open source arc analyzer is described. The arc analyzer is a multi-sensor monitoring system for quantifying the processing during WAAM, which includes voltage, current, sound, light intensity, radio frequency, and temperature data outputs. The open source arc analyzer is tested here on aluminum WAAM by varying wire feed rate and measuring the resultant changes in the sensor data. Visual inspection and microstructural analysis of the printed samples looking for the presence of porosity are used as the physical indicators of quality. The value of the sensors was assessed and the most impactful sensors were found to be the light and radio frequency sensors, which showed arc extinction events and a characteristic ""good weld"" peak frequency.

Currently, as no commercial continuum robot platform is available, a large variety of early-stage prototypes exists. These prototypes are developed by individual research groups and are often used for a single publication. Thus, a significant amount of time is devoted to creating proprietary hardware and software hindering the development of a common platform, and shifting away scarce time and efforts from the main research challenges. We address this problem by proposing an open-source actuation module, which can be used to build different types of continuum robots. It consists of a high-torque brushless electric motor, a high resolution optical encoder, and a low-gear-ratio transmission. For this article, we create three different types of continuum robots. In addition, we illustrate, for the first time, that continuum robots built with our actuation module can proprioceptively detect external forces. Consequently, our approach opens untapped and under-investigated research directions related to the dynamics and advanced control of continuum robots, where sensing the generalized flow and effort is mandatory. Besides that, we democratize continuum robots research by providing open-source software and hardware with our initiative called the Open Continuum Robotics Project, to increase the accessibility and reproducibility of advanced methods.","[Grassmann, Reinhard M.; Shentu, Chengnan; Hamoda, Taqi; Dewi, Puspita Triana; Burgner-Kahrs, Jessica] Univ Toronto, Dept Math Computat Sci, Continuum Robot Lab, Mississauga, ON, Canada",University of Toronto,"Grassmann, RM (corresponding author), Univ Toronto, Dept Math Computat Sci, Continuum Robot Lab, Mississauga, ON, Canada.",reinhard.grassmann@utoronto.ca,,,Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada10.13039/501100000038,Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada10.13039/501100000038,"The original version of this article, prior to peer review, can be found as a preprint here (Grassmann et al., 2023).",,39,3,3,13,14,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,LAUSANNE,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",2296-9144,,,FRONT ROBOT AI,Front.

Radio-frequency identification (RFID) tags represent some of the smallest animal-borne technologies available. They are frequently used for understanding fine-scale associations between animals and their environments. However, currently available devices are often prohibitively expensive or difficult to customise. 2. We present 'WildWID', an open-source radio-frequency identification system that can be used for detecting encounters between tags and loggers and/or integrated into more advanced experimental set-ups for triggering audio or visual playbacks following the detection of RFID tag codes. WildWID systems can be made using commercially available components (costing similar to$20 USD for tags and similar to$60 for loggers) and can be customised to fit project and species-specific needs. 3. WildWID tags have been deployed on a range of species including koalas Phascolarctos cinereus, lions Panthera leo and shy albatross Thalassarche cauta for a range of research topics, including the assessment of road-crossing structures and species' responses to intraspecific competitors. 4. WildWID is a cost-effective RFID system that can increase the accessibility of this technology for a wider range of researchers and study questions. Its use provides researchers with opportunities to mitigate ethical concerns, for example, by customising systems for species-specific conditions, and its customisability extends the range of applications where RFID systems can be used by field biologists.","[Rafiq, Kasim] Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Environm Studies Dept, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA; [Rafiq, Kasim; Radford, Cameron; Jordan, Neil R.] Botswana Predator Conservat, Maun, Botswana; [Appleby, Rob G.; Dexter, Cathryn E.; Jones, Darryl N.; Blacker, Amy R.

Recently, they have begun to embrace Google's Android operating system to leverage its software ecosystem. Despite the encouraging progress, a challenging issue arises: a majority of Android applications are written in native languages and need to be recompiled to target new hardware platforms. Unfortunately, this recompilation process is not scalable because of the explosion of new hardware platforms. To address this issue, we presentWasmAndroid, a high-performance cross-platform runtime for native Android applications. WithWasmAndroid, developers can compile their source code toWebAssembly, an efficient and portable bytecode format that can be executed everywhere without additional reconfiguration. Developers can also transpile existing application binaries to WebAssembly when source code is not available. WebAssembly's language model is very different from other common languages. This mismatch leads to many unique implementation challenges. In this article, we provide workable solutions and conduct a thorough system evaluation. We show thatWasmAndroid provides acceptable performance to execute native applications in a cross-platform manner.","[Wen, Elliott; Weber, Gerald; Nanayakkara, Suranga] Univ Auckland, 70 Symonds St, Auckland, New Zealand",University of Auckland,"Wen, E (corresponding author), Univ Auckland, 70 Symonds St, Auckland, New Zealand.",jq.elliott.wen@gmail.com; g.weber@aucklanduni.ac.nz; suranga@ahlab.org,,"NANAYAKKARA, SURANGA/0000-0001-7441-5493",,,,,45,0,0,1,7,ASSOC COMPUTING MACHINERY,NEW YORK,"1601 Broadway, 10th Floor, NEW YORK, NY USA",1539-9087,1558-3465,,ACM T EMBED COMPUT S,ACM Trans.

A gate, such as a door, can have a lock mechanism for securing the area from unauthorized access. Most commercial solutions for access control management offer pre-packaged software systems where customization of the authorization logic is either not allowed or subject to payment. Moreover, cross-platform development is a barrier for solution providers due to the high cost of development and maintenance that it implies. To overcome these limitations and further optimize the entire access control systems development process, we propose a model-driven approach that supports automatic code generation to enable communication between an IoT infrastructure and platforms for Facility Access Management. Specifically, the approach combines the benefits of Near-Field Communication (NFC) and Tinkerforge (i.e., an open-source hardware platform) with model-driven techniques. This allows the approach to exploit both behavioral and structural models for the modeling and the consequent code generation of part of the authorization mechanism, thus providing complete coverage of the code generated for the whole system. We implemented and evaluated our approach in a real-world case study within the premises of a fitness center with an IoT infrastructure consisting of several heterogeneous sensors by showing its practical applicability. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in supporting abstraction and automation concerning traditional code-centric development through code generation features. Consequently, our approach makes the whole development process less time-consuming and error-prone, thus reducing the system's time to market.","[De Sanctis, Martina; Iovino, Ludovico; Rossi, Maria Teresa] Gran Sasso Sci Inst, Comp Sci Sci Area, I-67100 Laquila, Italy; [Di Salle, Amleto] European Univ Rome, Human Sci Dept, I-00163 Rome, Italy",Gran Sasso Science Institute (GSSI); European University of Rome,"Iovino, L (corresponding author), Gran Sasso Sci Inst, Comp Sci Sci Area, I-67100 Laquila, Italy.",martina.desanctis@gssi.it; amleto.disalle@unier.it; ludovico.iovino@gssi.it; mariateresa.rossi@gssi.it,,"Rossi, Maria Teresa/0000-0003-0273-7324; Iovino, Ludovico/0000-0001-6552-2609; DI SALLE, AMLETO/0000-0002-0163-9784",Gran Sasso Science Institute- GSSI within the CRUI-CARE Agreement,Gran Sasso Science Institute- GSSI within the CRUI-CARE Agreement,Open access funding provided by Gran Sasso Science Institute- GSSI within the CRUI-CARE Agreement.,,58,0,0,0,4,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1433-2779,1433-2787,,INT J SOFTW TOOLS TE,Int.

In this way, during last decade the deployment of sensing devices has increased considerably in the field of agriculture. This fact has led to a new concept called smart agriculture, and it contemplates activities such as field monitoring, which offer support to make decisions or perform actions, such as irrigation or fertilization. Apart from sensing devices, which use the Internet protocol to transfer data (Internet of Things), there are the so-called crop models, which are able to provide added value over the data provided by the sensors, with the aim of providing recommendations to farmers in decision-making and thus, increase the quality and quantity of their production. In this scenario, the current work uses a low-cost sensorized platform, capable of monitoring meteorological phenomena following the Internet of Things paradigm, with the goal to apply an alert disease model on the cultivation of the vine. The edge computing paradigm is used to achieve this objective; also our work follows some advances from GIScience to increase interoperability. An example of this platform has been deployed in a vineyard parcel located in the municipality of Vilafames (Castello, Spain). (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc.

In this regard, this concept paper introduces the Smart Drifter Cluster: an innovative approach that leverages modern ""consumer"" IoT technologies and notions. This approach enables the remote acquisition of information on Lagrangian transport and important ocean variables, similar to standard drifters. However, it offers potential benefits such as reduced hardware costs, minimal maintenance expenses, and significantly lower power consumption compared to systems relying on independent drifters with satellite communication. By combining low power consumption with an optimized, compact integrated marine photovoltaic system, the drifters achieve unlimited operational autonomy. With the introduction of these new characteristics, the Smart Drifter Cluster goes beyond its primary function of mesoscale monitoring of marine currents. It becomes readily applicable to numerous civil applications, including recovering individuals and materials at sea, addressing pollutant spills, and tracking the dispersion of marine litter. An additional advantage of this remote monitoring and sensing system is its open-source hardware and software architecture. This fosters a citizen-science approach, enabling citizens to replicate, utilize, and contribute to the improvement of the system. Thus, within certain constraints of procedures and protocols, citizens can actively contribute to the generation of valuable data in this critical field.","[Merlino, Silvia; Bianucci, Marco] Consiglio Nazl Ric ISMAR CNR, Ist Sci Marine, I-19032 Lerici, SP, Italy; [Calabro, Vincenzo; Marini, Lorenzo; Pagliai, Marco] MDM TEAM Srl, I-50121 Florence, Italy; [Giannelli, Carlotta; Sacco, Lorenzo] Univ Florence, Dept Math & Informat Ulisse Dini, I-50134 Florence, Italy",Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche (CNR); Istituto di Scienze Marine (ISMAR-CNR); University of Florence,"Bianucci, M (corresponding author), Consiglio Nazl Ric ISMAR CNR, Ist Sci Marine, I-19032 Lerici, SP, Italy.",silvia.merlino@sp.ismar.cnr.it; vincenzo.calabro@mdmteam.eu; carlotta.giannelli@unifi.it; lorenzo.marini@mdmteam.eu; marco.pagliai@mdmteam.eu; lorenzo.sacco@unifi.it; marco.bianucci@cnr.it,"Bianucci, Marco/N-7163-2015; Giannelli, Carlotta/G-2093-2014; MERLINO, SILVIA/O-2325-2015","Bianucci, Marco/0000-0002-0276-2813; SACCO, LORENZO/0000-0003-2458-5421; Giannelli, Carlotta/0000-0002-5137-1405; MERLINO, SILVIA/0000-0002-4537-2903",European Union [101000825],European Union(European Union (EU)),"This research was funded by the European Union through the project M.A.R.T.A.: SVILUPPO DI UNA INNOVATIVA MULTIPIATTAFORMA SMART DRIFTER-UMV-SAPR PER INDAGINI MARINE, POR CreO FESR Toscana 2014-2020, Call R&S 2020, Activity 1.1.5.a1.

OpenPMU achieves this through open-source hardware design specifications and software source code, allowing duplicates of the OpenPMU to be fabricated under open-source licenses. This paper presents the OpenPMU device based on the Labview development environment. The device is performance tested according to the IEEE C37.118.1 standard. Compatibility with the IEEE C37.118.2 messaging format is achieved through middleware which is readily adaptable to other PMU projects or applications. Improvements have been made to the original design to increase its flexibility.

Filling in the remain-der must by necessity be a multimodal effort, with traditional ocean mapping technologies such as crewed survey ships with multibeam echosounders being mixed with newer systems such as uncrewed, sail-powered mapping systems. Volunteer data from any ship with an echosounder can also be used, but although there have been commercial efforts in this field, most of these systems do not contribute data into the public arena and public entities have largely avoided this field due to the complexities of costs, data processing, and uncertainty on how to handle the effort. This article describes the design of an end-to-end system for managed volunteer bathymetric collection consisting of an inexpensive (similar to$20) wireless ""Ocean of Things"" data logger for NMEA0183 and NMEA2000 data, associated firmware to manage the collection, a mobile device application to offload, aggregate, and transfer the data into the cloud, and a cloud segment to pro-cess the data and submit it to an international data repository. All of the design has been released under an Open Hardware or Open Source license, allowing independent organizations to initi-ate data collection efforts without having to do any of the design work themselves.

Depending on the specific requirements of the desired application (bare embedded computer, RS232 serial port connector, IP65 certified casing and connectors) the needed investment ranges from about 95 (sis) up to 200 (sis). The embedded computer runs an open source Linux operating system and can in principle be used to run any kind of software needed for communicating with the laboratory device. Here the open source SiLA2 standard is used for presenting the device's functions in the network. As an example the digital integration of a magnetic stirrer is shown and can be used as a template for other applications. A method for easy remote integration of the device to ensure an easy and consistent workflow in development, testing and usage is also presented.

In science, technology, engineering and mathematics, it is important that practical training be an integral part of the curriculum. Laborem project developed at the technological university institute in Bayonne, France, enables undergraduate students to carry out part of their lab experiments in electronics remotely. Started in 2011, Laborem platform was based on proprietary solutions. Since 2017, the platform has migrated to open source software (PyScada) and open source interface box (Laborem Box), which was developed in order to enable the connection of several circuit boards to be studied. These boards, called plugs, are easily interchangeable and enable teachers to quickly adapt the proposed circuits to their course. The software also provides a simple front panel to adapt the human machine interface that is available for students. Laborem Box consists of a 3D printable box, a power supply board, a set of plugs, and a motherboard that enables students to study the selected plug. In addition, a single board computer is embedded and a hard disk can be used if necessary.

The final prototype included several participative modules, going from an assessment of the history of local soils to measuring heavy metals such as Arsenic and Copper.

In addition, 11 people took part in an experiment in which they had to implement several exercises and complete a usability test. Sampling rates under 250 Hz (typical for many biomedical applications) makes it feasible to implement filters, sliding windows and Fourier analysis, operating in real time. Participants rated software usability at 70.2 out of 100 and the ease of use when implementing several signal processing applications was rated at just over 4.4 out of 5. Participants showed their intention of using this software because it was percieved as useful and very easy to use. The performances of the library showed that it may be appropriate for implementing small biomedical real-time applications or for human movement monitoring, even in a simple open-source hardware device like Arduino Genuino.

The system is designed to use readily accessible vertically-mounted conduit and steel cables and be built with common hand tools so that it is easily replicable in remote areas and the developing world. It can be assembled and deployed in half an hour and easily dissembled and flat-packed for transport. The system can be fabricated for less than commercial racks and is completely customizable in terms of tilt angle and size. The racking system is designed to resist light to moderate wind loads consistent with everyday breezes rather than those commonly used for structural design which are based on extreme events; as it is assumed the racking system will be disassembled and stowed prior to an extreme wind event.

This automatic levelling system is presented as an evolution of actual systems, which uses a new ultrasound sensing system. Design/methodology/approach - After obtaining a prototype, different tests were conducted for getting a system which solves the level plate problem and can be mounted in any FDM AM machine. Several benchmark models were obtained and compared with current equipment concepts for the validity of the product. Findings - All tests were performed with high accuracy, enabling the production of geometries that could not have been achieved without this novel system. Practical implications - This development will enable experienced users to set aside the problems of calibration and focus on the purpose of this type of machines, making prototypes. Originality/value - A system architecture has been developed and integrated into an open hardware AM system, allowing real-time adjustment of the plate during each layer, thus eliminating the need of levelling the plate, allowing to achieve easier printing, and without increasing the cost significantly.","[Soriano Heras, Enrique; Blaya Haro, Fernando; de Agustin del Burgo, Jose Maria; Islan Marcos, Manuel Enrique] Univ Politecn Madrid, ETSIDI, Madrid, Spain",Universidad Politecnica de Madrid,"Heras, ES (corresponding author), Univ Politecn Madrid, ETSIDI, Madrid, Spain.",enrique.soriano@upm.es,"Heras, Enrique Soriano/O-6126-2018; Islán, Manuel/KLZ-7400-2024; Haro, Fernando Blaya/V-7378-2017","Heras, Enrique Soriano/0000-0003-3309-7518; Islán, Manuel/0000-0002-5488-3705; Haro, Fernando Blaya/0000-0001-9151-9067",,,,,25,11,12,2,24,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1355-2546,1758-7670,,RAPID PROTOTYPING J,Rapid Prototyping J.,,2017,23,2,,,,,401,413,,10.1108/RPJ-06-2015-0065,http://dx.doi.org/10.1108/RPJ-06-2015-0065,,,13,"Engineering, Mechanical; Materials Science, Multidisciplinary",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Engineering; Materials Science,EX0UT,,,,,8/15/24,WOS:000402937000019,,0,2481,,0,H

Currently, many emerging contaminants are difficult to measure with no field deployable sensors currently available. Hence, discrete grab samples are required for subsequent laboratory analysis. To capture the spatiotemporal variability in pollution pulses, autosamplers can be used, but commercial offerings are both expensive and have a large footprint. This can be problematic in urban environments where there is a high density of point source inputs and risk of vandalism or theft. Here, we present a small and robust low-cost autosampler that is ideally suited for deployment in urban environments. The design is based on ""off the shelf"" open-source hardware components and software and requires no prior engineering, electronics, or computer programming experience to build. The autosampler uses a small peristaltic pump to enable collection of 14 small volume samples (50 mL) and is housed in a small footprint camera case. To illustrate the technology, we present two use cases for rapid sampling of stormwater pulses of: 1) an urban river channel and 2) green roof runoff. When compared with a commercial autosampler, our device showed comparable results and enabled us to capture temporal dynamics in key water quality parameters (e.g., dissolved organic matter) following rain events in an urban stream. Water quality differences associated with differing green roof design/maintenance regimes (managed and unmanaged vegetation) were captured using the autosampler, highlighting how unmanaged vegetation has a greater potential for mitigating the rapid runoff and peaked pollutant inputs associated with impervious surfaces. These two case studies show that our portable autosampler provides capacity to improve understanding of the impact of urban design and infrastructure on water quality and can lead to the development of more effective mitigation solutions. Finally, we discuss opportunities for further technical refinement of our autosampler and applications to improve environmental monitoring. We propose a holistic monitoring approach to address some of the outstanding challenges in urban areas and enable monitoring to shift from discrete point sources towards characterization of catchment or network scale dynamics.","[Khamis, Kieran; Ouellet, Valerie; Croghan, Danny; Hannah, David M.; Krause, Stefan] Univ Birmingham, Sch Geog Earth & Environm Sci, Birmingham, England; [Khamis, Kieran; Ouellet, Valerie; Croghan, Danny; Hannah, David M.; Krause, Stefan] Inst Global Innovat, Birmingham, England; [Gonzalez, Liliana M.

Due to their ease, capability and reliability compared to other conventional injectable medical devices, the market and manufacturing demand for autoinjector devices are increasing rapidly and expected to reach a market of $37.5 billion globally by 2025. Although autoinjectors can offset healthcare treatment costs through self-administered medication, they can be expensive for consumers, which limit their accessibility. This study describes the design and manufacture of a spring-driven and 3-D printed autoinjector to overcome this economic accessibility challenge. The digitally replicable device is released as open-source hardware to enable low-cost distributed manufacturing. The bill of materials and assembly instructions are detailed, and the effectiveness of the autoinjector is tested against the current standard (ISO 11608-1:2022) for needle-based injection systems. The safety and dosing accuracy was tested by measuring the weight of 100% ethyl alcohol expelled from six BD Insulin syringes with varying capacities or needle lengths. A one-way analysis assessed the variability between the dose delivery efficiency of 1mL, 0.5mL, and 0.3mL syringes. Testing indicated that the entire dose was delivered over 97.5% of the time for 1mL and 0.5mL syringes, but the autoinjector's loaded spring force and size exceeded structural limitations of 0.3mL or smaller syringes. Components can be manufactured in about twelve hours using an open-source desktop RepRap-class fused filament 3-D printer. The construction requires two compression springs and 3-D printed parts. The total material cost of CAD$6.83 is less than a tenth of comparable commercial autoinjectors, which makes this approach promising. The autoinjector, however, is a class two medical device and must be approved by regulators. Future work is needed to make distributed manufacturing of such medical devices feasible and reliable to support individuals burdened by healthcare costs.","[Selvaraj, Anjutha] Western Univ, Fac Sci Med Sci & Environm Sci, London, ON, Canada; [Kulkarni, Apoorv; Pearce, J.

Free and open source software and firmware are developed to operate the tool. The OS4PP was validated against a wide range of discrete resistors and indium tin oxide (ITO) samples of different thicknesses both pre- and post-annealing. The OS4PP was then compared to two commercial proprietary systems. Results of resistors from 10 to 1 M show errors of less than 1% for the OS4PP. The 3-D mapping of sheet resistance of ITO samples successfully demonstrated the automated capability to measure non-uniformities in large-area samples. The results indicate that all measured values are within the same order of magnitude when compared to two proprietary measurement systems. In conclusion, the OS4PP system, which costs less than 70% of manual proprietary systems, is comparable electrically while offering automated 100 micron positional accuracy for measuring sheet resistance over larger areas.","[Chandra, Handy; Allen, Spencer W.; Oberloier, Shane W.; Pearce, Joshua M.] Michigan Technol Univ, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, Houghton, MI 49931 USA; [Bihari, Nupur; Gwamuri, Jephias; Pearce, Joshua M.] Michigan Technol Univ, Dept Mat Sci & Engn, Houghton, MI 49931 USA",Michigan Technological University; Michigan Technological University,"Pearce, JM (corresponding author), Michigan Technol Univ, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, Houghton, MI 49931 USA.; Pearce, JM (corresponding author), Michigan Technol Univ, Dept Mat Sci & Engn, Houghton, MI 49931 USA.",handyc@mtu.edu; swallen@mtu.edu; swoberlo@mtu.edu; nbihari@mtu.edu; jgwamuri@mtu.edu; pearce@mtu.edu,"Gwamuri, Jephias/AAA-2383-2020; Pearce, Joshua/D-2052-2010","Pearce, Joshua/0000-0001-9802-3056; Gwamuri, Jephias/0000-0003-1806-6799; Oberloier, Shane/0000-0002-2727-9713",Fulbright program,Fulbright program,The authors would like to acknowledge support from the Fulbright program during the whole course of this work.,,69,25,28,1,15,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,1996-1944,,MATERIALS,Materials,FEB,2017,10,2,,,,,,,110,10.3390/ma10020110,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ma10020110,,,17,"Chemistry, Physical; Materials Science, Multidisciplinary; Metallurgy & Metallurgical Engineering; Physics, Applied; Physics, Condensed Matter",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Chemistry; Materials Science; Metallurgy & Metallurgical Engineering; Physics,EM6TT,28772471,"Green Published, gold",,,8/15/24,WOS:000395445800017,,0,2484,,0,H

The Cereberus successfully prints polyetherketoneketone (PEKK) and polyetherimide (PEI, ULTEM) with tensile strengths of 77.5 and 80.5 MPa, respectively. As a case study, open source face masks were 3-D printed in PEKK and shown not to warp upon widely home-accessible oven-based sterilization. (C) 2020 The Author(s).

In the Warehouses, if the user wants to locate any product it is very difficult, because user have to do a detailed search manually in all the available stockrooms this requires a lot of effort. So to avoid this problem the warehouse inventory management system is very helpful because it maintains the detailed product information and tells us in which stockroom the product is present. The warehouse inventory management system is playing a significant aspect in many productions and goods based methodology. Though there are many wireless communication technologies the RFID suits the best for the warehouse inventory management system. The tag information is transferred from the transmitter section to open source hardware via a wireless link with the aid of internet. The warehouse inventory management system built on the architecture of the Internet of Things is developed to track the products attached to the tags with product information and their respective time stamps for further verification. The Raspberry Pi acts as a central server, monitoring all the information. The total system gives an archetype to correspond the information flow and material flow.

We designed a position-independent differencing algorithm to robustly handle language constructs whose relative orderings do not matter. This paper presents Vdiff, an instantiation of this position-independent differencing algorithm for Verilog HDL. To help programmers reason about the differences at a high-level, Vdiff outputs syntactic differences in terms of Verilog-specific change types. The quantitative evaluation of Vdiff on two open source hardware design projects shows that Vdiff is very accurate, with overall 96.8 % precision and 97.3 % recall when using manually classified differences as a basis of comparison. Vdiff is also fast and scalable-it processes the entire revision history of nine open projects all under 5.35 minutes. We conducted a user study with eight hardware design experts to understand how the program differences identified by the experts match Vdiff's output. The study results show that Vdiff's output is better aligned with the experts' classification of Verilog changes than an existing textual program differencing tool.","[Kim, Miryung] Univ Texas Austin, Austin, TX 78712 USA; [Duley, Adam] ARM Inc, Austin, TX 78746 USA; [Spandikow, Chris] IBM Corp, Austin, TX 78758 USA",University of Texas System; University of Texas Austin; International Business Machines (IBM),"Kim, M (corresponding author), Univ Texas Austin, Austin, TX 78712 USA.",adam.duley@arm.com; spandiko@gmail.com; miryung@ece.utexas.edu,,,"National Science Foundation [CCF-1043810, CCF-1117902, CCF-1149391]; Microsoft SEIF Award; Direct For Computer & Info Scie & Enginr; Division of Computing and Communication Foundations [1043810] Funding Source: National Science Foundation; Division of Computing and Communication Foundations; Direct For Computer & Info Scie & Enginr [1117902, 1533791] Funding Source: National Science Foundation",National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Microsoft SEIF Award(Microsoft); Direct For Computer & Info Scie & Enginr; Division of Computing and Communication Foundations(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Computer & Information Science & Engineering (CISE)); Division of Computing and Communication Foundations; Direct For Computer & Info Scie & Enginr(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Computer & Information Science & Engineering (CISE)),"This research is in part supported by National Science Foundation grants under CCF-1043810, CCF-1117902, and CCF-1149391 and 2011 Microsoft SEIF Award.

This leads to the necessity to adapt old hardware. Most of the microcontrollers used in the old hardware do not offer any support of the new interfaces and have to be replaced. A simple and efficient way is to replace them with open hardware microcontroller boards like the Arduino. These boards are based on 8-bit RISC microcontrollers and offer a software development environment with a large number of libraries.

Open source hardware, in particular, lowers the barrier of entry to new technologies and can further accelerate innovation in robotics. But open hardware is also more difficult to propagate in comparison to open software because it involves replicating physical components, which requires users to have sufficient familiarity and access to fabrication equipment. In this work, we present a review on open robot hardware (ORH) by first highlighting the key benefits and challenges encountered by users and developers of ORH, and then relaying some best practices that can be adopted in developing successful ORH. To accomplish this, we surveyed more than 80 major ORH projects and initiatives across different domains within robotics. Finally, we identify strategies exemplified by the surveyed projects to further detail the development process, and guide developers through the design, documentation, and dissemination stages of an ORH project.","[Patel, Vatsal V.; Dollar, Aaron M.] Yale Univ, Dept Mech Engn & Mat Sci, New Haven, CT 06520 USA; [Liarokapis, Minas V.] Univ Auckland, Dept Mech & Mechatron Engn, New Dexter Res Grp, Auckland 1010, New Zealand",Yale University; University of Auckland,"Patel, VV (corresponding author), Yale Univ, Dept Mech Engn & Mat Sci, New Haven, CT 06520 USA.",v.patel@yale.edu; minas.liarokapis@auckland.ac.nz; aaron.dollar@yale.edu,"Liarokapis, Minas/E-1990-2015","Liarokapis, Minas/0000-0002-6016-1477; Patel, Vatsal/0000-0002-6564-5622","U.S. National Science Foundation [1734190, 1928448]; Directorate For Engineering; Div Of Civil, Mechanical, & Manufact Inn [1928448] Funding Source: National Science Foundation; Div Of Information & Intelligent Systems; Direct For Computer & Info Scie & Enginr [1734190] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","U.S. National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Directorate For Engineering; Div Of Civil, Mechanical, & Manufact Inn(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Engineering (ENG)); Div Of Information & Intelligent Systems; Direct For Computer & Info Scie & Enginr(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Computer & Information Science & Engineering (CISE))",This work was supported by the U.S. National Science Foundation under grants 1734190 and 1928448.,,157,3,3,2,5,IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC,PISCATAWAY,"445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA",1070-9932,1558-223X,,IEEE ROBOT AUTOM MAG,IEEE Robot.

This trend has increased attention to open source hardware (OSH): a phenomenon that extends the intellectual property management and development practices in open source software (OSS) into the design of physical objects. OSH projects are different from OSS projects due to product type, and distinct from traditional closed source new product development (NPD) ones due to their openness. These differences challenge the degree of applicability of existing project success definitions in the OSH context. To investigate project success in OSH, we conducted a qualitative survey with practitioners. We report characteristics of successful OSH projects through three identified themes: (a) value creation - the big-picture impact, (b) quality of output - the quality of the hardware and accompanying documentation and (c) project process - activities that contribute to success. We contextualise by comparing OSH with selected literature on the success of OSS and NPD project management. While our study confirms a similarity between OSS and OSH in defining project success, it also highlights themes that are uniquely important to the latter. These findings are helpful for OSH development practice and could provide lessons for OSS development and closed source NPD.","[Antoniou, Rafaella; Bonvoisin, Jeremy; Hsing, Pen-Yuan; Dekoninck, Elies] Univ Bath, Dept Mech Engn, Bath, Avon, England; [Defazio, Daniela] Univ Bath, Sch Management, Bath, Avon, England",University of Bath; University of Bath,"Antoniou, R (corresponding author), Univ Bath, Dept Mech Engn, Bath, Avon, England.",r.antoniou@bath.ac.uk,"Hsing, Pen-Yuan/JGM-4181-2023; Defazio, Daniela/A-5363-2009","Hsing, Pen-Yuan/0000-0002-5394-879X; Antoniou, Rafaella/0000-0002-3027-0381; Bonvoisin, Jeremy/0000-0003-4146-1607; Defazio, Daniela/0000-0002-8185-4045",European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme [869984]; A.G.

One of the most fundamental questions relating to these phenomena is why developers contribute their private resources to these public goods. While this question has been discussed, theorized, and empirically investigated in the context of OSS, there has been no research so far in the context of OSH. Can we really assume the motivations behind the development of the OSH to be the same as those behind OSS? Based on the self-determination theory (SDT), we provide original insights into the motivations behind contributions to OSH development. We collected data from the most common and active 3D printing communities, which are the main loci of OSH development. We thus have a unique cross-sectional data set with participants from over 30 different countries using all kinds of different OSH platforms. Our analysis reveals several important findings: firstly, the motivations are in some aspects very similar to those in open source software notwithstanding different possibilities, hurdles, and incentives regarding the OSS and OSH. Above all, enjoyment-based intrinsic motivation is a major factor affecting contribution levels. Secondly, among internalized extrinsic motivations, expected private benefits through improving own skills stands out. Thirdly, different factors of internalized extrinsic motivations can have different moderating effects on the effect of enjoyment-based intrinsic motivation. Given the imminent changes in business models throughout manufacturing industries in order to adapt to the challenge that OSH will increasingly pose, our findings have important implications not only for OSH communities and 3D development platforms, but also for businesses that want and probably soon have to engage in open innovation.","[Hausberg, J.

Bonvoisin and Mies (Procedia CIRP 78:388-393, 2018) defined the ""open-o-meter"", i.e. a series of criteria to measure the openness of an OSH project. These criteria fall into two categories: product openness and process openness. The open-o-meter gives clear guidelines on measuring product openness by verifying access to specific types of documents, however the criteria to measure process openness are relatively implicit. In this paper, we propose to measure an OSH project's process openness by identifying different types of collaboration tools in that project. We will evaluate 226 OSH projects' process openness by analysing their usage of collaboration tools, for example social media, wiki, GitHub etc. This empirical study showed that the usage of collaboration tools in OSH projects decreases as the score of open-o-meter decreases, which implies that the open-o-meter measures correctly an OSH project's process openness. This research not only validates open-o-meter, but also offers an explicit way to measure an OSH project's process openness that might be very useful for companies to evaluate potential collaborations.","[Dai, X.; Boujut, J.

While some expect such open-source hardware (OSH) to lead to transformational changes in the ways technologies are produced, the available empirical evidence suggests that, to date, the diffusion of most OSH applications has been modest. In this paper, we focus on the limited uptake of OSH and study factors that help explain its adoption by users who replicate available open-source designs. Given our limited understanding of this topic, we present an in-depth study of small wind turbines based on open designs. Through a systematic review of the case-specific literature, we identify and analyse 60 documents, including case studies, construction manuals, market analyses, and technical assessments. We find that the adoption of available open-source wind turbine designs by technology users depends on a number of factors that are currently underemphasized in discussions on the potential of OSH. This includes the quality of OSH self-manufactured products, the particular motivations of adopters to engage with OSH, the availability of adequate production inputs for local manufacturing, and the resources available through open-source communities.","[Reinauer, Tobias; Hansen, Ulrich Elmer] Tech Univ Denmark, Dept Technol Management & Econ, UNEP DTU Partnership, Lyngby, Denmark",Technical University of Denmark,"Reinauer, T (corresponding author), Marmorvej 51, DK-2100 Copenhagen, Denmark.",tobre@dtu.dk,,"Reinauer, Tobias/0000-0002-0803-0250; Hansen, Ulrich Elmer/0000-0002-8997-6717",European Union [713683],European Union(European Union (EU)),This project has received funding from the European Union's Horizon 2020 Research and Innovation Programme under Marie SkodowskaCurie grant agreement No. 713683.,,125,7,7,6,25,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0166-4972,1879-2383,,TECHNOVATION,Technovation,AUG,2021,106,,,,,,,,102289,10.1016/j.technovation.2021.102289,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.technovation.2021.102289,,21-May,12,"Engineering, Industrial; Management; Operations Research & Management Science",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Engineering; Business & Economics; Operations Research & Management Science,TK4HG,,,,,8/15/24,WOS:000674120800002,,1,5,,1,

As predictions showed that the number of patients would exceed current supply of hospital-grade ventilators, a number of formal (academia, the industry and governments) and informal (fablabs and startups) entities raced to develop cheap, easy-to-fabricate mechanical ventilators. The presence of actors with very diverse modus operandi as well as the speed at which the field has grown, led to a fragmented design space characterized by a lack of clear design patterns, projects not meeting the minimum functional requirements or showing little-to-no innovation; but also valid alternatives to hospital-grade devices. In this paper we provide a taxonomic system to help researchers with no background in biomedical engineering to read, understand and contribute to the OSH-MV field. The taxonomy is composed of ten properties that are read through the lenses of three reflection criteria: buildability, adoptability and scalability. We applied the taxonomy to the analysis of seventeen OSH-MV projects, which are representative of the current landscape of possibilities available for COVID-19 patients. We discuss the different design choices adopted by each project highlighting strengths and weaknesses and we suggest possible directions for the development of the OSH-MV field.

Thus, the purpose of this study is to understand the dynamics of value creation in a local context bringing together research on OSHBMs and the middleground construct.

Codification and personalization also proved to be important KM approaches, both requiring support in the OSH design process. Using a dendrogram, we highlighted the benefits and challenges of codification together with some interesting concept associations.

However, three decades ago, the medical community started to consider repurposing ultrasound scanners to improve physical examinations. A broad community of healthcare professionals trained in the new clinical examination paradigm could not be created due to the very high price of portable ultrasound scanners available on the market. In this paper, we study an Open-Source Hardware (OSH) community that aims to improve diagnosis in hospitals and medically underserved areas worldwide. They are designing an echo-stethoscope - a portable ultrasound scanner - that would be affordable in low and middle-income countries. The variety of expertise pooled to achieve this objective puts this knowledge common (KC) at the crossroads of open-source software (OSS), OSH, and medical communities. Unlike typical KC outcomes, an ultrasound probe is a physical object. Development and innovation in the physical world bring social dilemmas that the community has to overcome, restrictions in terms of openness, and in this case, unintended privatization. Our study uses the governing knowledge common framework (GKCF), a modified institutional analysis and development framework, to untangle the interactions between resources, participants, and governance structures. Our research describes why and how the creation of a physical object subject to industry regulation influences the evolution and governance of the KC. We provide evidence that temporary privatization of the KC can be used as a way to protect and sustain a common during the industrialization phase. We also demonstrate how a portfolio of projects is an effective and resilient way to help the common survive this privatization step.","[Carpentier, Pascal] Erasmus Univ, Rotterdam Sch Management, Rotterdam, Netherlands; [Carpentier, Pascal] Drugs Neglected Dis Initiat, Geneva, Switzerland",Erasmus University Rotterdam - Excl Erasmus MC; Erasmus University Rotterdam,"Carpentier, P (corresponding author), Erasmus Univ, Rotterdam Sch Management, Rotterdam, Netherlands.; Carpentier, P (corresponding author), Drugs Neglected Dis Initiat, Geneva, Switzerland.",pcarpentier@dndi.org,,"Carpentier, Pascal/0000-0002-1483-0377",Drugs for Neglected Diseases initiative (DNDi),Drugs for Neglected Diseases initiative (DNDi),"The Drugs for Neglected Diseases initiative (DNDi) is grateful to its donors, public and private, who have provided funding to DNDi since its inception in 2003.

In doing so, it has started to change not only how physical products are designed and developed, but also the commercialisation process. In recent years, authors have witnessed entrepreneurs intentionally choosing not to patent their product design and technologies but instead licencing the designs and technologies under open-source licences. The entrepreneurs share their product designs online with their community - people who congregated due to the shared interests in products' technology or project's social objectives. Founding a startup firm without excluding others from using their own invention is not a common practice. Therefore, there is reason to ask if this choice a strategic decision or irrational action due to short-sightedness or extreme altruism? Conducting interviews with 65 founders, we grounded a framework explaining that the driver of going open is a result of both intrinsic and extrinsic factors.

In order to facilitate this process, this paper presents a survey focused on the assessment of the ecosystem that entails RISC-V based hardware for creating a classification of system-on-chip (SoC) and CPU cores, along with an inclusive arrangement of the latest released frameworks that have supported open hardware integration for ML applications. Moreover, part of this work is devoted to the challenges that are concerned, such as power efficiency and reliability, when designing and building application with OSH in the AI/ML domain.

Even when in recent years we have seen an explosion of new scientific tools in the field, how these tools reproduce inequalities is underexplored. The open science hardware movement provides an opportunity for studying this question in practice. I present findings from qualitative research with two projects of the Gathering for Open Science Hardware (GOSH) community in Latin America during 2018-2022. These findings show how researchers use open science hardware to overcome structural inequalities in environmental research. Beyond their lower cost, researchers are using open hardware to enable new ideas and concepts to emerge through flexible and repairable designs. I describe four mechanisms that enable the creation of new epistemic resources: autonomy, flexibility, impact and resilience, and I identify significant limitations to this potential. In the context of ongoing policy discussions promoting wider adoption of low-cost environmental research tools, this work provides insights for seizing the transformative potential of openness towards more fair environmental science.","[Arancio, Julieta] Drexel Univ, Ctr Sci Technol & Soc, 3101 Market St, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA",Drexel University,"Arancio, J (corresponding author), Drexel Univ, Ctr Sci Technol & Soc, 3101 Market St, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA.",jca88@drexel.edu,,"Arancio, Julieta C./0000-0002-8624-4182",Alfred P.

Mobile learning has become an essential method that design makers should adopt. The main content of this study is to explore the characteristics of learning behaviors and learning needs of creative design makers' group in forming a community of practice in the era of mobile learning.Design/methodology/approachThis study conducted questionnaire research on the potentially associated or directly associated population of design makers. The process of the study also combined observational and interview studies to compensate for the lack of questionnaire research.FindingsBased on the support of mobile learning technology, design makers share and co-create to achieve individual development and evolution of learning organizations, and produce creative value. Design-maker communities of practice form common communities in the framework of informal organizations to support continuous individual learning. Convergent interests or concerns in making things, real-world contexts based on makerspaces and hands-on practice based on real projects are the basis for forming design-maker communities of practice. A variety of open-source hardware, software and platforms that can support mobile learning are important for the development of design-maker communities of practice. The design-maker community of practice needs group factors, activity development, physical and technical resources, spatial support and institutional norms to enhance learning behaviors and satisfy learning needs.Originality/valueThe discovery and construction of these associated factors can help creative design practitioners form a lasting and virtuous organizational development. This study facilitates the formation of a social network for learning and knowledge sharing among design-maker communities of practice. It enhances the innovation ability and enthusiasm of design makers according to the population characteristics and learning needs of design makers. This study also facilitates the generation of a positive adaptive maker culture and maker spirit within design maker organizations.","[Zhang, Xin; Hu, Jieming] Donghua Univ, Coll Fash & Design, Shanghai, Peoples R China",Donghua University,"Hu, JM (corresponding author), Donghua Univ, Coll Fash & Design, Shanghai, Peoples R China.",792345590@qq.com; 56419823@qq.com,"Hu, Jieming/GRY-5239-2022",,Prosperity Plan Pre-research Project of Donghua University-Multiple Evolution and System Construction of Open Design Maker Co-creation Field; Shanghai Summit Discipline in Design;  [2020Y003];  [DD18003],Prosperity Plan Pre-research Project of Donghua University-Multiple Evolution and System Construction of Open Design Maker Co-creation Field; Shanghai Summit Discipline in Design; ;,The authors thank Huang Haoxiang and Ding Xinyi of Donghua University for their help in this thesis research.

The techniques discussed have in common the use of accessible, community-built technologies for acquiring data. They are also concerned with embedding collaborative and open source principles into the objects, tools, social formations and data sharing practices that emerge from these inquiries. The focus is on developing processes of collaborative design and experimentation through material engagement with technology and issues of concern. Problem-solving, here, is a tactic, while the strategy is an ongoing engagement with the problem of participation in its technological, social and political dimensions especially considering the increasing centralization and specialization of scientific and technological expertise. The authors also discuss and reflect on the Public Lab's approach to civic science in light of ideas and practices of citizen/civic veillance, or ""sousveillance"", by emphasizing people before data, and by investigating the new ways of seeing and doing that this shift in perspective might provide.","[Rey-Mazon, Pablo] Basurama & Montera34, Bilbao, Spain; [Rey-Mazon, Pablo; Dosemagen, Shannon; Blair, Don] Publ Lab Open Technol & Sci, New Orleans, LA USA; [Rey-Mazon, Pablo] Wikitoki, Plaza Cantera 5,2, Bilbao 48003, Spain; [Keysar, Hagit] Tel Aviv Univ, Geog Dept, Planning Environm Communities PECLAB, Tel Aviv, Israel; [D'Ignazio, Catherine] Emerson Coll, Civ Media & Data Visualizat, Boston, MA 02116 USA",Tel Aviv University,"Keysar, H (corresponding author), Tel Aviv Univ, Geog Dept, Planning Environm Communities PECLAB, Tel Aviv, Israel.",pablo@basurama.org; hkeysar@gmail.com; shannon@publiclab.org; catherine_dignazio@emerson.edu; donblair@pvos.org,"DIgnazio, Catherine/IAQ-2205-2023","/0000-0002-8673-1941; Rey-Mazon, Pablo/0000-0002-5859-0467","Education Lab in ""Mamuta, Art and Media Center""","Education Lab in ""Mamuta, Art and Media Center""","Special thanks to Dr. Heidi Ballard, Liz Barry, Shai Efrati, Jeff Warren and Cindy Regalado.

This underlines the importance of having sustainable air quality monitoring solutions that foster inclusion and multi-stakeholder partnerships for social-scientific interventions. This study illustrates how AirBox project has emerged in Taiwan, where makers and citizens use the sensors to sense air quality and provide the public with actionable data about their environments. The AirBox project includes elements of technology-innovation and citizen science: (1) Participatory Sensing ? Static and mobile air quality sensing, (2) Open Data ? Open hardware, software and access to data, (3) Co-creation Citizen Science ? Citizen-led campaigns and forums, and (4) Outreach ? Knowledge sharing, trust building and multi-stakeholder collaboration. The project uses a wide range of sensors to provide extendable solutions and data at fine spatio-temporal resolution. The results are highlighted using five cases studies that show how integrating social dimensions in an air quality monitoring framework can lead to public awareness, data-driven applications and environmentally sustainable cities.

While DIY practice offers the potential for stronger user engagement with physical artifacts, we know little about end users' DIY practice of making complex electronic technologies and their potential to ensure engagement with such devices. In this article, we report on interviews with 18 participants from two green communities who built and used an open source DIY energy monitor, with the aim to explore the end users DIY practices of making such complex electronic devices. Findings indicate four key qualities of DIY monitors: transparent modularity, open-endedness, heirloom, and disruptiveness, and how they contribute to more meaningful engagement with the DIY monitors, elevating them from the status of unremarkable objects to that of things. We conclude with three implications for design for supporting end user development of complex electronic DIY: designing transparent open hardware technologies, standardizing communication protocols for the current and future DIY of IoT, and deliberately calling for personal investment and labor in the assembling of DIY kits.","[Sas, Corina] Univ Lancaster, Sch Comp & Commun, Lancaster LA1 4WA, England; [Neustaedter, Carman] Simon Fraser Univ, Sch Interact Arts Technol, 515 West Hastings St, Vancouver, BC V6B 5K3, Canada",Lancaster University; Simon Fraser University,"Sas, C (corresponding author), Univ Lancaster, Sch Comp & Commun, Lancaster LA1 4WA, England.",,"Sas, Corina/AAG-2837-2021","Sas, Corina/0000-0001-9297-9612","UK Research Council through the Catalyst project, (EPSRC) [EP/I033017/1]; EPSRC [EP/I033017/1] Funding Source: UKRI","UK Research Council through the Catalyst project, (EPSRC)(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)); EPSRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC))","This work was supported by the UK Research Council through the Catalyst project, (EPSRC Grant EP/I033017/1).",,94,26,30,0,12,ASSOC COMPUTING MACHINERY,NEW YORK,"1601 Broadway, 10th Floor, NEW YORK, NY USA",1073-0516,1557-7325,,ACM T COMPUT-HUM INT,ACM Trans.

Snowball sampling was used in this study to survey 300 people who work and have had experiences with online brand communities for open source hardware (OSHW) at Fab Lab Seoul. The findings of this study indicate that content, consumer support, user interface, and reward are among the five factors that trigger an online brand community to develop a social OSHW platform. However, this study also found that brand reputation was insignificant relative to activating a social media platform for open-source software. In addition, activating a social platform for OSHW can positively affect to the brand community's loyalty for OSHW, which means that social platform innovation for OSHW can help form the positive attitude necessary to develop and diffuse an OSHW culture in a rapidly changing ICT ecosystem. This can be an important strategy for OSHW business and can contribute to the growth of the IoT market in South Korea. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Digital manufacturing technologies have only recently become widespread and the return on investment (ROI) was not clear, so funding for open hardware development was historically sparse. This paper clarifies a method for determining an ROI for the development of scientific free and open source hardware (FOSH). By using an open source hardware design that can be manufactured digitally, the relatively minor development costs result in enormous ROIs for the scientific community. A case study is presented of a syringe pump released under open license, which results in ROIs for funders ranging from hundreds to thousands of percent after only a few months.

Early research found substantial economic savings for these technologies, but as the open source design paradigm has grown by orders of magnitude it is possible that the savings observed in the early work was isolated to special cases. Today there are examples of open source technology for science in the vast majority of disciplines and several resources dedicated specifically to publishing them. Do the tremendous economic savings observed earlier hold today? To answer that question, this study evaluates free and open source technologies in the two repositories compared to proprietary functionally-equivalent tools as a function of their use of Arduino-based electronics, RepRap-class 3-D printing, as well as the combination of the two. The results of the review find overwhelming evidence for a wide range of scientific tools, that open source technologies provide economic savings of 87% compared to equivalent or lesser proprietary tools. These economic savings increased slightly to 89% for those that used Arduino technology and even more to 92% for those that used RepRap-class 3-D printing. Combining both Arduino and 3-D printing the savings averaged 94% for free and open source tools over commercial equivalents. The results provide strong evidence for financial support of open source hardware and software development for the sciences. Given the overwhelming economic advantages of free and open source technologies, it appears financially responsible to divert funding of proprietary scientific tools and their development in favor of FOSH. Policies were outlined that provide nations with a template for strategically harvesting the opportunities provided by the free and open source paradigm. (C) 2020 The Author.

This is done through distributed manufacturing, in which products are produced close to end users. There is anecdotal evidence that these opportunities are heavily geographically dependent, with some locations unable to acquire components to build open hardware at accessible prices because of trade restrictions, tariffs, taxes, or market availability. Supply chain disruptions during the COVID-19 pandemic exacerbated this and forced designers to pivot towards a la carte-style design frameworks for critical system components. To further develop this phenomenon, a case study of free and open-source solar photovoltaic (PV) racking systems is provided. Two similar open-source designs made from different materials are compared in terms of capital costs for their detailed bill of materials throughout ten locations in North, Central and South America. The differences in economic optimization showed that the costs of wood-based racks were superior in North America and in some South American countries, while metal was less costly in Central and South America. The results make it clear that open hardware designs would be best to allow for local optimization based on material availability in all designs.","[Rana, Shafquat; Powell, Jadyn; Pearce, Joshua M.] Western Univ, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, London, ON N6A 5B9, Canada; [Vandewetering, Nicholas] Western Univ, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, London, ON N6A 3K7, Canada; [Ariza, Jonathan alvarez] Engn Fac, Dept Technol Elect, Corp Universitaria Minuto Dios UNIMINUTO, Bogota 111021, Colombia; [Pearce, Joshua M.] Western Univ, Ivey Business Sch, London, ON N6G 0N1, Canada",Western University (University of Western Ontario); Western University (University of Western Ontario); Western University (University of Western Ontario),"Pearce, JM (corresponding author), Western Univ, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, London, ON N6A 5B9, Canada.; Pearce, JM (corresponding author), Western Univ, Ivey Business Sch, London, ON N6G 0N1, Canada.",nvandew@uwo.ca; jalvarez@uniminuto.edu,"Pearce, Joshua/C-9240-2013","Pearce, Joshua/0000-0001-9802-3056; Vandewetering, Nicholas/0000-0003-3901-3127; Alvarez Ariza, Jonathan/0000-0002-4024-1349",,,,,126,1,1,3,4,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2227-7080,,TECHNOLOGIES,Technologies,APR,2023,11,2,,,,,,,62,10.3390/technologies11020062,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/technologies11020062,,,17,"Engineering, Multidisciplinary",Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI),Engineering,E8KZ9,,gold,,,8/15/24,WOS:000977980400001,,1,25,,1,

Unfortunately, some 3-D printing manufacturing companies began deviating from open-source principles and violating licenses for the detriment of the community. To determine if a pattern has emerged of companies patenting clearly open-source innovations, this study presents three case studies from the three primary regions of open-source 3-D printing development (EU, U.S., and China) as well as three aspects of 3-D printing technology (AM materials, an open-source 3-D printer, and core open-source 3-D printing concepts used in most 3-D printers). The results of this review have shown that non-inventing entities, called patent parasites, are patenting open-source inventions already well-established in the open-source community and, in the most egregious cases, commercialized by one (or several) firm(s) at the time of the patent filing. Patent parasites are able to patent open-source innovations by using a different language, vague patent titles, and broad claims that encompass enormous swaths of widely diffused open-source innovation space. This practice poses a severe threat to innovation, and several approaches to irradicate the threat are discussed.","[Kulkarni, Apoorv; Pearce, Joshua M.] Western Univ, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, 1151 Richmond St N, London, ON N6A 3K7, Canada; [Pearce, Joshua M.] Western Univ, Ivey Sch Business, 1151 Richmond St N, London, ON N6A 3K7, Canada",Western University (University of Western Ontario); Western University (University of Western Ontario),"Pearce, JM (corresponding author), Western Univ, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, 1151 Richmond St N, London, ON N6A 3K7, Canada.; Pearce, JM (corresponding author), Western Univ, Ivey Sch Business, 1151 Richmond St N, London, ON N6A 3K7, Canada.",apoorv.kulkarni@uwo.ca; joshua.pearce@uwo.ca,"Pearce, Joshua/D-2052-2010","Pearce, Joshua/0000-0001-9802-3056",Thompson Endowment,Thompson Endowment,No Statement Available,,135,0,0,1,1,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2411-5134,,INVENTIONS-BASEL,Inventions,DEC,2023,8,6,,,,,,,141,10.3390/inventions8060141,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/inventions8060141,,,20,"Engineering, Multidisciplinary",Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI),Engineering,DG3W4,,"Green Submitted, gold",,,8/15/24,WOS:001130846400001,,1,26,,1,

Medical devices play an important role in managing acute and chronic respiratory failure, including diagnosis, monitoring, and providing artificial ventilation. Current commercially available respiratory devices are very effective but, given their cost, are unaffordable for most patients in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). Herein, we focus on a relatively new design option-the open-source hardware approach-that, if implemented, will contribute to providing low-cost respiratory medical devices for many patients in LMICs, particularly those without full medical insurance coverage. Open source reflects a set of approaches to conceive and distribute the comprehensive technical information required for building devices. The open-source approach enables free and unrestricted use of the know-how to replicate and manufacture the device or modify its design for improvements or adaptation to different clinical settings or personalized treatments. We describe recent examples of open-source devices for diagnosis/monitoring (measuring inspiratory/expiratory pressures or flow and volume in mechanical ventilators) and for therapy (non-invasive ventilators for adults and continuous positive airway pressure support for infants) that enable building simple, low-cost (hence, affordable), and high-performance solutions for patients in LMICs. Finally, we argue that the common practice of approving clinical trials by the local hospital ethics board can be expanded to ensure patient safety by reviewing, inspecting, and approving open hardware for medical application to maximize the innovation and deployment rate of medical technologies.","[Farre, Ramon] Univ Barcelona, Fac Med & Ciencies Salut, Unitat Biofis & Bioengn, Barcelona 08036, Spain; [Farre, Ramon] CIBER Enfermedades Resp, Madrid 28029, Spain; [Farre, Ramon] Inst Invest Biomed August Pi Sunyer, Barcelona 08036, Spain; [Gozal, David] Univ Missouri, Dept Child Hlth, Sch Med, Columbia, MO 65201 USA; [Viet-Nhung Nguyen] Natl TB Program, 463 Hoang Hoa Tham, Hanoi 118000, Vietnam; [Pearce, Joshua M.] Western Univ, Ivey Business Sch, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, London, ON N6A 5B9, Canada; [Anh Tuan Dinh-Xuan] Hop Cochin, AP HP, Serv Physiol Explorat Fonct, F-75014 Paris, France",University of Barcelona; CIBER - Centro de Investigacion Biomedica en Red; CIBERES; University of Barcelona; Hospital Clinic de Barcelona; IDIBAPS; University of Missouri System; University of Missouri Columbia; Western University (University of Western Ontario); Assistance Publique Hopitaux Paris (APHP); Universite Paris Cite; Hopital Universitaire Cochin - APHP,"Farré, R (corresponding author), Univ Barcelona, Fac Med & Ciencies Salut, Unitat Biofis & Bioengn, Barcelona 08036, Spain.; Farré, R (corresponding author), CIBER Enfermedades Resp, Madrid 28029, Spain.; Farré, R (corresponding author), Inst Invest Biomed August Pi Sunyer, Barcelona 08036, Spain.",rfarre@ub.edu,"DINH-XUAN, Anh Tuan/A-9691-2008; Farre, Ramon/L-2664-2017; Pearce, Joshua/C-9240-2013","DINH-XUAN, Anh Tuan/0000-0001-8651-5176; Gozal, David/0000-0001-8195-6036; Farre, Ramon/0000-0002-9084-7824; Pearce, Joshua/0000-0001-9802-3056",Thompson Endowment andWestern Frugal Biomedical Innovation,Thompson Endowment andWestern Frugal Biomedical Innovation,This research was partially supported by the Thompson Endowment andWestern Frugal Biomedical Innovation.,,80,4,4,1,11,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2075-4426,,J PERS MED,J.

At the thing' leveldevices and inter-device network communicationthe core technical building blocks are generally the same as those found in wireless sensor network implementations. For the Internet of Things to continue growing, we need more plentiful resources for building intelligent devices and sensor networks. Unfortunately, current commercial devices, e.g., sensor nodes and network gateways, tend to be expensive and proprietary, which presents a barrier to entry and arguably slows down further development. There are, however, an increasing number of open embedded platforms available and also a wide selection of off-the-shelf components that can quickly and easily be built into device and network gateway solutions. The question is whether these solutions measure up to built-for-purpose devices. In the paper, we provide a comparison of existing built-for-purpose devices against open source devices. For comparison, we have also designed and rapidly prototyped a sensor node based on off-the-shelf components. We show that these devices compare favorably to built-for-purpose devices in terms of performance, power and cost. Using open platforms and off-the-shelf components would allow more developers to build intelligent devices and sensor networks, which could result in a better overall development ecosystem, lower barriers to entry and rapid growth in the number of IoT applications.","[Fisher, Roy; Kruger, Carel] Univ Pretoria, Adv Sensor Networks Res Grp, ZA-0083 Pretoria, South Africa; [Fisher, Roy; Hancke, Gerhard] City Univ Hong Kong, Dept Comp Sci, Kowloon, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Ledwaba, Lehlogonolo; Kruger, Carel] Council Sci & Ind Res South Africa, Meraka Inst, ZA-0184 Pretoria, South Africa",University of Pretoria; City University of Hong Kong,"Fisher, R (corresponding author), Univ Pretoria, Adv Sensor Networks Res Grp, Lynwood Rd, ZA-0083 Pretoria, South Africa.",rmfisher@cityu.edu.hk; lehlogonolo.ledwaba@yahoo.com; gp.hancke@cityu.edu.hk; ckrugerl@csir.co.za,"Ledwaba, Lehlogonolo P.I./AAR-6732-2021; Hancke, Gerhard/J-7187-2013","Ledwaba, Lehlogonolo P.I./0000-0002-7292-2835; Hancke, Gerhard/0000-0002-2388-3542; Kruger, Carel/0000-0002-7765-1720",City University of Hong Kong [7200375]; National Research Foundation of South Africa [TP1207183332]; Telkom; Bytes Universal Systems; Tellumat; EMC; NRF,City University of Hong Kong(City University of Hong Kong); National Research Foundation of South Africa(National Research Foundation - South Africa); Telkom; Bytes Universal Systems; Tellumat; EMC; NRF,"The work described in the paper was partially supported by a grant from City University of Hong Kong (Project No. 7200375).

However, there is a literature gap concerning wide analysis on different versions and types of Arduino boards, which include software, hardware, and communication vulnerabilities analysis. This work analyzes the software, hardware, and communication vulnerabilities that can be found in different versions of Arduino boards (entry level, enhanced features, IoT-oriented, nonofficial and with Operating System). The results of the analysis show that, in most cases, Arduino boards present hardware and software limitations and security vulnerabilities, probably due to their low-cost requirement design. Some examples are: an easy-to-override firmware, lack of power protection or nonencrypted board communications in the case of Arduino Yun. Also, Arduino does not check bad use of memory stack, so bad memory operations may end up easily on memory corruption and unexpected behavior. All these limitations and vulnerabilities may lead to security breaches on the deployed environment. Therefore, any security management policy must take these weaknesses into account.","[Sainz-Raso, Jorge; Martin, Sergio; Diaz, Gabriel; Castro, Manuel] Univ Nacl Educ Distancia, Madrid, Spain",Universidad Nacional de Educacion a Distancia (UNED),"Martin, S (corresponding author), Univ Nacl Educ Distancia, Madrid, Spain.",jorgesr86@gmail.com; smartin@ieec.uned.es; gdiaz@ieec.uned.es; mcastro@ieec.uned.es,"Martin, Sergio/F-4716-2016; ORUETA, GABRIEL DIAZ/ABF-9707-2020; Castro, Manuel/G-2085-2016","Martin, Sergio/0000-0002-4118-0234; ORUETA, GABRIEL DIAZ/0000-0001-9246-351X; Castro, Manuel/0000-0003-3559-4235","Higher Technical School of Industrial Engineering, Universidad Nacional de Educacion a Distancia (UNED) [2022-ETSII-UNED-11]","Higher Technical School of Industrial Engineering, Universidad Nacional de Educacion a Distancia (UNED)","This work was supported in part by the Higher Technical School of Industrial Engineering, Universidad Nacional de Educacion a Distancia (UNED) under Grant 2022-ETSII-UNED-11.",,48,0,0,0,7,IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC,PISCATAWAY,"445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA",2162-2248,2162-2256,,IEEE CONSUM ELECTR M,IEEE Consum.

The lack of standardization of flight controller architectures and the use of proprietary closed-source flight controllers on many UAV platforms, however, complicates this work: solutions developed for one flight controller may be difficult to port to another without substantial extra development and testing. Using open-source flight controllers mitigates some of these challenges and enables other researchers to validate and build upon existing research.

We argue that produsage is not a model that determines a change in the traditional consumption/production paradigm through a series of essential preconditions (such as open participation, peer-sharing, or common ownership). Rather, we explain produsage as the open-ended result of a series of heterogeneous actor-networking strategies. In this view, the so-called preconditions do not explain produsage but have to be explained along with its establishment as an actor-network. Drawing on this approach, we discuss a case study of an open hardware project: the Arduino board, and we develop a perspective that maps the skills of human and non-human entities in produsage actor-networks, showing how skills are symmetrical, relational, and circulating.","[Storni, Cristiano] Univ Limerick, Interact Design Ctr, Dept Comp Sci & Informat Syst, Limerick, Ireland; [De Paoli, Stefano] Natl Univ Ireland Maynooth, Dept Sociol, Maynooth, Kildare, Ireland; [De Paoli, Stefano] Natl Univ Ireland Maynooth, NIRSA, Maynooth, Kildare, Ireland",University of Limerick; Maynooth University; Maynooth University,"Storni, C (corresponding author), Univ Limerick, Interact Design Ctr, Dept Comp Sci & Informat Syst, Limerick, Ireland.",Cristiano.Storni@ul.ie,,,Irish Higher Education Authority,Irish Higher Education Authority,The authors would like to acknowledge the support of the Irish Higher Education Authority under the PRTLI 4 program (FutureComm project).

Simulation speed becomes even more crucial for agile and open-source hardware design methodologies, because the designers not only want to iterate on designs quicker, but they may also have less resources with which to simulate them. In this article, we execute multiple simulators and analyze them with hardware performance counters. We find some open-source simulators not only outperform a leading commercial simulator, they also achieve comparable or higher instruction throughput on the host processor. Although advanced optimizations may increase the complexity of the simulator, they do not significantly hinder instruction throughput. Our findings make the case that there is significant room to accelerate software simulation and open-source simulators are a great starting point for researchers.","[Beamer, Scott] Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Comp Sci & Engn, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA",University of California System; University of California Santa Cruz,"Beamer, S (corresponding author), Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Comp Sci & Engn, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA.",sbeamer@ucsc.edu,,,Army Research Laboratory; Army Research Office [W911NF1910466]; U.S. Department of Defense (DOD) [W911NF1910466] Funding Source: U.S. Department of Defense (DOD),Army Research Laboratory(United States Department of DefenseUS Army Research Laboratory (ARL)); Army Research Office; U.S. Department of Defense (DOD)(United States Department of Defense),This work was supported in part by the Army Research Laboratory and in part by the Army Research Office under Contract/Grant W911NF1910466.,,12,8,9,0,2,IEEE COMPUTER SOC,LOS ALAMITOS,"10662 LOS VAQUEROS CIRCLE, PO BOX 3014, LOS ALAMITOS, CA 90720-1314 USA",0272-1732,1937-4143,,IEEE MICRO,IEEE Micro,JUL-AUG,2020,40,4,,,,,112,119,,10.1109/MM.2020.2997639,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/MM.2020.2997639,,,8,"Computer Science, Hardware & Architecture; Computer Science, Software Engineering",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Computer Science,MF6AX,,Green Submitted,,,8/15/24,WOS:000545423800013,,1,38,,0,not sure if this is even about OSH

However, they suffer from some design issues related to the difficulty to implement them on different hardware platforms without additional efforts. To bridge this gap, recently, the IEEE Computational Intelligence Society has sponsored the publication of the standard IEEE Std 1855-2016 which is aimed at providing the fuzzy community with a well-defined approach to model FRBSs in a hardware-independent way. In order to provide a runnable version of an FRBS that is designed in accordance with the IEEE Std 1855-2016, the open source library Java Fuzzy Markup Language (JFML) has been developed. However, due to hardware and/or software limitations of embedded systems, it is not always possible to run an IEEE Std 1855-2016 FRBS on this kind of systems. The aim of this paper is to overcome this drawback by developing a new JFML module that assists developers in the design and implementation of FRBSs for open hardware-embedded systems. In detail, the module supports several connection types (WiFi, Bluetooth, and USB) in order to make feasible running FRBSs in a remote computer when, due to hardware limitations, it is not possible that they run locally in the embedded systems. The new JFML module is ready for ArduinoTM and Raspberry Pi, but it can be easily extended to other hardware architectures. Moreover, the new JFML module allows to automatically generate runnable files on Arduino(TM) or Raspberry Pi in order to support nonexpert users, that is, users without specific knowledge about embedded systems or without strong programming skills.

However, the use of laboratory automation in academic laboratories is limited due to high acquisition costs and the inability to customize off-the-shelf hardware. To address these challenges, we present an Open Source Hardware concept, referred to as OpenWorkstation, to build an assembly line-inspired platform consisting of ready-to-use and customizable modules. In contrast to current standalone solutions, the OpenWorkstation concept enables the combination of single hardware modules - each with a specific set of functionalities - to a modular workstation to provide a fully automated setup. The base setup consists of a pipetting and transport module and is designed to execute basic protocol steps for in vitro research applications, including pipetting operations for liquids and viscous substances and transportation of cell culture vessels between the modules. We demonstrate the successful application of this concept within a case study by the development of a storage module to facilitate high-throughput studies and a photo-crosslinker module to initiate photo-induced polymerization of hydrogel solutions. We present a Systems Engineering framework for customized module development, guidance for the design and assembly of the presented modules, and operational instructions on the usage of the workstation. By combining capabilities from various open source instrumentations into a modular technology platform, the OpenWorkstation concept will facilitate efficient and reliable experimentation for in vitro research. Ultimately, this concept will allow academic groups to improve replicability and reproducibility in cell culture process operations towards more economical and innovative research in the future.
