One of the most fundamental questions relating to these phenomena is why developers contribute their private resources to these public goods. While this question has been discussed, theorized, and empirically investigated in the context of OSS, there has been no research so far in the context of OSH. Can we really assume the motivations behind the development of the OSH to be the same as those behind OSS? Based on the self&#8208;determination theory (SDT), we provide original insights into the motivations behind contributions to OSH development. We collected data from the most common and active 3D printing communities, which are the main loci of OSH development. We thus have a unique cross&#8208;sectional data set with participants from over 30 different countries using all kinds of different OSH platforms. Our analysis reveals several important findings: firstly, the motivations are in some aspects very similar to those in open source software notwithstanding different possibilities, hurdles, and incentives regarding the OSS and OSH. Above all, enjoyment&#8208;based intrinsic motivation is a major factor affecting contribution levels. Secondly, among internalized extrinsic motivations, expected private benefits through improving own skills stands out. Thirdly, different factors of internalized extrinsic motivations can have different moderating effects on the effect of enjoyment&#8208;based intrinsic motivation. Given the imminent changes in business models throughout manufacturing industries in order to adapt to the challenge that OSH will increasingly pose, our findings have important implications not only for OSH communities and 3D development platforms, but also for businesses that want and probably soon have to engage in open innovation.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,720,,,

Although promising, each base station needs accurate estimation of the channel state information (CSI), either through feedback or channel reciprocity schemes in order to achieve the benefits of massive MIMO in practice. Time division duplex (TDD) has been suggested as a better mode to acquire timely CSI in massive MIMO systems. The use of non-orthogonal pilot schemes, proposed for channel estimation in multi-cell TDD networks, is considered as a major source of pilot contamination in the literature due to the limitations of coherence time. Given the importance of pilot contamination in massive MIMO systems, we provide an extensive survey on pilot contamination, and identify other possible sources of pilot contamination, which include hardware impairment and non-reciprocal transceivers. We review established theories that have analyzed the effect of pilot contamination on the performance of massive MIMO systems, particularly on achievable rates. Next, we categorize the different proposed mitigation techniques for pilot contamination using the following taxonomy: pilot-based approach and subspace-based approach. Finally, we highlight the open issues, such as training overhead, deployment scenario, computational complexity, use of channel reciprocity, and conclude with broader perspective and a look at future trends in pilot contamination in massive MIMO systems.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,811,,,

Such firm strategies are now common for open source software and other information goods. However, they pose conceptual and practical uncertainties for hardware-focused companies, particularly as research on open hardware has emphasized community rather than firm success. Here we study firm openness in 3D printing, with a case study of how MakerBot Industries leveraged external communities and selective openness become the consumer market leader. After reviewing the literature on systemic innovation and selective openness, we document the proprietary strategies of a dozen startup companies during the first two decades of the 3D printing industry. We contrast this to the open hardware, software and content strategy that MakerBot's founders used to enter and grow the consumer market from 2009 onward. We show how MakerBot shifted to a selectively open, systemic innovation strategy that complemented proprietary hardware and software with open user-generated content from its Thingiverse online community. From this, we suggest the inherent complementarity of selective openness strategies between open and proprietary components, and conclude with predictions as to when and how a startup or incumbent firm will combine open and proprietary elements.

Hardware released under free licenses is known as free and open source hardware (FOSH). The availability of these FOSH designs has a large value to those with access to digital manufacturing methods and particularly for scientists with needs for highly-customized low-volume production products. It is challenging to use traditional funding models to support the necessary investment of resources in FOSH development because of the difficulty in quantifying the value of the result. In order to overcome that challenge and harvest the current opportunity in both low-cost scientific equipment and consumer products, this article evaluates the following methods to quantify the value of FOSH design including: 1) downloaded substitution valuation; 2) avoided reproduction valuation and 3) market savings valuation along with additional benefits related to market expansion, scientific innovation acceleration, educational enhancement and medical care improvement. The strengths and weaknesses of these methods are analyzed and the results show that the methods are relatively straight-forward to institute, based on reliable freely-available data, and that they minimize assumptions. A case study of a syringe pump with numerous scientific and medical applications is presented. The results found millions of dollars of economic value from a relatively simple scientific device being released under open-licenses representing orders of magnitude increase in value from conventional proprietary development. The inescapable conclusion of this study is that FOSH development should be funded by organizations interested in maximizing return on public investments particularly in technologies associated with science, medicine and education.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,911,,,

This is done through distributed manufacturing, in which products are produced close to end users. There is anecdotal evidence that these opportunities are heavily geographically dependent, with some locations unable to acquire components to build open hardware at accessible prices because of trade restrictions, tariffs, taxes, or market availability. Supply chain disruptions during the COVID-19 pandemic exacerbated this and forced designers to pivot towards a la carte-style design frameworks for critical system components. To further develop this phenomenon, a case study of free and open-source solar photovoltaic (PV) racking systems is provided. Two similar open-source designs made from different materials are compared in terms of capital costs for their detailed bill of materials throughout ten locations in North, Central and South America.

This trend has increased attention to open source hardware (OSH): a phenomenon that extends the intellectual property management and development practices in open source software (OSS) into the design of physical objects. OSH projects are different from OSS projects due to product type, and distinct from traditional closed source new product development (NPD) ones due to their openness. These differences challenge the degree of applicability of existing project success definitions in the OSH context. To investigate project success in OSH, we conducted a qualitative survey with practitioners. We report characteristics of successful OSH projects through three identified themes: (a) value creation - the big-picture impact, (b) quality of output - the quality of the hardware and accompanying documentation and (c) project process - activities that contribute to success. We contextualise by comparing OSH with selected literature on the success of OSS and NPD project management. While our study confirms a similarity between OSS and OSH in defining project success, it also highlights themes that are uniquely important to the latter. These findings are helpful for OSH development practice and could provide lessons for OSS development and closed source NPD.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,1140,,,

However, a common belief is that the greater economic cost and complexity of hybrid digital objects (i.e., digital objects with both hardware and software) precludes their development with open source methods traditionally used for software. We study a sophisticated OSH named White Rabbit initiated at CERN and developed through a vibrant and heterogenous open source community. Our findings show that the assumption that hardware and software require fundamentally distinctive development and production modes should be replaced with a more nuanced differentiation characterized by three main attributes describing an object's composition: embodiment, modularity, and granularity. Taken together, these three attributes determine how a hybrid object is developed throughout its evolution in an open source community. Our research offers several contributions. First, we provide a more nuanced view of the consequences of the material embodiment of hardware. Once considered a simple deterrent to open source development, we describe how economic cost is subordinate to more influential aspects of an object's physical layers: as the open source community modifies the object to accommodate the operating requirements of diverse physical instantiations, such modifications can be incorporated in the logical design covered by the open source license. Additionally, we show how embodiment, modularity, and granularity progress through the object's evolution and how this maturation subsequently affects development modes. We trace the implications of our findings for hybrids and digital object conceptualizations in IS research, open source development and, more broadly, normative implications for OSH in scientific and commercial computing.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,1146,,,

Additionally, people may build, adapt, use and sell physical artefacts based on these designs in accordance with the notion of open source. The (potential) economic impact and value of open source hardware is hard to quantify as contributors usually do not get paid and users do not necessarily buy products from vendors.

Understanding inequality as a representation problem is valuable but does not necessarily unpack its mechanisms. Using an epistemic justice lens, I look at scientific instruments as sites of inequality by design in environmental studies. Even when in recent years we have seen an explosion of new scientific tools in the field, how these tools reproduce inequalities is underexplored. The open science hardware movement provides an opportunity for studying this question in practice. I present findings from qualitative research with two projects of the Gathering for Open Science Hardware (GOSH) community in Latin America during 2018-2022. These findings show how researchers use open science hardware to overcome structural inequalities in environmental research. Beyond their lower cost, researchers are using open hardware to enable new ideas and concepts to emerge through flexible and repairable designs. I describe four mechanisms that enable the creation of new epistemic resources: autonomy, flexibility, impact and resilience, and I identify significant limitations to this potential.

However, three decades ago, the medical community started to consider repurposing ultrasound scanners to improve physical examinations. A broad community of healthcare professionals trained in the new clinical examination paradigm could not be created due to the very high price of portable ultrasound scanners available on the market. In this paper, we study an Open-Source Hardware (OSH) community that aims to improve diagnosis in hospitals and medically underserved areas worldwide. They are designing an echo-stethoscope - a portable ultrasound scanner - that would be affordable in low and middle-income countries. The variety of expertise pooled to achieve this objective puts this knowledge common (KC) at the crossroads of open-source software (OSS), OSH, and medical communities. Unlike typical KC outcomes, an ultrasound probe is a physical object. Development and innovation in the physical world bring social dilemmas that the community has to overcome, restrictions in terms of openness, and in this case, unintended privatization. Our study uses the governing knowledge common framework (GKCF), a modified institutional analysis and development framework, to untangle the interactions between resources, participants, and governance structures. Our research describes why and how the creation of a physical object subject to industry regulation influences the evolution and governance of the KC. We provide evidence that temporary privatization of the KC can be used as a way to protect and sustain a common during the industrialization phase. We also demonstrate how a portfolio of projects is an effective and resilient way to help the common survive this privatization step.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,1934,,,

However, open source (hardware) design implies a tremendous change in both design practices and philosophy because it is partly related to the movements of creative commons and the sharing economy. From this perspective one could think that participation is crucial in the success of open source design projects. In this paper, we analyse 9 case studies in the light of 3 hypotheses. If many studies highlight the potential of the crowd as a resource for design tasks, our study shows that for open source design communities the participation is not massive. In this study, we used an activity-based approach to build our model. As open source design processes are fairly unstructured and based on voluntary participation, it is impossible to adopt a classical task-based model. With the help of this model, we were able evaluate the overall size of the active community, the participation rate with regards to the activities.

Conflating these matters complicates claims about the inherent virtues of participation, especially in technical cultures.

It is supposed to transform Shenzhen into the Silicon Valley of hardware. Two groups, one local, the shanzhai community made up of entrepreneurs and companies historically based on a strategy of imitating high-end products, and the other, a more international maker community, are thought to be the main drivers of this change using values of ‚Äòopen innovation‚Äô. The building of this ecosystem relies largely on practices associated with being open-source. Like in California, open innovation contributed to the creation of resources for the development of a vast high-tech industry. This ethnographic field study shows how, while both communities, the international makers and the shanzhai, draw on open innovation, they do not have the same values. For the shanzhai, open innovation means total deregulation and a kind of coopetition that poorly masks fierce competition.

Most of these training modules simplify the development environment, for example, by using LEGO bricks or playing cards. This oversimplification has been shown to result in limited transferability of learning to industrial practice. Furthermore, there is a lack of teaching modules that specifically address the challenges of applying Agile to physical products. In this paper, we present an open‚Äêsource educational game that realistically simulates a hardware development project to teach Agile principles. Over 2 days, participants design, manufacture, and test modifications for a physical wire bending machine within an authentic engineering and production setting. The training mimics the typical roles, processes, and tools of industrial engineering teams to reflect the challenges of Agile hardware development. The module was evaluated with 44 industry professionals regarding perceived learning and user reaction. A combination of quantitative and qualitative methods was used for the experimental evaluation. The results showed a positive learning effect as the participants' average agreement with Agile principles increased through the training. Concerning user reaction, respondents reported a high degree of relevance, interaction, and confidence, indicating that the realistic simulation of the hardware development appropriately balanced the degree of realism with simplicity. The study showcases the opportunities of properly aligning game components to provoke learning situations targeted by the instructors. It contributes to the extant literature by providing a design framework (product, process, setting, and instruction) and open‚Äêsource access to the tools used for implementation.",https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/cae.22616,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,1170,,,

Whereas these robotic sailboats have good performance with open-source designs, it is actually hard for interested researchers or fans to follow and make their own sailboats with these open-source designs. Thus, in this paper, a generic and flexible unmanned sailboat platform with easy access to the hardware and software architectures is designed and tested. The commonly used 1-m class RC racing sailboat was employed to install Pixhawk V2.4.8, Arduino Mega 2,560, GPS module M8N, custom-designed wind direction sensor, and wireless 433 Mhz telegram. The widely used open-source hardware modules were selected to keep reliable and low-cost hardware setup to emphasize the generality and feasibility of the unmanned sailboat platform. In software architecture, the Pixhawk V2.4.8 provided reliable states' feedback. The Arduino Mega 2,560 received estimated states from Pixhawk V2.4.8 and the wind vane sensor, and then controlled servo actuators of rudder and sail using simplified algorithms. Due to the complexity of introducing robot operating system and its packages, we designed a generic but real-time software architecture just using Arduino Mega 2,560. A suitable line-of-sight guidance strategy and PID-based controllers were used to let the autonomous sailboat sail at user-defined waypoints. Field tests validated the sailing performance in facing WRSC challenges. Results of fleet race, station keeping, and area scanning proved that our design and algorithms could control the 1-m class RC sailboat with acceptable accuracy. The proposed design and algorithms contributed to developing educational, low-cost, micro class autonomous sailboats with accessible, generic, and flexible hardware and software. Besides, our sailboat platform also facilitates readers to develop similar sailboats with more focus on their missions.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,1187,,,

The robot is upgraded by providing it an artificial vision that allows obtaining the position and shape of objects collected by it. A low-cost and open-source hardware solution is also proposed to achieve motion control of the robot through a decentralized control scheme. The robot joints are actuated through five direct current motors coupled to optical encoders. Each encoder signal is fed to a proportional integral derivative controller with anti-windup that employs the motor velocity provided by a state observer. The motion controller works with only two open-architecture Arduino Mega boards, which carry out data acquisition of the optical encoder signals. MATLAB-Simulink is used to implement the controller as well as a friendly graphical interface, which allows the user to interact with the manipulator. The communication between the Arduino boards and MATLAB-Simulink is performed in real-time utilizing the Arduino IO Toolbox. Through the proposed controller, the robot follows a trajectory to collect a desired object, avoiding its collision with other objects.

Advances in three-dimensional (3-D) printing have enabled researchers to quickly customize mechanisms for specific tasks, but the end product is usually not intended for extended use. It would be beneficial to identify strategies to augment the capabilities of additive manufacturing techniques to allow the easy and inexpensive construction of durable and functional hardware. To that end, this article details work on the Yale OpenHand Project, a library of lowcost, 3-D-printed, underactuated hand designs for researchers to freely implement and modify for their own use cases. The designs use cast flexural joints made via the hybrid deposition manufacturing (HDM) process to produce robust, impact-resistant subcomponents and help account for the structural shortcomings of fused deposition manufacturing (FDM).

Unfortunately, as DRAM scales down to smaller technology nodes, it faces key challenges in both data integrity and latency, which strongly affects overall system reliability and performance. To develop reliable and high-performance DRAM-based main memory in future systems, it is critical to characterize, understand, and analyze various aspects (e.g., reliability, latency) of existing DRAM chips. To enable this, there is a strong need for a publicly-available DRAM testing infrastructure that can flexibly and efficiently test DRAM chips in a manner accessible to both software and hardware developers. This paper develops the first such infrastructure, SoftMC (Soft Memory Controller), an FPGA-based testing platform that can control and test memory modules designed for the commonly-used DDR (Double Data Rate) interface. SoftMC has two key properties: (i) it provides flexibility to thoroughly control memory behavior or to implement a wide range of mechanisms using DDR commands, and (ii) it is easy to use as it provides a simple and intuitive high-level programming interface for users, completely hiding the low-level details of the FPGA. We demonstrate the capability, flexibility, and programming ease of SoftMC with two example use cases. First, we implement a test that characterizes the retention time of DRAM cells. Experimental results we obtain using SoftMC are consistent with the findings of prior studies on retention time in modern DRAM, which serves as a validation of our infrastructure. Second, we validate two recently-proposed mechanisms, which rely on accessing recently-refreshed or recently-accessed DRAM cells faster than other DRAM cells. Using our infrastructure, we show that the expected latency reduction effect of these mechanisms is not observable in existing DRAM chips, which demonstrates the usefulness of SoftMC in testing new ideas on existing memory modules. We discuss several other use cases of SoftMC, including the ability to characterize emerging non-volatile memory modules that obey the DDR standard. We hope that our open-source release of SoftMC fills a gap in the space of publicly-available experimental memory testing infrastructures and inspires new studies, ideas, and methodologies in memory system design.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,763,,,

Closed-loop experiments, in which causal interventions are conditioned on the state of the system under investigation, have become increasingly common in neuroscience. Such experiments can have a high degree of explanatory power, but they require a precise implementation that can be difficult to replicate across laboratories. We sought to overcome this limitation by building open-source software that makes it easier to develop and share algorithms for closed-loop control. Approach. We created the Open Ephys GUI, an open-source platform for multichannel electrophysiology experiments. In addition to the standard ‚Äòopen-loop‚Äô visualization and recording functionality, the GUI also includes modules for delivering feedback in response to events detected in the incoming data stream. Importantly, these modules can be built and shared as plugins, which makes it possible for users to extend the functionality of the GUI through a simple API, without having to understand the inner workings of the entire application. Main results. In combination with low-cost, open-source hardware for amplifying and digitizing neural signals, the GUI has been used for closed-loop experiments that perturb the hippocampal theta rhythm in a phase-specific manner. Significance. The Open Ephys GUI is the first widely used application for multichannel electrophysiology that leverages a plugin-based workflow.

Materials and method A field survey is conducted to identify the requirements of users so as to choose specific features and design constraints for the WC. In this multipurpose self-propelled model, a temporarily detachable circular section is fitted in the seat position to access the water closet bowl. This hinged portion can be released by gravity before reaching above the closet basin. After the toilet usage, the circular lid can be brought back to the initial seating using a lever mechanism and a spring-loaded lock restrains its downward movement. Thereafter, it can be used as an ordinary WC for indoor applications. Moreover, a small wheel with 22 in diameter and removable hand-rests ensured the transferability between utilities.

The growth rate of leaves at different growth stages determines the overall LAI, which is used by crop growth models (CGM) for simulating yield. Consequently, precise phenotyping of the leaves can help elucidate phenological processes relating to resource capturing. A stable system for acquiring images and a strong data processing backend play a vital role in reducing throughput time and increasing accuracy of calculations, compared to manual analysis. However, most available solutions are not dynamic, as they use color-based segmentation, which fails to capture leaves with varying shades and shapes. We have developed a system that uses a low-cost setup to acquire images and an automated pipeline to manage the data storage on the device and in the cloud. The system is powered by virtual machines that run multiple custom-trained deep learning models to segment out leaves, calculate leaf area (LA) for the whole set and at the individual leaf level, overlays important information on the images, and appends them on a compatible file used for CGMs with very high accuracy.

In this work, a simple to use, cost-effective instrument for spectral analysis of plants and fruits based on open-source hardware and software has been developed. The instrument is a 7-band spectrophotometer equipped with a microprocessor that allows one to acquire the reflectance spectrum of samples and compute up to 9 vegetation indices. The accuracy in reflectance measurements is between 0.4% and 1.4% full scale, just above that of high-end spectrophotometers, while the precision at determining the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) is 0.61%, between 3 and 6 times better than more expensive commercial instruments. Some use cases of this instrument have been tested, and the prototype has proven to be able to precisely monitor minute spectral changes of different plants and fruits under different conditions, most of them before they were perceptible to the bare eye. This kind of information is essential in the decision-making process regarding harvesting, watering, or pest control, allowing precise control of crops.

In this paper, the implementation of a system-on-chip (SoC) based on a 32-bit RISC-V processor with lightweight cryptographic accelerator cores in FPGA and an open-source integrating framework is presented. The system consists of a 32-bit VexRiscv processor, written in SpinalHDL, and lightweight cryptographic accelerator cores for the PRINCE block cipher, the PRESENT-80 block cipher, the ChaCha stream cipher, and the SHA3-512 hash function, written in Verilog HDL and optimized for low latency with fewer clock cycles. The primary aim of this work was to develop a customized SoC platform with a register-controlled bus suitable for integrating lightweight cryptographic cores to become compact embedded systems that require encryption functionalities. Additionally, custom firmware was developed to verify the functionality of the SoC with all integrated accelerator cores, and to evaluate the speed of cryptographic processing. The proposed system was successfully implemented in a Xilinx Nexys4 DDR FPGA development board. The resources of the system in the FPGA were low with 11,830 LUTs and 9552 FFs.

Currently, many emerging contaminants are difficult to measure with no field deployable sensors currently available. Hence, discrete grab samples are required for subsequent laboratory analysis. To capture the spatiotemporal variability in pollution pulses, autosamplers can be used, but commercial offerings are both expensive and have a large footprint. This can be problematic in urban environments where there is a high density of point source inputs and risk of vandalism or theft. Here, we present a small and robust low-cost autosampler that is ideally suited for deployment in urban environments. The design is based on ""off the shelf"" open-source hardware components and software and requires no prior engineering, electronics, or computer programming experience to build. The autosampler uses a small peristaltic pump to enable collection of 14 small volume samples (50 mL) and is housed in a small footprint camera case. To illustrate the technology, we present two use cases for rapid sampling of stormwater pulses of: 1) an urban river channel and 2) green roof runoff. When compared with a commercial autosampler, our device showed comparable results and enabled us to capture temporal dynamics in key water quality parameters (e.g., dissolved organic matter) following rain events in an urban stream. Water quality differences associated with differing green roof design/maintenance regimes (managed and unmanaged vegetation) were captured using the autosampler, highlighting how unmanaged vegetation has a greater potential for mitigating the rapid runoff and peaked pollutant inputs associated with impervious surfaces. These two case studies show that our portable autosampler provides capacity to improve understanding of the impact of urban design and infrastructure on water quality and can lead to the development of more effective mitigation solutions. Finally, we discuss opportunities for further technical refinement of our autosampler and applications to improve environmental monitoring. We propose a holistic monitoring approach to address some of the outstanding challenges in urban areas and enable monitoring to shift from discrete point sources towards characterization of catchment or network scale dynamics.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,972,,,

However, due to the intensive computations needed by DFI, there are only limited proposals successfully implementing partial DFI with low performance overhead. Moreover, all the previous studies failed to enforce the complete DFI policy in a real hardware platform, while trading off security strength for performance efficiency.

Similarly, we validated the temperature control using thermography, obtaining a range of +/- 0.2 C-degrees . The electromagnets produced a magnetic force of 15 milliTesla, demonstrating precise immobilization of magnetic beads. We show the potential of PhageBox for bacteriophage research through three initial protocols: a universal framework for PCR, T7 bacteriophage restriction enzyme digestion, and concentrating phi X174 RF genomic DNA. Conclusion: Our work presents an open-source hardware and software extension for digital microfluidics devices. This extension integrates temperature and electromagnetic modules, demonstrating efficacy in biomedical applications and potential for bacteriophage research. Significance: We developed PhageBox to be accessible: the components are off-the-shelf at a low cost ( <= $200), and the hardware designs and software code are open-source. With the long aim of ensuring reproducibility and accelerating collaboration, we also provide a DIY-build document.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,1029,,,

However, it disrupts the head direction system because of the lack of vestibular stimulation. To overcome this limitation, we developed a novel rotation platform which can be driven by the experimenter (open-loop) or by animal movement (closed-loop). The platform is modular, affordable, easy to build and open source. Additional modules presented here include cameras for monitoring eye movements, visual virtual reality, and a micro-manipulator for positioning various probes for recording or optical interference. We demonstrate the utility of the platform by recording eye movements and showing the robust activation of head-direction cells. This novel experimental apparatus combines the advantages of head fixation and intact vestibular activity in the horizontal plane. The open-loop mode can be used to study e.g., vestibular sensory representation and processing, while the closed-loop mode allows animals to navigate in rotational space, providing a better substrate for 2-D navigation in virtual environments.

In this work, we developed a ""do it yourself"" multichannel syringe pump by using easily available low-cost components and microcontrollers, which can be used for educational and/or research purposes in the study of microfluidics and flow chemistry. An Arduino UNO board with CNC shield expansion board and A4988 stepper motor driver is used to control the injection volume and rate of the four syringes. The Arduino-based open-source community minimizes the technical knowledge required to build the system and makes it readily shareable. Detailed fabrication guidelines are provided for the device, which is priced well below commercial alternatives and promotes the development of open hardware for microprocess engineering. The operation of the syringe pump can be controlled by the Arduino IDE or other software through the serial port, which is very beneficial for integration with other devices. Moreover, this multichannel syringe pump is also programmable and can be automatically operated. In order to verify the utility of the platform, we have carried out relevant demonstration experiments of microcapsule preparation for functioning cosmetic product and droplet generation based on microfluidic technique.

The complexity involved in researching and building soft robots often stems from the interconnectedness of design and control aspects, which are rarely addressed together as a unified problem. To address such complex interdependencies in soft robotics, the Sorotoki toolkit provides a comprehensive and modular programming environment composed of seven Object-Oriented classes. These classes are designed to work together to solve a wide range of soft robotic problems, offering versatility and flexibility for its users. We provide here a comprehensive overview of the Sorotoki software architecture to highlight its usage and applications. The details and interconnections of each module are thoroughly described, collectively explaining how to gradually introduce modeling complexity for various soft robotic scenarios. The effectiveness of Sorotoki is also demonstrated through a range of case studies, including novel problem scenarios and established works widely recognized in the soft robotics community. These case studies cover a broad range of research problems, including: inverse design of soft actuators, passive and active soft locomotion, object manipulation with soft grippers, meta-materials, model reduction, model-based control of soft robots, and online shape estimation. Additionally, the toolkit provides access to four open-hardware soft robotic systems that can be fabricated using commercially available 3D printers.

The ability to leverage shared hardware and software can streamline the development process, providing greater flexibility to researchers looking to expand the number of traits they can measure, the frequency and duration of sampling, and the number of replicate devices they can afford to deploy.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,1134,,,

This open-hardware system, intended to support a home-made therapy process in people with reduced dorsiflexion ability, contains three main building blocks: an electromechanical platform, an immersive virtual reality interface and the firmware. The electromechanical training platform is the core of the system, which acts as a gateway interface of sensors-actuators for a closed loop system, through an immersive virtual reality application, the patient closes the loop by acting as the controller by means of a ""virtual dummy"" preform-ing in mirror configuration.The platform measures and process the dorsiflexion angle described by both ankles, real -time transmitting the information to the mobile phone virtual application to be presented as a mirror. The onboard microprocessor drives the operation of the electric stimulation interface, which is sent through two channels to both, healthy and affected lower limbs. The platform communicates continuously through a USB bidirectional interface with a per-sonal computer, in which the physician enters the rehabilitation protocol and follows the patient performance.

We try to reduce some of these barriers by presenting a super-resolution upgrade to our recently presented open-source optical toolbox UC2. Our new injection moulded parts allow larger builds with higher precision. The 4x lower manufacturing tolerance compared to three-dimensional printing makes assemblies more reproducible. By adding consumer-grade available open-source hardware such as digital mirror devices and laser projectors, we demonstrate a compact three-dimensional multimodal setup that combines image scanning microscopy and structured illumination microscopy. We demonstrate a gain in resolution and optical sectioning using the two different modes compared to the widefield limit by imaging Alexa Fluor (R) 647- and Silicon Rhodamine-stained HeLa cells. We compare different objective lenses and by sharing the designs and manuals of our setup, we make super-resolution imaging available to everyone.

One of the most promising solutions that couple the flexibility of a processor with the performance and efficiency of an accelerator is the vector processor architecture. Since RISC-V has only recently frozen its vector ISA extension, no open-source RISC-V-based vector processor has been fabricated and characterized. This brief presents the Yun SoC, featuring the first implementation of an open-source RISC-V-based vector processor in TSMC's 65-nm technology. Our efficient 4-lane design achieves almost peak theoretical performance on large matrix multiplication problems with an FPU utilization of almost 90%. Yun, with a critical path of 30 FO4 inverter delays, achieves a peak performance of 2.83 GFLOPSDP (at 400 MHz and 1.5 V), a leading-edge area efficiency of 3 GFLOPSP/cycle/MGE, and a peak energy efficiency of 10.8 GFLOPSDP (at 100 MHz and 0.85 V).

Typically, their far-field characteristics are validated in expensive, dedicated facilities such as open range sites, or anechoic chambers. Despite being necessary for obtaining high-precision data (e.g., for device qualification), the use of costly infrastructure might not be fully justified when the main goal of measurements includes demonstration of the methodology behind determination of the performance figures of interest (e.g., for the purpose of teaching), or rough validation of the EM simulation model correctness. From this perspective, systems for far-field measurements in non-anechoic environments represent an interesting alternative to the utilization of the state-of-the-art equipment and facilities. Despite their proven usefulness, the mentioned systems are normally constructed around the expensive, laboratory-grade equipment, which contradicts the whole concept of low-cost measurements. This paper discusses a cost-efficient, mobile system for experimental validation of antennas. Its main components include the in-house developed rotary heads, an open-hardware-based vector network analyzer, and the measurements post-processing software. The cost of the system amounts to only around 3630 USD. The capabilities of the device have been demonstrated through measurements of two antenna structures. The considered performance figures include radiation pattern and single-direction gain vs. frequency. Comparisons against the measurements performed in benchmark conditions (anechoic chamber), as well as using professional network analyzer have also been provided. Furthermore, the documentation that facilitates the construction of the system components is shared in an online repository.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,1143,,,

The historical and current importance of Aplysia for biomedical research and the mounting climate crisis necessitates protection of Aplysia genetic resources. The goal of this work was to prototype open-hardware sizing, processing, and packaging devices for A. californica early life stages suitable for integration into a cryopreservation pathway. The Strand Centi-Sizer was a low-cost, fused filament fabrication 3-D printable device that increased experiment preparation efficiency and standardized the cutting of egg strands customizable to user needs. A downstream system of 3-D printed devices was also prototyped to address inefficiencies in handling of egg strand sections for processing and packaging into existing cryopreservation straw platforms. Time studies were conducted comparing manual methods (i.e., no specialized equipment) with open hardware to demonstrate utility of the devices and to encourage community members to design and prototype new devices to address recurrent and novel problems in other aquatic animals that produce egg strands.

This approach enables the targeted recording from fluorescent reporter protein expressing neurons or glial cells in brain slices and fluorescence-assisted electrophysiological recordings from subcellular structures. However, the existing tools to mix multiple light sources in one-photon microscopy are limited. Here, we present the development of several microcontroller devices that provide temporal and intensity control of light emitting diodes (LEDs) for computer controlled microscopy illumination. We interfaced one microcontroller with mu Manager for rapid and dynamic overlay of transmitted and fluorescent images. Moreover, on the basis of this illumination system we implemented an electronic circuit to combine two pulsed LED light sources for fast (up to 1 kHz) ratiometric calcium (Ca2+) imaging. This microcontroller enabled the calibration of intracellular Ca2+ concentration and furthermore the combination of Ca2+ imaging with optogenetic activation. The devices are based on affordable components and open-source hardware and software. Integration into existing bright-field microscope systems will take similar to 1 day. The microcontroller based LED imaging substantially advances conventional illumination methods by limiting light exposure and adding versatility and speed.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,1231,,,

Spraying during stable atmospheric conditions should be avoided to prevent surface-temperature inversion-induced off-target drift of crop protection materials. Previous statistical analysis determined times of high likelihood of stable atmospheric conditions, which are unfavorable for spraying, during the day under clear and cloudy conditions in hot summer months in the Mississippi Delta. Results validated the thresholds of temperature increase in the morning and temperature drop in the afternoon with wind speeds and the transition between stable and unstable atmospheric conditions. With this information, an algorithm was developed to calculate if atmospheric conditions were favorable for spraying based on field temperature and wind speed at any instant. With this algorithm, a web application was built to provide real-time determination of atmospheric stability and hourly online recommendation of whether aerial applications were appropriate for a location and time in the Mississippi Delta. This study further developed another web application specifically for Stoneville, Mississippi, with data measured from weather stations constructed from inexpensive open-source electronics, accessories, and software for more accurate online guidance for site-specific drift management. The web application is adapted for accessing on mobile terminals, such as smartphones and tablets, and provides timely guidance for aerial applicators and producers to avoid spray drift and air quality issues long distances downwind in the area.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,1236,,,

One area that requires improved supply chain resilience and that is of particular importance to electronic designers is the shortage of basic dual in-line package (DIP) electronic components commonly used for prototyping. This anecdotal observation was investigated as a case study of using additive manufacturing to enforce contact between premade, off-the-shelf conductors to allow for electrical continuity between two arbitrary points by examining data relating to the stock quantity of electronic components, extracted from Digi-Key Electronics. This study applies this concept using an open hardware approach for the design, testing, and use of a simple, parametric, 3-D printable invention that allows for small outline integrated circuit (SOIC) components to be used in DIP package circuits (i.e., breadboards, protoboards, etc.). The additive manufacture breakout board (AMBB) design was developed using two different open-source modelers, OpenSCAD and FreeCAD, to provide reliable and consistent electrical contact between the component and the rest of the circuit and was demonstrated with reusable 8-SOIC to DIP breakout adapters. The three-part design was optimized for manufacturing with RepRap-class fused filament 3-D printers, making the AMBB a prime candidate for use in distributed manufacturing models. The AMBB offers increased flexibility during circuit prototyping by allowing arbitrary connections between the component and prototyping interface as well as superior organization through the ability to color-code different component types. The cost of the AMBB is CAD $0.066/unit, which is a 94% saving compared to conventional PCB-based breakout boards. Use of the AMBB device can provide electronics designers with an increased selection of components for through-hole use by more than a factor of seven. Future development of AMBB devices to allow for low-cost conversion between arbitrary package types provides a path towards more accessible and inclusive electronics design as well as faster prototyping and technical innovation.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,1355,,,

For example, researcher-developed sensors, such as audio and video loggers, are being increasingly attached to wildlife tracking collars to provide insights into a range of topics from species interactions to physiology. However, such devices are often prohibitively power-intensive, relative to conventional wildlife collar sensors, and their retrieval without compromising long-term data collection and animal welfare remains a challenge. We present an open-source system (SensorDrop) for remotely detaching individual sensors from wildlife collars. SensorDrop facilitates the retrieval of power-intensive sensors while leaving non-resource-intensive sensors intact on animals. SensorDrop systems can be made using commercially available components and are a fraction of the cost of other timed drop-off devices that detach full wildlife tracking collars. From 2021 to 2022, eight SensorDrop units were successfully deployed on free-ranging African wild dog packs in the Okavango Delta as part of audio-accelerometer sensor bundles attached to wildlife collars. All SensorDrop units detached after 2-3 weeks and facilitated the collection of audio and accelerometer data while leaving wildlife GPS collars intact to continue collecting locational data (>1 year), critical for long-term conservation population monitoring in the region. SensorDrop offers a low-cost method to remotely detach and retrieve individual sensors from wildlife collars. By selectively detaching battery-depleted sensors, SensorDrop maximizes the amount of data collected per wildlife collar deployment and mitigates ethical concerns on animal rehandling. SensorDrop adds to the growing body of open-source animal-borne technologies being utilized by wildlife researchers to innovate and expand upon data collection practices and supports the continued ethical use of novel technologies within wildlife studies.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,1380,,,

From a tribological point of view, these are often linked to the reduction of wear and friction. When testing new materials, coating systems or lubricants, the underlying mechanisms and physical relationships are investigated by the deployment of simplified model tests. Advanced commercial test rigs allow high -resolution measurement of important friction and wear parameters, but also entail a considerable cost and thus a certain entry barrier to deal further with tribological aspects. In many research projects, therefore, self -developed test rigs are used, which at the same time, however, makes comparability and reproducibility with other systems considerably more difficult. For this reason, we have developed a pin -on -disc tribometer based on the open hardware approach, which can be completely additively manufactured by fused filament fabrication. In addition to presenting the customizable measurement system, we investigated the measurement capability using 50 repeated measurements on two different tribological test systems. The reproducibility of the measured values was 0.4 % and 1.1 % for friction and 0.6 % and 1.0 % for wear and was thus considerably lower than the standard deviation in the tests on a single tribometer, which was up to 7.7 % and 16.1 % for friction and wear, respectively. So, the presented tribometer can be used, for example, to perform high throughput tests and thus to detect systematic correlations, e.g., in combination with machine learning approaches.

To prevent root illumination during experimental procedures, which would heavily affect root development, DarkRoot (D-Root) devices (DRDs) have been developed.

Proteomic analyses confirmed significant effects of root illumination on barley root and shoot proteomes. Additionally, we confirmed the significant effect of root illumination on barley root and shoot phenotypes. Our data therefore reinforces the importance of the application of field conditions in the lab and the value of our novel device, the DRD-BIBLOX.

Seaweed presents a promising option but requires investigation into the viability of unconventionally sourced ropes for harvesting. In this regard, a low-cost reliable method to test the tensile strength of rope is needed to validate alternative materials for use in harvesting seaweed. Commercial rope testing jigs alone range in price from several thousand to tens of thousands of dollars, so there is interest in developing a lower-cost alternative. Addressing these needs, this article reports on an open-source design for tensile strength rope testing hardware. The hardware design focuses on using readily available parts that can be both sourced from a hardware store and manufactured with simple tools to provide the greatest geographic accessibility. The jig design, which can be fabricated for CAD 20, is two to three orders of magnitude less expensive than commercially available solutions. The jig was built and tested using a case study example investigating denim materials (of 1 5/8‚Äù, 3 1/4‚Äù, 4 7/8‚Äù, 6 1/2‚Äù, and 8 1/8‚Äù widths) as a potential alternative rope material for seaweed farming. Denim demonstrated strengths of up to 1.65 kN for the widest sample, and the jig demonstrated sufficient strength and stiffness for operations at forces below 4 kN. The results are discussed and areas for future improvements are outlined to adapt the device to other circumstances and increase the strength of materials that can be tested.",https://www.mdpi.com/2813-6640/2/1/2/pdf,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,1472,,,

Direct geo-referencing system uses the technology of remote sensing to quickly grasp images, GPS tracks, and camera position. These data allows the construction of large volumes of images with geographic coordinates. So that users can be measured directly on the images. In order to properly calculate positioning, all the sensor signals must be synchronized. Traditional aerial photography use Position and Orientation System (POS) to integrate image, coordinates and camera position. However, it is very expensive. And users could not use the result immediately because the position information does not embed into image. To considerations of economy and efficiency, this study aims to develop a direct geo-referencing system based on open source software and hardware platform. After using Arduino microcontroller board to integrate the signals, we then can calculate positioning with open source software OpenCV. In the end, we use open source panorama browser, panini, and integrate all these to open source GIS software, Quantum GIS.

However, despite GPUs being one of the more popular accelerators across various applications, there is very little open-source GPU infrastructure in the public domain. We argue that one of the reasons for the lack of open-source infrastructure for GPUs is rooted in the complexity of their ISA and software stacks. In this work, we first propose an ISA extension to RISC-V that supports GPGPUs and graphics. The main goal of the ISA extension proposal is to minimize the ISA changes so that the corresponding changes to the open-source ecosystem are also minimal, which makes for a sustainable development ecosystem. To demonstrate the feasibility of the minimally extended RISC-V ISA, we implemented the complete software and hardware stacks of Vortex on FPGA. Vortex is a PCIe-based soft GPU that supports OpenCL and OpenGL. Vortex can be used in a variety of applications, including machine learning, graph analytics, and graphics rendering.

To overcome this limitation with design, this study reports on of a completely 3D-printable planetary roller screw linear actuator. The device is designed as a parametric script-based computer aided design (CAD) package to allow for the easy adaption for a number of applications such as food processing at different scales. The planetary roller screw is fabricated in dishwasher-safe polyethylene terephthalate glycol (PETG) on an open source machine and tested using an open source testing platform to determine if it could maintain a constant load without slipping and the maximum force. Then, this output is compared to a direct screw press using the same materials. The results found that the maximum force is more than doubled for the roller screw actuator using the same materials, making them adequate for some food processing techniques.

In this article, we present OpenPiton, an open source framework for building scalable architecture research prototypes from one core to 500 million cores. OpenPiton is the world's first open source, general-purpose, multithreaded manycore processor, and framework. OpenPiton is highly configurable, providing a rich design space spanning a variety of hardware parameters that researchers can change. OpenPiton designs can be emulated on FPGA5, where they can run full-stack multiuser Debian Linux. OpenPiton is designed to scale to very large core fabrics, enabling researchers to measure operating system, compiler, and software scalability. The mature code-base reflects the complexity of an industrial-grade design and provides the necessary scripts to build new chips, making OpenPiton a natural choice for computer-aided design (CAD) research.

Retrieval of animal-borne devices is often advantageous for several reasons, including data retrieval and animal welfare considerations; however, commercially available drop-off units are often prohibitively expensive and/or unreliable. Here, we present 'OpenDropOff', an open-source, low-cost electronic drop-off unit for remotely detaching animal-borne sensors from individuals. OpenDropOff devices function by using heat, produced by running an electrical current through resistance wire (nichrome), to melt nylon (e.g. fishing) line, detaching sensors from animals at or after a pre-determined time. OpenDropOff can be constructed using commercially available components (costing < USD $15 in total; approximately 10% or less of many commercially available drop-off units) and can be customized to fit project- and species-specific needs. Fourteen OpenDropOff devices have been field deployed on koalas (Phascolarctos cinereus) (n = 11), swamp wallaby (Wallabia bicolor) (n = 1), Australian brush turkey (Alectura lathami) (n = 1) and Australian white ibis (Threskiornis molucca) (n = 1), with the only detachment failure occurring after a device was damaged during the koala's unrelated death. OpenDropOff devices provide a wider range of researchers with a reliable, cost-effective tool for detaching animal-borne sensors. Their use could allow researchers to more efficiently allocate project resources, and their flexibility provides an opportunity to mitigate animal welfare concerns surrounding the use of animal-borne devices.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,2040,,,

The development of commercial devices has thus far focused on the quality of measurements and their robustness in all field cases. However, both their costs and lack of flexibility to adapt to specific applications have limited their prevalence in the environmental sector. This article presents the development of a low-cost, open hardware resistivity meter to provide the scientific community with a robust and flexible tool for small-scale experiments. Called OhmPi, this basic resistivity meter features current injection and measurement functions associated with a multiplexer that allows performing automatic measurements with up to 32 electrodes (at a cost of less than $500). The device was first tested using a soil-analog electrical circuit to verify the reliability and robustness of the measurements. Results show that OhmPi offers a wide range of resistance measurements, from 0.2 to 1000 O, for contact resistances between 100 and 5000 O. Measurements were then carried out on a small field experiment, in demonstrating good stability of the OhmPi measurements, as well as a strong correlation with the output of a commercial reference instrument.

This paper describes the development of a fully open-source, modular, wireless, battery-powered, smartphone-controlled, low-cost potentiostat capable of conducting electrochemical impedance spectroscopy for the electrochemical detection of the S100B protein captured in an ANTI-S100B functionalized thin-film gold interdigitated electrode platform to support traumatic brain injury diagnosis and treatment. EIS results from the developed potentiostat were validated with a commercial benchtop potentiostat by comparing impedance magnitude and phase values along the EIS frequency range. In addition, an experimental design was performed for detecting S100B in spiked human plasma samples with S100B concentrations of clinical utility, and a calibration curve was found for quantifying S100B detection. No statistically significant differences were found between EIS results from the developed potentiostat and the commercial potentiostat. Statistically significant differences in the changes in charge transfer resistance signal between each tested S100B concentration (p < 0.05) were found, with a limit of detection of 35.73 pg/mL. The modularity of the proposed potentiostat allows easier component changes according to the application demands in power, frequency excitation ranges, wireless communication protocol, signal amplification and transduction, precision, and sampling frequency of ADC, among others, when compared to state-of-the-art opensource EIS potentiostats. In addition, the use of minimal, easy acquirable open-source hardware and software, high-level filtering, accurate ADC, Fast Fourier Transform with low spectral leakage, wireless communication, and the simple user interface provides a framework for facilitating EIS analysis and developing new affordable instrumentation for POC biosensors integrated systems.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,2091,,,

The entire system can be built for around 500 euro. Commercially available flow systems can be very expensive with equipment starting at, but often greatly exceeding, 10,000 euro. This high price of entry makes such technology prohibitively expensive for many research groups. Such systems stand to benefit the emerging academic pharmaceutical field by providing the experience and availability of reliable and affordable solutions. To implement accessible flow chemistry at research facilities, the systems must be made affordable.

Having a compact and individually adjustable system is thus beneficial, with 3D printing technology offering the solution.

Real programming language implementations do not produce out-of-thin-air results. Architectural specifications successfully disallow them. Nonetheless, the difficulty of disallowing them in language specifications causes real, and serious, problems. In the absence of such a specification, essentially all precise reasoning about non-trivial programs becomes impractical. This remains a critical open problem in the specifications of Java, C, and C++, among others. We argue that there are plausible and relatively straight-forward solutions, but their performance impact requires further study. In the long run, they are likely to require strengthening of some hardware guarantees, so that they translate properly to guarantees at the programming language source level.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,928,,,

Within these communities for peer production, citizens can apply cutting-edge technologies in DIY projects. In recent decades, mushrooming makerspaces and hacklabs were embraced by the tech industry and governments alike. Feminist makerspaces and hacklabs, however, as they are centred around a queer feminist agenda, have raised eyebrows. In order to foster diversity in tech development, they create safer spaces for self-expression. Here, feminist lay(wo)men* (To emphasise that the category 'Woman' is constructed and that more people than only those who identify as women are being included, one uses the sign * after the term 'women' ), makers, designers, artists and tinkerers experiment with open-source hardware and software. Art and design projects emerging from feminist hacklabs focus on issues of representation and democratic participation in digital media, as well as on ways of reclaiming one's own body. This article tries to unpack how, after an exhibition on sexual health norms, a feminist hacklab was attacked by local right-wing and conservative politicians. The attack resulted in the defunding of the feminist hacklab. But it also started a transformation process within the collective, as members became aware of critical interferences of diffracting marginalisations. The crisis triggered a discussion on how each member was threatened to very different degrees; for example, there was more at stake for members depending on their legal status in the country. The right-wing and conservative campaign against the feminist hacklab damaged the initiative, but at the same time it pushed the collective to generate increased vehemence and resilience.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,960,,,

De um lado, h√° o surgimento de pol√≠ticas e interesses governamentais nos EUA, China, Cingapura, Taiwam e Europa, sobre o tal ‚Äúmovimento maker‚Äù, levando diretamente ao atual chamado nacionalista do tipo ‚ÄúFa√ßa (o pa√≠s XYZ) Grande Novamente‚Äù. De outro lado, os projetos e atividades maker (experimenta√ß√µes com Arduino, constru√ß√£o de impressoras 3D, montagem de infraestruturas de laborat√≥rios de biologia fa√ßa-vo√ß√™-mesmo), continuam restritos a um nicho explorat√≥rio e privado, mesmo quando s√£o parte de redes informais e transnacionais (Vertesi et al. 2011; Kaiying & Lindtner 2016) que eu denomino ‚Äúdiplomacia geek‚Äù (Kera 2015). Sem afirmar claramente qualquer agenda local ou transnacional, os makers fa√ßa-voc√™-mesmo negociam de maneira produtiva e criativa v√°rias dicotomias entre o individualismo e o coletivismo, entre os interesses locais e globais, nacionalismo e cosmopolitismo. Eles conectam politica e design atrav√©s da liminaridade, em experiencias individuais e explorat√≥rias de prototipagem e tinkering, que diferem muito das formas de aquisi√ß√£o de conhecimentos, habilidades e prototipagem t√≠picas dos contextos industriais e acad√™micos. Para explicar a liminaridade na cultura maker, eu expando o trabalho pioneiro de Gabriela Coleman sobre os paradoxos do movimento hacker (e do movimento de software aberto). As redes descentralizadas e transnacionais de makers e hackers s√£o exemplos (tecnol√≥gicos) de comunidades e liminaridades (Turner, 1969), que negociam v√°rios objetivos e agendas conflitantes por tr√°s da fabrica√ß√£o, tecnologia e globaliza√ß√£o. A cultura maker pode servir a agendas isolacionistas ou cosmopolitas ao mesmo tempo, e ainda abra√ßar a ret√≥rica do c√≥digo aberto enquanto segue parcialmente patenteada, pirateada e h√≠brida. Ela mobiliza as esperan√ßas do Sul Global de tecnologias de baixo custo, enquanto performatiza clich√©s do Vale do Sil√≠cio e se utiliza do trabalho escravo e migrante na China, ou ainda de algum conflito africano sobre recursos minerais. Ao inv√©s de empoderar alguma no√ß√£o idealizada de sujeito, comunidade ou mesmo na√ß√£o, ela demarca os limites e as condi√ß√µes do nosso entendimento sobre governan√ßa e sua rela√ß√£o com a produ√ß√£o, a fabrica√ß√£o e o design.Palavras-chave: Cultura Maker; Hardware de Fonte Aberta; Pol√≠tica e Design; Sul Global.ABSTRACT¬†Maker culture defined as a set of Open Source Hardware (OSHW) tools (Weiss 2008; Mellis & Buechley 2011; Ames et al. 2014), DIY practices (Ratto & Boler 2014; Ames et al. 2014; Lindtner et al. 2016) and promises of digital, automated and distributed fabrication (Gershenfeld et al. 2004; Ratto & Ree 2012) or democratized science equipment (Pearce 2014; Pearce 2012) remains an ambiguous object of our recent political and design fantasies.¬† On one side, there is a surge of government and policy interests in the so called ""maker movements"" in the U.S., China, Singapore, Taiwan, and EU leading directly to the present nationalist calls for ""Making (XYZ nation) great again"". On the other, maker projects and activities (Arduino tinkering, building 3D printers,¬† setting up a DIYbio lab infrastructure)¬† remain niche, exploratory and private, even when they are part of the informal, transnational networks (Vertesi et al. 2011; Kaiying & Lindtner 2016), which I call ""geek diplomacy"" (Kera 2015).¬† Without clearly stating any local or transnational agenda, the DIY makers productively and creatively negotiate the various dichotomies between individualism and collectivism, local and global interests, nationalism and cosmopolitanism. They connect politics and design through ""liminal,"" meaning individual and exploratory, experiences of prototyping and tinkering which differ greatly from the knowledge and skills acquisitions or prototyping common in the industrial or academic context. To explain this liminality in the maker culture, I extended Gabriella Coleman's (2012) pioneering work on the paradoxes of hacker (and open source software) movement. The decentralized and transnational networks of makers and hackers are examples of (technological) communitas and liminality (Turner 1969), which negotiate various conflicting goals and agenda behind making, technology and globalization.¬† The maker culture can serve isolationist and cosmopolitan agendas at the same time, even embrace the open source rhetoric while remaining partially patented, pirated and hybrid. It mobilizes the Global South hopes of low cost technologies while performing the Silicon Valley clich√©s and using migrant slave labor in China, but also African conflict minerals. Rather than empowering some idealized notion of the subject, community or even nation, it demarcates the limits and conditions of our understanding of governance and its relation to production, making, and design.Keywords: Maker Culture; Open Source Hardware; Politics and Design; Global South.",http://revista.ibict.br/liinc/article/viewFile/3875/3202,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,1123,,,

As nations increasingly rely on knowledge assets to grow, the adoption of OSS will have profound economic consequences. This paper identifies the mechanisms inherent to OSS production that help fuel innovation in knowledge-based economies. As a collaborative and open production model, OSS is conceptualized as a prototype of open innovation. Drawing on US employment projections for 2008-2018, the authors' analysis predicts OSS will have a positive impact on employment growth in well-paid salary jobs across multiple sectors of the US economy. OSS-related software development jobs are widely diffuse throughout the economy, help build a skilled labour force and offer wages significantly above the national average. OSS is thus believed to be a strong contributor to growth in high-value employment in the US. The authors also posit that, as industries are exposed to the benefits of OSS as a result of the broad diffusion of OSS-related jobs, open innovation processes outside software development may be adopted through a process of learning and imitation.",https://www.igi-global.com/viewtitle.aspx?TitleId=120934,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,1267,,,

In several countries, governments have begun to recognize the importance of OSS and have started to adopt explicit policies on OSS (Cook & Horobin, 2006). Open Source Software holds several compelling benefits for businesses. Information on wide-ranging use and examples of OSS in organizations are scattered and sometimes skewed to a few OSS.

This study analyzes the economic impacts of a theoretical international agreement that eliminates patent rights for any nuclear aggressor (i.e., free global compulsory licensing of all intellectual property (IP) for a nuclear aggressor). The results found that all but one of the nuclear states would have a significant economic disincentive to start a nuclear attack if the proposal was put into force. Payback times ranged from 1.2 to 40 years, where the entire GDP of a nuclear aggressor would be needed to offset the loss for aggression, indicate such a mechanism as a whole would be an effective nuclear deterrent. This method would not be universally effective without ensuring all nuclear states are members of the international economy and IP processes. With the growth of open-source products and reduced value of patents, this mechanism does have a limited effectiveness time. Currently it appears to be a policy trajectory worthy of future work that can enhance safety from nuclear threat without causing harm to countries of goodwill.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,1351,,,

To achieve its full potential both requires a level playing field and a sufficiently large user base. Governments have a clear role to play in the creation of a level playing field. The public sector meanwhile can choose to be pro-active in its support for open source software, or merely to be neutral so that there are, at least, no barriers to the procurement of open source, or, to demonstrate a bias towards particular proprietary solutions.

As redes descentralizadas e transnacionais de makers e hackers s√£o exemplos (tecnol√≥gicos) de comunidades e liminaridades (Turner, 1969), que negociam v√°rios objetivos e agendas conflitantes por tr√°s da fabrica√ß√£o, tecnologia e globaliza√ß√£o. A cultura maker pode servir a agendas isolacionistas ou cosmopolitas ao mesmo tempo, e ainda abra√ßar a ret√≥rica do c√≥digo aberto enquanto segue parcialmente patenteada, pirateada e h√≠brida. Ela mobiliza as esperan√ßas do Sul Global de tecnologias de baixo custo, enquanto performatiza clich√©s do Vale do Sil√≠cio e se utiliza do trabalho escravo e migrante na China, ou ainda de algum conflito africano sobre recursos minerais. Ao inv√©s de empoderar alguma no√ß√£o idealizada de sujeito, comunidade ou mesmo na√ß√£o, ela demarca os limites e as condi√ß√µes do nosso entendimento sobre governan√ßa e sua rela√ß√£o com a produ√ß√£o, a fabrica√ß√£o e o design.¬†Palavras-chave: Cultura Maker; Hardware de Fonte Aberta; Pol√≠tica e Design; Sul GlobalLink:¬†http://revista.ibict.br/liinc/article/view/3875/3202",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,1557,,,

FOSS is unique in that it is at the same time state of the art technology, a commodity, and a public good. FOSS communities are social groups of individual and organisational contributors that participate voluntarily in the production of public information goods. Furthermore, communities are able to resolve issues without the coordination provided by a central authority like the state. This shapes how FOSS collaboration relates to market competition and the value propositions of businesses. Today collaboration spans both unpaid or volunteer participation and industry contributions that are made in the course of employment or under the guidance of a commercial sponsor. This chapter develops a basic taxonomy based on a combination of the revenue model, the type of good, and the differentiating aspects of FOSS-based products.",https://academic.oup.com/book/chapter-pdf/54406746/oso-9780198862345-chapter-15.pdf,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,1558,,,

Hardware security tokens effectively prevent most password-related security issues and improve security indisputably. However, we would like to highlight that there are new threats from attackers with physical access which need to be discussed. Supply chain adversaries may manipulate devices on a large scale and install backdoors before they even reach end users. In evil maid scenarios, specific devices may even be attacked while already in use. Hence, we thoroughly investigate the security and trustworthiness of seven commercially available open source security tokens, including devices from the two market leaders: SoloKeys and Nitrokey. Unfortunately, we identify and practically verify significant vulnerabilities in all seven examined tokens. Some of them are based on severe, previously undiscovered, vulnerabilities of two major microcontrollers which are used at a large scale in various products. Our findings clearly emphasize the significant threat from supply chain and evil maid scenarios since the attacks are practical and only require moderate attacker efforts. Fortunately, we are able to describe software-based countermeasures as effective improvements to retrofit the examined devices. To improve the security and trustworthiness of future security tokens, we also derive important general design recommendations.",https://tches.iacr.org/index.php/TCHES/article/download/8972/8550,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,2019,,,

Simulation speed becomes even more crucial for agile and open-source hardware design methodologies, because the designers not only want to iterate on designs quicker, but they may also have less resources with which to simulate them. In this article, we execute multiple simulators and analyze them with hardware performance counters. We find some open-source simulators not only outperform a leading commercial simulator, they also achieve comparable or higher instruction throughput on the host processor. Although advanced optimizations may increase the complexity of the simulator, they do not significantly hinder instruction throughput.

The review was conducted by classifying previous studies into three types of Arduino applications: field monitoring systems, wearable systems, and autonomous systems. With regard to field monitoring systems, most studies in mines were classified as atmospheric or geotechnical monitoring. In wearable systems, the health status of the miner was an important consideration, in addition to the environmental conditions of the mine. Arduino can be a useful tool as an initial prototype for autonomous mine systems. Arduino has advantages in that it can be combined with various electronic products and is cost-effective. Therefore, although many studies have been conducted in the laboratory (as opposed to field tests), Arduino applications can be further expanded in the mining field in the future.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,664,,,

State-of-the-Art Computer Architecture research at Indian Academic Institutions is majorly restricted due to unavailability of processor design models that are close to current commercially available cores. The SHAKTI processor initiative aims at breaking this barrier between Academia and Industry by providing open-source Processor and SoC designs. With the advent of RISC-V ISA by UC Berkeley, we have a simple, clean and most importantly an open source ISA that can be used to design processors which have the potential to match the current day processors in the market. The initiative is also driven to provide substantial information about design decisions and promote more competitive learning environment in academia. The processors from SHAKTI will help in aiding research related to architecture, where one can run simulations on the actual hardware and obtain much accurate results, rather than settling with a lesser accurate software simulation. Since these processors and designs are targeted for real-world use, they can also be freely adopted by industries, thereby supporting the initiative further in terms of product-driven research.In this workshop we plan to talk about the various designs that we are working on and how they can be used. The proposed tutorial consists of four parts. The first part emphasizes on the need for open-source hardware design and the rationale behind our choices of ISA and HDL. The second part covers about our microcontroller class (C-class) core and the verification and debug environment. The third part presents our flagship processor which is the industrial class (I-class) core; the various design decisions involved and some performance metrics. The final part concludes on the note of future work and upcoming releases under SHAKTI.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,697,,,

Fortunately, with the recent development and widespread deployment of small-scale manufacturing technologies like RepRap-class 3-D printers and open source microcontrollers, mass distributed manufacturing of ventilators has the potential to overcome medical supply shortages. In this study, after providing a background on ventilators, the academic literature is reviewed to find the existing and already openly-published, vetted designs for ventilators systems. These articles are analyzed to determine if the designs are open source both in spirit (license) as well as practical details (e.g. possessing accessible design source files, bill of materials, assembly instructions, wiring diagrams, firmware and software as well as operation and calibration instructions). Next, the existing Internet and gray literature are reviewed for open source ventilator projects and designs. The results of this review found that the tested and peer-reviewed systems lacked complete documentation and the open systems that were documented were either at the very early stages of design (sometimes without even a prototype) and were essentially only basically tested (if at all). With the considerably larger motivation of an ongoing pandemic, it is assumed these projects will garner greater attention and resources to make significant progress to reach a functional and easily-replicated system. There is a large amount of future work needed to move open source ventilators up to the level considered scientific-grade equipment, and even further work needed to reach medical-grade hardware. Future work is needed to achieve the potential of this approach by developing policies, updating regulations, and securing funding mechanisms for the development and testing of open source ventilators for both the current COVID19 pandemic as well as for future pandemics and for everyday use in low-resource settings.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,730,,,

We review a wide range of open source software for quantum computing, covering all stages of the quantum toolchain from quantum hardware interfaces through quantum compilers to implementations of quantum algorithms, as well as all quantum computing paradigms, including quantum annealing, and discrete and continuous-variable gate-model quantum computing. The evaluation of each project covers characteristics such as documentation, licence, the choice of programming language, compliance with norms of software engineering, and the culture of the project. We find that while the diversity of projects is mesmerizing, only a few attract external developers and even many commercially backed frameworks have shortcomings in software engineering. Based on these observations, we highlight the best practices that could foster a more active community around quantum computing software that welcomes newcomers to the field, but also ensures high-quality, well-documented code.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,756,,,

Hence cheap off-the-shelf Wi-Fi dongles can be used carry out advanced attacks. We demonstrate this by implementing five low-layer attacks using open source Atheros firmware. The first attack consists of unfair channel usage, giving the user a higher throughput while reducing that of others. The second attack defeats countermeasures designed to prevent unfair channel usage. The third attack performs continuous jamming, making the channel unusable for other devices. For the fourth attack we implemented a selective jammer, allowing one to jam specific frames already in the air. The fifth is a novel channel-based Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attack, enabling reliable manipulation of encrypted traffic. These low-layer attacks facilitate novel attacks against higher-layer protocols. To demonstrate this we show how our MitM attack facilitates attacks against the Temporal Key Integrity Protocol (TKIP) when used as a group cipher. Since a substantial number of networks still use TKIP as their group cipher, this shows that weaknesses in TKIP have a higher impact than previously thought.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,777,,,

This trend introduces a need for new formal design procedures that designers can follow when targeting this scientific audience. This study provides five steps in the procedure, encompassing six design principles for the development of free and open-source hardware for scientific applications. A case study is provided for an open-source slide dryer that can be easily fabricated for under $20, which is more than 300 times less than some commercial alternatives. The bespoke design is parametric and easily adjusted for many applications.

For the Internet of Things to continue growing, we need more plentiful resources for building intelligent devices and sensor networks.

There are, however, an increasing number of open embedded platforms available and also a wide selection of off-the-shelf components that can quickly and easily be built into device and network gateway solutions. The question is whether these solutions measure up to built-for-purpose devices. In the paper, we provide a comparison of existing built-for-purpose devices against open source devices. For comparison, we have also designed and rapidly prototyped a sensor node based on off-the-shelf components. We show that these devices compare favorably to built-for-purpose devices in terms of performance, power and cost.

A threat plaguing these systems consists of software vulnerabilities that cause memory corruption, potentially allowing an attacker to breach the device. Software-based countermeasures exist, but suffer from high overhead. In this survey, we investigate whether this could be mitigated using dedicated hardware. Driven by the advancements of open hardware, we focus on implementations for RISC-V, a novel and open architecture tailored for customization. We distinguish between methods validating memory accesses beforehand, obfuscating information necessary for an attack, and detecting memory values corrupted earlier. We compare on qualitative metrics, such as the security coverage and level of transparency, and performance in both software and hardware. Although current implementations do not easily allow for a fair comparison as their evaluation methodologies vary widely, we show that current implementations are suitable to minimize the runtime overhead with a relatively small area overhead. Nevertheless, we identified that further research is still required to mitigate more fine-grained attacks such as intra-object overflows, to integrate into more sophisticated protected execution environments towards resilient systems that are automatically recoverable, and to move towards more harmonized evaluation.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,1028,,,

Medical devices play an important role in managing acute and chronic respiratory failure, including diagnosis, monitoring, and providing artificial ventilation. Current commercially available respiratory devices are very effective but, given their cost, are unaffordable for most patients in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). Herein, we focus on a relatively new design option‚Äîthe open-source hardware approach‚Äîthat, if implemented, will contribute to providing low-cost respiratory medical devices for many patients in LMICs, particularly those without full medical insurance coverage. Open source reflects a set of approaches to conceive and distribute the comprehensive technical information required for building devices. The open-source approach enables free and unrestricted use of the know-how to replicate and manufacture the device or modify its design for improvements or adaptation to different clinical settings or personalized treatments. We describe recent examples of open-source devices for diagnosis/monitoring (measuring inspiratory/expiratory pressures or flow and volume in mechanical ventilators) and for therapy (non-invasive ventilators for adults and continuous positive airway pressure support for infants) that enable building simple, low-cost (hence, affordable), and high-performance solutions for patients in LMICs. Finally, we argue that the common practice of approving clinical trials by the local hospital ethics board can be expanded to ensure patient safety by reviewing, inspecting, and approving open hardware for medical application to maximize the innovation and deployment rate of medical technologies.",https://www.mdpi.com/2075-4426/12/9/1498/pdf,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,2146,,,

The efficient use of irrigation water is a key factor in coping with the food demands of an increasing world population and with the negative effects of climate change on water resource availability in many areas. In this complex context, it is important that farmers can rely on instruments and practices that enable a better management of water at the field scale, whatever the irrigation method they adopt. In this paper, we present an open-hardware device based on the Arduino technology that was developed to allow the continuous monitoring of soil water potential in the root zone for supporting irrigation scheduling at the field scale. The structure of the device is flexible and can be adapted to host different types of sensors. The results, obtained managing irrigation in a peach orchard, show that adoption of the device, together with a simple irrigation scheduling criterion, allowed a significant increase of water use efficiency without causing a reduction of the quantity and quality of crop production.

However, coding education in Thailand appears to lag behind that of many other countries due to the lack of accessible coding learning resources suitable for students as well as the limited number of teachers with coding experience. Regarding these issues, we have developed an open-source hardware-based coding platform named KidBright, based on these requirements: 1. making coding simple for novice learners through the use of graphical blocks with Thai and English support; 2. inspiring young students to develop creative embedded applications with minimal effort; and 3. providing sustainable support for coding education. KidBright is proposed as a coding learning tool that can motivate children to learn to code and develop embedded system projects using its block-based coding environment, the KidBright IDE, in conjunction with its embedded device, the KidBright board. KidBright is distinguished from other embedded programming platforms due to the deployment of a dedicated software framework as the backend of the KidBright IDE. In this article, we introduce KidBright and present the design, architecture, and demonstrations of the software framework, the key roles of which are to conceal low-level hardware issues from learners and to enable makers to develop new command blocks and hardware peripherals in support of KidBright. We claim that, with this particular design, KidBright can help support coding education sustainably. In particular, we present how a small research team introduces coding to a large number of learners who have little or no coding experience, resulting in an impact on coding education in the country.","[Tan-a-ram, Surapol; Leelayuttho, Anuchit; Kittipiyakul, Somphong; Pornsukjantra, Wuthipong; Sereevoravitgul, Thundluck; Intarapanich, Apichart; Kaewkamnerd, Saowaluck; Treeumnuk, Dusadee] Natl Sci & Technol Dev Agcy NSTDA, Natl Elect & Comp Technol Ctr NECTEC, Pathum Thani 12120, Thailand",National Science & Technology Development Agency - Thailand; National Electronics & Computer Technology Center (NECTEC),"Treeumnuk, D (corresponding author), Natl Sci & Technol Dev Agcy NSTDA, Natl Elect & Comp Technol Ctr NECTEC, Pathum Thani 12120, Thailand.",dusadee.treeumnuk@nectec.or.th,"Tan-a-ram, Surapol/GYU-7316-2022","Tan-a-ram, Surapol/0000-0003-3162-1590; Treeumnuk, Dusadee/0000-0002-9743-2787","National Electronics and Computer Technology Center (NECTEC); National Science and Technology Development Agency (NSTDA) [P2052225, P2150643]",National Electronics and Computer Technology Center (NECTEC); National Science and Technology Development Agency (NSTDA),"This work was supported in part by the National Electronics and Computer Technology Center (NECTEC), and in part by the National Science and Technology Development Agency (NSTDA) through projects P2052225 and P2150643.",,46,0,0,2,8,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2071-1050,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,NOV,2022,14,21,,,,,,,14528,10.3390/su142114528,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su142114528,,,31,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,6E8RI,,gold,,,8/15/24,WOS:000883640600001,,0,42,,,

Unfortunately, these algorithms are proprietary, and academia has no means of directly contributing to these results. In fact, nothing at the same stage of development exists in academia. Despite the extensive research in ECG signal processing, from signal conditioning to expert systems, a cohesive single application for clinical use is not ready yet. This is due to a serious lack of coordination in the academic efforts, which involve not only algorithms for signal processing, but also the signal acquisition equipment itself. For instance, the different sampling rates and the different noise levels frequently found in the available signal databases can cause severe incompatibility problems when the integration of different algorithms is desired. Therefore, this work aims to solve this incompatibility problem by providing the academic community with a diagnostic-grade electrocardiograph. The intention is to create a new standardized ECG signals database in order to address the automatic interpretation problem and create an electrocardiography system that can fully assist clinical practitioners, as the proprietary systems do. Achieving this objective is expected through an open and coordinated collaboration platform for which a webpage has already been created.","[Gordillo-Roblero, Luis Alberto; Soto-Cajiga, Jorge Alberto; Diaz-Alonso, Daniela; Perez-Reynoso, Francisco David] Natl Lab Res Med Technol LANITEM, Ctr Engn & Ind Dev CIDESI, Pie de la Cuesta 702, Queretaro 76125, Mexico; [Jimenez-Hernandez, Hugo] Autonomous Univ Queretaro UAQ, Fac Informat, Cerro Campanas S-N, Queretaro 76010, Mexico",CIDESI - Centro de Ingenieria y Desarrollo Industrial,"Gordillo-Roblero, LA (corresponding author), Natl Lab Res Med Technol LANITEM, Ctr Engn & Ind Dev CIDESI, Pie de la Cuesta 702, Queretaro 76125, Mexico.",investigador1.lanitem@cidesi.edu.mx; jsoto@cidesi.edu.mx; daniela.diaz@cidesi.edu.mx; investigador3.lanitem@cidesi.edu.mx; hugo.jimenez@uaq.mx,"Jim√©nez-Hern√°ndez, Hugo/E-8276-2013; Diaz-Alonso, Daniela/L-2938-2017","Jim√©nez-Hern√°ndez, Hugo/0000-0003-0827-6645; Perez Reynoso, Francisco David/0000-0002-6967-9993; Diaz-Alonso, Daniela/0000-0001-9923-0604","National Council of Humanities, Science, and Technology (CONAHCyT); National Council of Humanities, Science and Technology (CONAHCyT)","National Council of Humanities, Science, and Technology (CONAHCyT); National Council of Humanities, Science and Technology (CONAHCyT)","To the National Council of Humanities, Science and Technology (CONAHCyT) for its post-graduate scholarship program.

The method presented here can reduce the capital requirement for system control by one to two orders of magnitude while enhancing flexibility for system expansion and process sharing.","[Slade, Adam; Jassby, David] Univ Calif Riverside, Dept Chem & Environm Engn, Riverside, CA 92521 USA",University of California System; University of California Riverside,"Jassby, D (corresponding author), Univ Calif Riverside, Dept Chem & Environm Engn, Riverside, CA 92521 USA.",djassby@engr.ucr.edu,,,,,,,19,8,11,0,13,ROYAL SOC CHEMISTRY,CAMBRIDGE,"THOMAS GRAHAM HOUSE, SCIENCE PARK, MILTON RD, CAMBRIDGE CB4 0WF, CAMBS, ENGLAND",2053-1400,2053-1419,,ENVIRON SCI-WAT RES,Environ.

Different implementations are commercially available from the industry and yet there is quite an interest from the scientific community to spread its use to the majority of society by means of cost effectiveness and ease of use for solutions. These devices make the most sense when combined with unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), going a step further and alleviating repetitive routines which could be strenuous if traditional methods were adopted. In this work, a low cost and modular solution for a multispectral camera is presented, based on the use of a single panchromatic complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) sensor combined with a rotating wheel of interchangeable band pass optic filters. The system is compatible with open source hardware permitting one to capture, process, store and/or transmit data if needed. In addition, a calibration and characterization methodology has been developed for the camera, allowing not only for quantifying its performance, but also able to characterize other CMOS sensors in the market in order to select the one that best suits the budget and application. The process was experimentally validated by mounting the camera in a Dji Matrice 600 UAV to uncover vegetation indices in a reduced area of palm trees plantation. Results are presented for the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) showing a generated colored map with the captured information.","[Morales, Alejandro; Guerra, Raul; Horstrand, Pablo; Diaz, Maria; Jimenez, Adan; Melian, Jose; Lopez, Sebastian; Lopez, Jose F.] Univ Las Palmas Gran Canaria, Inst Appl Microelect IUMA, Las Palmas Gran Canaria 35003, Spain",Universidad de Las Palmas de Gran Canaria,"Lopez, S (corresponding author), Univ Las Palmas Gran Canaria, Inst Appl Microelect IUMA, Las Palmas Gran Canaria 35003, Spain.",amorales@iuma.ulpgc.es; rguerra@iuma.ulpgc.es; phorstrand@iuma.ulpgc.es; mdmartin@iuma.ulpgc.es; ajimenez@iuma.ulpgc.es; jmelian@iuma.ulpgc.es; lopez@iuma.ulpgc.es; seblopez@iuma.ulpgc.es,"Lopez, Sebastian/HSH-0742-2023; D√≠az, Mar√≠a/S-1204-2019; Lopez, Sebastian/L-8108-2014; Guerra, Raul/L-5233-2018","D√≠az, Mar√≠a/0000-0003-2670-8149; Lopez, Sebastian/0000-0002-2360-6721; Guerra, Raul/0000-0002-4303-3051; Horstrand, Pablo/0000-0002-5488-1654",European Commission; European Regional Development Fund (FEDER) [MAC/1.1.b/226]; Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness (MINECO) of the Spanish Government (PLATINO project) [TEC2017-86722-C4-1 R],European Commission(European Union (EU)European Commission Joint Research Centre); European Regional Development Fund (FEDER)(European Union (EU)); Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness (MINECO) of the Spanish Government (PLATINO project),"This research, including the emphasis on precision agriculture, has been partly funded by the European Commission and the European Regional Development Fund (FEDER) under project APOGEO (Precision Agriculture for the improvement of viticulture in Macaronesia, grant number MAC/1.1.b/226), Interreg Program (MAC 2014-2020).

Despite the recent advent of open-source hardware, the available open-source caches have low configurability, limited lack of support for single-cycle pipelined memory accesses, and use non-standard hardware interfaces. In this paper, the IObundle cache (IOb-Cache), a high-performance configurable open-source cache is proposed, developed and deployed. The cache has front-end and back-end modules for fast integration with processors and memory controllers. The front-end module supports the native interface, and the back-end module supports the native interface and the standard Advanced eXtensible Interface (AXI). The cache is highly configurable in structure and access policies. The back-end can be configured to read bursts of multiple words per transfer to take advantage of the available memory bandwidth. To the best of our knowledge, IOb-Cache is currently the only configurable cache that supports pipelined Central Processing Unit (CPU) interfaces and AXI memory bus interface. Additionally, it has a write-through buffer and an independent controller for fast, most of the time 1-cycle writing together with 1-cycle reading, while previous works only support 1-cycle reading. This allows the best clocks-per-Instruction (CPI) to be close to one (1.055). IOb-Cache is integrated into IOb System-on-Chip (IOb-SoC) Github repository, which has 29 stars and is already being used in 50 projects (forks).","[Roque, Joao, V] IObundle Lda, P-1000158 Lisbon, Portugal; [Lopes, Joao D.; Vestias, Mario P.; de Sousa, Jose T.] INESC ID, P-1000029 Lisbon, Portugal; [Vestias, Mario P.] Inst Super Engn Lisboa, P-1959007 Lisbon, Portugal; [Vestias, Mario P.] Inst Politecn Lisboa, P-1549003 Lisbon, Portugal; [de Sousa, Jose T.] Univ Lisbon, Inst Super Tecn, P-1649004 Lisbon, Portugal",INESC-ID; Universidade de Lisboa; Polytechnic Institute of Lisbon; Polytechnic Institute of Lisbon; Universidade de Lisboa,"de Sousa, JT (corresponding author), INESC ID, P-1000029 Lisbon, Portugal.; de Sousa, JT (corresponding author), Univ Lisbon, Inst Super Tecn, P-1649004 Lisbon, Portugal.",joao.v.roque@tecnico.ulisboa.pt; joao.d.lopes@tecnico.ulisboa.pt; mario.vestias@isel.pt; jose.desousa@inesc-id.pt,"de Sousa, Jose/L-6859-2015; V√©stias, M√°rio/H-9953-2012","de Sousa, Jose/0000-0001-7525-7546; V√©stias, M√°rio/0000-0001-8556-4507; D.

Due to the flexibility of the hardware, firmware, and software architectures, the platform is capable of interfacing with a wide variety of detector modules not only in medical imaging but also in homeland security applications. Analog signals from radiation detectors share similar characteristics-a pulse whose area is proportional to the deposited energy and whose leading edge is used to extract a timing signal. As a result, a generic design method of the platform is adopted for the hardware, firmware, and software architectures and implementations. The analog front-end is hosted on a module called a Detector Board, where each board can filter, combine, timestamp, and process multiple channels independently. The processed data is formatted and sent through a backplane bus to a module called Support Board, where 1 Support Board can host up to eight Detector Board modules. The data in the Support Board, coming from 8 Detector Board modules, can be aggregated or correlated (if needed) depending on the algorithm implemented or runtime mode selected. It is then sent out to a computer workstation for further processing. The number of channels (detector modules), to be processed, mandates the overall OpenPET System Configuration, which is designed to handle up to 1,024 channels using 16-channel Detector Boards in the Standard System Configuration and 16,384 channels using 32-channel Detector Boards in the Large System Configuration.","[Abu-Nimeh, Faisal T.; Ito, Jennifer; Moses, William W.; Peng, Qiyu; Choong, Woon-Seng] Univ Calif Berkeley, Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA",University of California System; University of California Berkeley; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory,"Abu-Nimeh, FT (corresponding author), Univ Calif Berkeley, Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",ftabunimeh@lbl.gov,,"Abu-Nimeh, Faisal/0000-0001-9009-9953","Office of Science, Office of Biological and Environmental Research, Medical Science Division of the U.S. Department of Energy [DE-AC02-05CH11231]; National Institutes of Health, National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering [R01EB016104]","Office of Science, Office of Biological and Environmental Research, Medical Science Division of the U.S. Department of Energy(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); National Institutes of Health, National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Biomedical Imaging & Bioengineering (NIBIB))","This work was supported in part by the Director, Office of Science, Office of Biological and Environmental Research, Medical Science Division of the U.S. Department of Energy under Contract DE-AC02-05CH11231, and in part by the National Institutes of Health, National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering under Grant R01EB016104.",,3,5,5,0,8,IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC,PISCATAWAY,"445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA",0018-9499,1558-1578,,IEEE T NUCL SCI,IEEE Trans.

Peer-production and contribution cultures are enfolded in a dynamic of resistance and appropriation in relation to capitalism. Open-source and contribution-based cultural processes have been critiqued as tending towards bureaucracy or becoming enfolded in a never-ending neoliberal imaginary from which escape or transcendence become impossible. An examination of the values expressed within a peer-production community challenges these perspectives and shows how ""operational pragmatics"" can provide moral justifications through reference to matters of principle and matters of design. Conflating these matters complicates claims about the inherent virtues of participation, especially in technical cultures. A qualitative analysis of an open-source hardware project shows how competing moral justifications unfold, and how the challenges that they pose to capitalism may be tenuous or temporary because of the way that justificatory regimes work within technology development under capitalism.","[Powell, Alison B.] London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, Dept Media & Commun, London, England",University of London; London School Economics & Political Science,"Powell, AB (corresponding author), London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, Dept Media & Commun, London, England.",a.powell@lse.ac.uk,,"Powell, Alison/0000-0001-5780-9132",,,,,32,5,5,0,4,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",1753-9129,1753-9137,,COMMUN CULT CRIT,Commun.

Lay description The concept of open-source technology stems from the developmental model of accessibility and ease of use, enabling an environment of continual improvement and open communication. This approach has the potential to dramatically change many fields of study including that of microscope use in research settings. Automated microscopy is often a challenging and inaccessible field due to the cost and non-interchangeable stages, the flat plate on which samples are placed for analysis. This paper presents a low-cost, open source microscope 3-D stage. A RepRap 3-D printer was converted to an optical microscope equipped with a customized, 3-D printed holder for a USB microscope. Precision measurements were determined to have an average error of 10 ?m at the maximum speed and 27 ?m at the minimum recorded speed. Accuracy tests yielded an error of 0.15%. The machine is a true 3-D stage and thus able to operate with USB microscopes or conventional desktop microscopes. Because it is larger than all current commercial alternative systems, it is capable of high depth images over unprecedented areas and complex geometries. The repeatibility is below 2-D microscope stages, but testing shows that it is adequate for the majority of scientific applications.

The growing application of smart manufacturing systems and the expansion of the Industry 4.0 model have created a need for new teaching platforms for education, rapid application development, and testing. This research addresses this need with a proposal for a model of working environment monitoring in smart manufacturing, based on emerging wireless sensor technologies and the message queuing telemetry transport (MQTT) protocol. In accordance with the proposed model, a testing platform was developed. The testing platform was built on open-source hardware and software components. The testing platform was used for the validation of the model within the presented experimental environment. The results showed that the proposed model could be developed by mainly using open-source components, which can then be used to simulate different scenarios, applications, and target systems.

It was shown that electrically stimulating the brain can be used to produce simple visual impressions of light blobs (phosphenes). This technology, using electrodes placed on top of the visual cortex, was successfully used to give blind people some degree of visual impression of their surrounding. However, this perception is very far away from natural sight. For developing the next generation of visual prostheses, real-time closed-loop stimulators are required. Such a stimulator measures the actual neuronal activities and on this basis determines the required stimulation pattern. In addition, there is a desire to shrink the diameter of the applied electrodes and increase their spatial density. This leads to the challenge of designing a system that can produce arbitrary stimulation-patterns with up to +/- 70 V and with up to 25 mA while measuring neuronal signals with amplitudes in the order of mV. Furthermore, interruptions of the measurements during stimulation should be as short as possible and the system needs to scale to hundreds of electrodes. We discuss how such a system and especially its current pumps and input protection need to be designed and which problems arise. We condense our findings into an example design for which we provide all design files (boards, firmwares and software) as open-source. This is a first step in taking the existing open-sourcewww.open-ephys.org recording system and converting it into a closed-loop experimental setup for neuro-prosthetic research. (C) 2019 The Authors.

There is, however, a considerable barrier to entering this field, requiring expertise in engineering, hardware and software development, and significant time and financial commitment. Here, we present a comprehensive, open-source hardware and software solution to implement a head-fixed environment for rodent behaviors (HERBs). Our solution provides access to three frequently used experimental frameworks (two-alternative forced choice, Go-NoGo, or passive sensory stimulus presentation) in a single package. The required hardware can be built at a relatively low cost compared with commercially available solutions, from off-the-shelf components. Our graphical user interface-based software provides great experimental flexibility and requires no programming experience for either installation or use. Furthermore, an HERBs takes advantage of motorized components that allow the precise, temporal separation of behavioral phases (stimulus presentation, delays, response window and reward). Overall, we present a solution that will allow laboratories to join the growing community of systems neuroscience research at a substantially lower cost of entry.","[Ozgur, Ali; Bin Park, Soo; Flores, Abigail Yap; Oijala, Mikko; Lur, Gyorgy] Univ Calif Irvine, Irvine, CA 92697 USA",University of California System; University of California Irvine,"Lur, G (corresponding author), Univ Calif Irvine, Irvine, CA 92697 USA.",glur@uci.edu,,"Ozgur, Ali/0000-0003-2278-0549; Park, Soo Bin/0000-0002-5948-9811",Whitehall Foundation [2018-12-09]; National Institute of Mental Health Grant [R01-MH-123686]; National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke Grant [R01-NS-127785],Whitehall Foundation; National Institute of Mental Health Grant(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH)); National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke Grant(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Neurological Disorders & Stroke (NINDS)),"These studies were funded by Whitehall Foundation Grant 2018-12-09 (to G.L.), National Institute of Mental Health Grant R01-MH-123686 (to G.L.), and National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke Grant R01-NS-127785 (to G.L.).",,64,1,1,0,1,SOC NEUROSCIENCE,WASHINGTON,"11 DUPONT CIRCLE, NW, STE 500, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA",,2373-2822,,ENEURO,eNeuro,JUN,2023,10,6,,,,,,,0018-23.2023,10.1523/ENEURO.0018-23.2023,http://dx.doi.org/10.1523/ENEURO.0018-23.2023,,,15,Neurosciences,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Neurosciences & Neurology,T9LO6,37286343,"gold, Green Published",,,8/15/24,WOS:001081128400001,,0,57,,,

One parameter to assess the water transparency is the diffuse attenuation coefficient. However, the number of subsurface irradiance measurements obtained with conventional instrumentation is relatively low, due to instrument costs and the logistic requirements to provide regular and autonomous observations. In recent years, the citizen science concept has increased the number of environmental observations, both in time and space. The recent technological advances in embedded systems and sensors also enable volunteers (citizens) to create their own devices (known as Do-It-Yourself or DIY technologies). In this paper, a DIY instrument to measure irradiance at different depths and automatically calculate the diffuse attenuation K-d coefficient is presented. The instrument, named KdUINO, is based on an encapsulated low-cost photonic sensor and Arduino (an open-hardware platform for the data acquisition). The whole instrument has been successfully operated and the data validated comparing the KdUINO measurements with the commercial instruments.

Currently, the application of these approaches is severely limited by the availability of appropriate instrumentation and by the ability to communicate experimental protocols, results and analyses. To address these issues, we have developed a low-cost, yet sophisticated open-source scientific instrument designed to enable communities of researchers, plant breeders, educators, farmers and citizen scientists to collect high-quality field data on a large scale. The MultispeQ provides measurements in the field or laboratory of both, environmental conditions (light intensity and quality, temperature, humidity, CO2 levels, time and location) and useful plant phenotypes, including photosynthetic parameters-photosystem II quantum yield (FII), non-photochemical exciton quenching (NPQ), photosystem II photoinhibition, light-driven proton translocation and thylakoid proton motive force, regulation of the chloroplast ATP synthase and potentially many others-and leaf chlorophyll and other pigments. Plant phenotype data are transmitted from the MultispeQ to mobile devices, laptops or desktop computers together with key metadata that gets saved to the PhotosynQ platform (https://photosynq.org) and provides a suite of web-based tools for sharing, visualization, filtering, dissemination and analyses. We present validation experiments, comparing MultispeQ results with established platforms, and show that it can be usefully deployed in both laboratory and field settings. We present evidence that MultispeQ can be used by communities of researchers to rapidly measure, store and analyse multiple environmental and plant properties, allowing for deeper understanding of the complex interactions between plants and their environment.","[Kuhlgert, Sebastian; Austic, Greg; Zegarac, Robert; Osei-Bonsu, Isaac; Hoh, Donghee; Bi, Kevin; TerAvest, Dan; Kramer, David M.] Michigan State Univ, MSU DOE Plant Res Lab, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA; [Chilvers, Martin I.; Roth, Mitchell G.] Michigan State Univ, Dept Plant Soil & Microbial Sci, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA; [Chilvers, Martin I.; Roth, Mitchell G.] Michigan State Univ, Grad Program Genet, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA; [Weebadde, Prabode] Venturit Inc, E Lansing, MI USA",United States Department of Energy (DOE); Michigan State University; Michigan State University; Michigan State University,"Kramer, DM (corresponding author), Michigan State Univ, MSU DOE Plant Res Lab, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA.",kramerd8@cns.msu.edu,"Chilvers, Martin I/A-3548-2010; Osei-Bonsu, Isaac/K-2911-2019; Roth, Mitchell/AAS-5685-2020; Kramer, David/B-9588-2016","Osei-Bonsu, Isaac/0000-0002-4764-1951; Roth, Mitchell/0000-0002-0798-9312; Kramer, David/0000-0003-2181-6888; Hoh, Donghee/0000-0002-0221-6484; Kuhlgert, Sebastian/0000-0002-0108-6921","U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), Office of Science, Basic Energy Sciences (BES) [DE-FG02-91ER20021]; MSU AgBioResearch program; USAID; McKnight Foundation","U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), Office of Science, Basic Energy Sciences (BES)(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); MSU AgBioResearch program; USAID(United States Agency for International Development (USAID)); McKnight Foundation","The development and testing of the MultispeQ device and PhotosynQ platform (contributions from S.K., G.A., D.T. and D.M.K.) were supported by the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), Office of Science, Basic Energy Sciences (BES) under Award no.

This manuscript concerns designing a wireless sensor network system that facilitates open-source hardware platforms, ZigBee and Raspberry Pi. The embedded system architecture combines the gateway node of the wireless sensor network, database server, and web server in one single-board computer (SBC) hardware platform. The design reduces power consumption and cost by developing better scalability and lesser sensors units to improve sending and receiving data. The use of Raspberry Pi in the design enhances flexibility and reduces the cost. Further, using the Python code in programming minimizes the codes of the components and avoids errors. The choice of the Raspbian operating system for Raspberries has resulted in higher quality, better stability, and a smoother scalable operating system. Raspberry Pi acts as a base station for the ZigBee protocol. Additionally, data can be transferred remotely at the base station via the website. The advantage of using python in the programming makes the work on the Raspberry easier and faster, and the language learning becomes easier than before. The other advantage of this technique is to allow sending the data to any Raspberry by clicking special buttons on the GUI, capability to work with both multicast-and unicast-based communication schemes, and to work as router and end tag(E52) to enable sending the real-time data to the nearest router. Analytically, the new design provides a maximum transmit power of 20 dBm12 compared to 18 dBs and increase the output power increases by a little more than 2 dB.","[Hasan, Saja Zaid] Minist Elect, Informat Technol Ctr, Baghdad, Iraq; [Sharqi, Sajjad Hasan] Minist Elect, Planning & Studies Off, Baghdad, Iraq; [Gaaz, Tayser Sumer] Al Furat Al Awsat Tech Univ, Tech Coll Al Musaib, Babil, Iraq; [Al-Amiery, Ahmed A.] Univ Technol Baghdad, Energy & Renewable Energies Technol Ctr, Baghdad, Iraq",Al-Furat Al-Awsat Technical University; University of Technology- Iraq,"Gaaz, TS (corresponding author), Al Furat Al Awsat Tech Univ, Tech Coll Al Musaib, Babil, Iraq.",taysersumer@atu.edu.iq,"Al-Amiery, Ahmed/C-1520-2013","Al-Amiery, Ahmed/0000-0003-1033-4904",,,,,29,0,0,0,2,TAYLORS UNIV SDN BHD,SELANGOR,"1 JALAN SS15-8, SUBANG JAYA, SELANGOR, 47500, MALAYSIA",,1823-4690,,J ENG SCI TECHNOL,J.

The well-known simultaneous localization and mapping problem of mobile robots has been addressed in the literaturewithout specifically taking into account the robot's motion control tasks. Moreover, its implementation can cost more than the robot itself. Robot motion control strategies developed in the literature either 1) rely on sophisticated hardware platforms, 2) assume noise-free environment, or 3) are based on abstract theories, which are validated using computer simulations only. The current work solves the navigation and mapping problems of mobile robots using open-source hardware and range-only measurements from a network of radio sources. The hardware platform used in this work is customized such that it is cost-effective and easy-to-implement, addressing the aforementioned issues in developing motion control strategies. The current strategy permits the robot to estimate its position and orientation and builds a map of its operating environment using radio frequency signals received from radio sources. It then navigates through a path defined by a set of two-dimensional points on the ground using a motion control strategy in cooperation with a computational intelligence tool. The proposed robot navigation and mapping scheme was tested in an indoor laboratory environment and its performance was compared with the simulation counterpart using a commercial robot simulator.","[Miah, Md Suruz; Knoll, Jacob; Hevrdejs, Kyle] Bradley Univ, Elect & Comp Engn Dept, Peoria, IL 61625 USA",Bradley University,"Miah, MS (corresponding author), Bradley Univ, Elect & Comp Engn Dept, Peoria, IL 61625 USA.",smiah@bradley.edu,,"Miah, Md Suruz/0000-0001-6533-0770",Research Excellence Award grant; Caterpillar Fellowship Award grant of Bradley University,Research Excellence Award grant; Caterpillar Fellowship Award grant of Bradley University,This work was supported in part by a Research Excellence Award grant and in part by Caterpillar Fellowship Award grant of Bradley University.

However, developing such equipment at a small scale for academic research is not available owing to highly priced commercial products. Fortunately, building and experimenting with open-source hardware enable the academic utilization of cableless seismic equipment with relatively low cost. This study aims to develop a cableless seismic acquisition module using Arduino. A cableless seismic system requires the combination of signal sensing, simple pre-processing, and data storage in a single device. A conventional geophone is used as the sensor that detects the seismic wave signal. In addition, it is connected to an Arduino circuit that plays a role in implementing the processing and storing module for the detected signals. Three main functions are implemented in the Arduino module: preprocessing, A/D conversion, and data storage.

Within these communities for peer production, citizens can apply cutting-edge technologies in DIY projects. In recent decades, mushrooming makerspaces and hacklabs were embraced by the tech industry and governments alike. Feminist makerspaces and hacklabs, however, as they are centred around a queer feminist agenda, have raised eyebrows. In order to foster diversity in tech development, they create safer spaces for self-expression. Here, feminist lay(wo)men* (To emphasise that the category 'Woman' is constructed and that more people than only those who identify as women are being included, one uses the sign * after the term 'women' ), makers, designers, artists and tinkerers experiment with open-source hardware and software. Art and design projects emerging from feminist hacklabs focus on issues of representation and democratic participation in digital media, as well as on ways of reclaiming one's own body. This article tries to unpack how, after an exhibition on sexual health norms, a feminist hacklab was attacked by local right-wing and conservative politicians. The attack resulted in the defunding of the feminist hacklab. But it also started a transformation process within the collective, as members became aware of critical interferences of diffracting marginalisations. The crisis triggered a discussion on how each member was threatened to very different degrees; for example, there was more at stake for members depending on their legal status in the country. The right-wing and conservative campaign against the feminist hacklab damaged the initiative, but at the same time it pushed the collective to generate increased vehemence and resilience.","[Wuschitz, Stefanie] Inst Philosophie Literatur Wissenschafts & Techni, Berlin, Germany",,"Wuschitz, S (corresponding author), TU Berlin, Hochschulprogramm DiGiTal, Inst Hist & Philosophy Sci Technol & Literature, Fac Human & Educ Sci 1, Berlin, Germany.",wuschitz@protonmail.com,,"Wuschitz, Stefanie/0000-0003-2519-449X",Berliner Hochschulprogramm DiGiTal,Berliner Hochschulprogramm DiGiTal,"The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This work was supported by the Berliner Hochschulprogramm DiGiTal.",,114,1,1,0,1,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",1464-7001,1741-2773,,FEM THEOR,Fem.

Raspberry PI is a platform supporting Do-I t-Yourself project and education applications across the world. The development is part of Biosignal PI, an open hardware platform focusing in quick prototyping of physiological measurement instrumentation. The SoC used for sensing cardiac biopotential is the ADAS1000, and for the EBI measurement is the AD5933. The recordings were wirelessly transmitted through Bluetooth to a PC, where the waveforms were displayed, and hemodynamic parameters such as heart rate, stroke volume, ejection time and cardiac output were extracted from the ICG and ECG recordings. These results show how Raspberry PI can be used for quick prototyping using relatively widely available and affordable components, for supporting developers in research and engineering education.

The objective of this paper is to propose a methodology to improve the operation of these systems, associated with small and medium-sized livestock farms, in insular and isolated systems such as the Canary Islands. An Integrated and Resilient System (IRS) for monitoring and measuring operational variables quasi-continuous and in situ is proposed. Low-cost technology and open source hardware are employed, as well as application of the IoT (Internet of Things) strategies to share and analyze the information collected in the cloud. In view of the high degree of resilience and the simplicity of this type of technology, as well as its low cost, it is concluded that it is feasible to create a measurement system with these characteristics that can be used for NTSW parameterization, and other purposes. Satisfactory results were obtained for several parameters (ambient temperature, relative humidity, UV radiation, atmospheric pressure). It is presented as a novel proposal based mainly on low-cost technology and free software with which to improve the NTSW operation process.","[Rodriguez-Perez, Melania L.; Mendieta-Pino, Carlos A.; Brito-Espino, Saulo; Ramos-Martin, Alejandro] Univ Las Palmas de Gran Canaria ULPGC, Inst Environm Studies & Nat Resources i UNAT, Las Palmas Gran Canaria 35214, Spain; [Mendieta-Pino, Carlos A.; Ramos-Martin, Alejandro] Univ Las Palmas de Gran Canaria ULPGC, Dept Proc Engn, Las Palmas Gran Canaria 35214, Spain",Universidad de Las Palmas de Gran Canaria; Universidad de Las Palmas de Gran Canaria,"Rodr√≠guez-P√©rez, ML (corresponding author), Univ Las Palmas de Gran Canaria ULPGC, Inst Environm Studies & Nat Resources i UNAT, Las Palmas Gran Canaria 35214, Spain.",melania.rodriguez103@alu.ulpgc.es,"Pino, Carlos/ISS-0593-2023; Ramos, Alejandro/H-4351-2015","Ramos, Alejandro/0000-0001-5759-4469; Mendieta Pino, Carlos Alberto/0000-0002-1808-0112",INTERREG V-A Cooperation Spain-Portugal MAC (Madeira-Azores-Canarias) MITIMAC program [MAC2/1.1a/263],INTERREG V-A Cooperation Spain-Portugal MAC (Madeira-Azores-Canarias) MITIMAC program,research has been co-funded by the INTERREG V-A Cooperation Spain-Portugal MAC (Madeira-Azores-Canarias) MITIMAC program through project MAC2/1.1a/263.,,115,3,3,0,1,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2073-4441,,WATER-SUI,Water,SEP,2022,14,18,,,,,,,2917,10.3390/w14182917,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w14182917,,,20,Environmental Sciences; Water Resources,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Water Resources,4R8YD,,"gold, Green Published",,,8/15/24,WOS:000857041300001,,0,70,,,

In this sense, the do-it-yourself (DIY) approach to build new low-cost systems or verify the correspondence of low-cost systems compared to professional devices allows the spread of application possibilities. Following this trend, the authors aim to present a complete DIY and replicable procedure to evaluate the performance of a low-cost video luminance meter consisting of a Raspberry Pi and a camera module. The method initially consists of designing and developing a LED panel and a light cube that serves as reference illuminance sources. The luminance distribution along the two reference light sources is determined using a Konica Minolta luminance meter. With this approach, it is possible to identify an area for each light source with an almost equal luminance value. By applying a frame that covers part of the panel and shows only the area with nearly homogeneous luminance values and applying the two systems in a dark space in front of the low-cost video luminance meter mounted on a professional reference camera photometer LMK mobile air, it is possible to check the discrepancy in luminance values between the low-cost and professional systems when pointing different homogeneous light sources. In doing so, we primarily consider the peripheral shading effect, better known as the vignetting effect. We then differentiate the correction factor S of the Radiance Pcomb function to better match the luminance values of the low-cost system to the professional device. We also introduce an algorithm to differentiate the S factor depending on the light source. In general, the DIY calibration process described in the paper is time-consuming. However, the subsequent applications in various real-life scenarios allow us to verify the satisfactory performance of the low-cost system in terms of luminance mapping and glare evaluation compared to a professional device.","[Salamone, Francesco; Sibilio, Sergio] Natl Res Council Italy ITC CNR, Construct Technol Inst, Via Lombardia 49, I-20098 San Giuliano Milanese, MI, Italy; [Salamone, Francesco; Sibilio, Sergio; Masullo, Massimiliano] Univ Campania Luigi Vanvitelli, Dipartimento Architettura & Disegno Ind, Via San Lorenzo, I-81031 Aversa, CE, Italy",Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche (CNR); Istituto per le Tecnologie della Costruzione (ITC-CNR); Universita della Campania Vanvitelli,"Salamone, F (corresponding author), Natl Res Council Italy ITC CNR, Construct Technol Inst, Via Lombardia 49, I-20098 San Giuliano Milanese, MI, Italy.; Salamone, F (corresponding author), Univ Campania Luigi Vanvitelli, Dipartimento Architettura & Disegno Ind, Via San Lorenzo, I-81031 Aversa, CE, Italy.",salamone@itc.cnr.it,"Sibilio, Sergio/AAH-1345-2019; Salamone, Francesco/O-4213-2015; Masullo, Massimiliano/I-3728-2019","Sibilio, Sergio/0000-0002-8750-5401; Salamone, Francesco/0000-0003-3215-3979; Masullo, Massimiliano/0000-0002-0958-7536",,,,,23,2,2,2,3,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,1424-8220,,SENSORS-BASEL,Sensors,OCT,2022,22,20,,,,,,,7706,10.3390/s22207706,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/s22207706,,,20,"Chemistry, Analytical; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Instruments & Instrumentation",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Chemistry; Engineering; Instruments & Instrumentation,5Q1SI,36298068,"Green Published, gold",,,8/15/24,WOS:000873618400001,,0,72,,,

To emulate real-world scenarios, we built a hardware setup that included a system to replay and process different types of physiological signals and test the accuracy of the instantaneous phase and amplitude estimates. The results show that the system can provide a precise and reliable estimation of the phase even in the challenging scenario of dealing with high-frequency oscillations (similar to 250 Hz) in real-time.

Researchers are increasingly concerned about exposure to glyphosate and the risks its poses to human health, since it may cause substantial damage, even in small doses. The detection of glyphosate residues in waters is not a simple task, as it requires complex and expensive equipment and qualified personnel. New technological tools need to be designed and developed, based on proven, but also cost-efficient, agile, and user-friendly, analytical techniques, which can be used in the field and in the lab, enabled by connectivity and multiplatform software applications. This article presents the design, development, and testing of an innovative low-cost visible and near-infrared (VIS-NIR) spectrometer (called SpectroGLY), based on Internet of Things (IoT) technologies, which allows potential glyphosate contamination in waters to be detected. SpectroGLY combines the functional concept of a traditional lab spectrometer with the IoT technological concept, enabling the integration of several connectivity options for rural and urban settings and digital visualization and monitoring platforms (Mobile App and Dashboard Web). Thanks to its portability, it can be used in any context and provides results in 10 min. Additionally, it is unnecessary to transfer the sample to a laboratory (optimizing time, costs, and the capacity for corrective actions by the authorities). In short, this article proposes an innovative, low-cost, agile, and highly promising solution to avoid potential intoxications that may occur due to ingestion of water contaminated by this herbicide.","[Aira, Javier] Univ Castilla La Mancha, Int Doctoral Sch, Albacete 02071, Spain; [Olivares, Teresa] Univ Castilla La Mancha, Dept Comp Syst, Albacete 02071, Spain; [Delicado, Francisco M.] Univ Castilla La Mancha, Dept Comp Engn, Albacete 02071, Spain",Universidad de Castilla-La Mancha; Universidad de Castilla-La Mancha; Universidad de Castilla-La Mancha,"Aira, J (corresponding author), Univ Castilla La Mancha, Int Doctoral Sch, Albacete 02071, Spain.",jorgejavier.aira@alu.uclm.es; teresa.olivares@uclm.es; francisco.delicado@uclm.es,"Aira, Javier/HSF-7977-2023; Delicado, Francisco M./H-1594-2015","Aira, Javier/0000-0003-0879-1380; Olivares Montes, Teresa/0000-0001-9512-2745; Delicado, Francisco M./0000-0002-2150-7797","Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation [European Regional Development Fund (ERDF), EU funds] [RTI2018-098156-B-C52]; MCIN/AEI [PID2021-123627OB-C52]; ERDF A way to make Europe","Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation [European Regional Development Fund (ERDF), EU funds]; MCIN/AEI; ERDF A way to make Europe","This work was supported in part by the Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation [European Regional Development Fund (ERDF), EU funds] under Project RTI2018-098156-B-C52, in part by MCIN/AEI/10.13039/501100011033 under Grant PID2021-123627OB-C52, and in part by ERDF A way to make Europe.

The development of commercial devices has thus far focused on the quality of measurements and their robustness in all field cases. However, both their costs and lack of flexibility to adapt to specific applications have limited their prevalence in the environmental sector. This article presents the development of a low-cost, open hardware resistivity meter to provide the scientific community with a robust and flexible tool for small-scale experiments. Called OhmPi, this basic resistivity meter features current injection and measurement functions associated with a multiplexer that allows performing automatic measurements with up to 32 electrodes (at a cost of less than $500). The device was first tested using a soil-analog electrical circuit to verify the reliability and robustness of the measurements. Results show that OhmPi offers a wide range of resistance measurements, from 0.2 to 1000 O, for contact resistances between 100 and 5000 O. Measurements were then carried out on a small field experiment, in demonstrating good stability of the OhmPi measurements, as well as a strong correlation with the output of a commercial reference instrument.

The characteristic concern that educationalists in Moroccan universities have to reconsider in this pandemic period should not be beyond rethinking new pedagogical alternatives including approaches, methods, techniques and didactic materials which can successfully assist practioners of the teaching and learning process to keep up with the current alterations. Practical work (PW) is an indispensable type of teaching in scientific and technical training and meets a real complementary need through real, remote or virtual laboratories. Students can consolidate what they have learnt and develop analytical skills by comparing experimental results with those obtained during the manipulation. In this context, the Laboratory of Engineering Sciences and Energy Management (LASIME) at the Superior School of Technology of Agadir has developed a low-cost platform called LABERSIME installed in the cloud (LMS, IDE) and equipped with an embedded system to drive real laboratory equipment and perform experiments qualitatively more efficient than those in face-to-face mode.

Due to the increasing threats of information leakage, it is imperative to provide a secure RISC-V ecosystem to defend against malicious software exploits. Toward this goal, data-flow integrity (DFI) is employed as a strict security policy for enforcing the legitimacy of each data access, thereby filtering out most of the attack exploits. However, due to the intensive computations needed by DFI, there are only limited proposals successfully implementing partial DFI with low performance overhead. Moreover, all the previous studies failed to enforce the complete DFI policy in a real hardware platform, while trading off security strength for performance efficiency. To provide RISC-V architecture with high security enforcement and low performance overhead, we leverage the open-source Rocket Chip and propose RvDfi, the first complete DFI implementation based on RISC-V architecture with only 17.8% performance overhead on average and 3.9% in minimum, incurring much less performance loss compared to the 166.3% overhead caused by previous complete DFI implementation.","[Feng, Lang; Li, Luyi; Zhang, Haochen; Wang, Zhongfeng] Nanjing Univ, Sch Elect Sci & Engn, Nanjing 210023, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Huang, Jiayi] UC Santa Barbara, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA",Nanjing University; University of California System; University of California Santa Barbara,"Wang, ZF (corresponding author), Nanjing Univ, Sch Elect Sci & Engn, Nanjing 210023, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.",flang@nju.edu.cn; jyhuang@ucsb.edu; luyli@smail.nju.edu.cn; 181180179@smail.nju.edu.cn; zfwang@nju.edu.cn,"zhang, haochen/AAF-3192-2020; Li, Luyi/D-8446-2016; Huang, Jiayi/Y-2795-2019","Huang, Jiayi/0000-0003-4011-6668; Wang, Zhongfeng/0000-0002-7227-4786; Feng, Lang/0000-0001-9943-0550",National Natural Science Foundation of China [61774082]; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities [2021300341]; Key Research Plan of Jiangsu Province of China [BE2019003-4],National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities); Key Research Plan of Jiangsu Province of China,"This work was supported in part by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant 61774082, in part by the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities under Grant 2021300341, and in part by the Key Research Plan of Jiangsu Province of China under Grant BE2019003-4.",,37,1,1,1,19,IEEE COMPUTER SOC,LOS ALAMITOS,"10662 LOS VAQUEROS CIRCLE, PO BOX 3014, LOS ALAMITOS, CA 90720-1314 USA",0018-9340,1557-9956,,IEEE T COMPUT,IEEE Trans.

Today, developments in NdFeb magnets have caused these magnets to become essential elements in many technology fields. NdFeB magnets are widely used in the engines of hybrid electric vehicles due to the maximum energy product (BHmax). In addition, usage of NdFeB in applications such as magnetic resonance imaging, electric motors, various generators and in large-scale or small-scale wind energy generators have increased significantly. In this study, before the production of NdFeB magnets, a virtual laboratory platform which can be used in research and development studies and production is realized.The developed virtual platform is designed and run as a desktop application. In future studies, web based applications will be developed by using open source hardware.In the study, mathematical functions were obtained from data related to B-r(permanent magnetism), H-c(magnetic coercivity), BHmax, and Curie temperature obtained in researches on different NdFeB alloys in real laboratory.The virtual laboratory platform was prepared with the obtained functions.

In the RoboCup MSL, two teams of five autonomous robots play on an 18- x 12-m field. Equipped with sensors and on-board computers, each robot should be able to perceive the environment, make decision and control itself to play the soccer game autonomously. Design/methodology/approach - This paper presents the design of our soccer robots, participating in RoboCup MSL. The mechanical platform, electrical architecture and software framework are discussed separately. The mechanical platform is designed modularly, so easy maintainability is achieved; the electronic architecture is built on industrial standards using PC-based control technique, which results in high robustness and reliability during the intensive and fierce MSL games; the software is developed upon the open-source Robot Operating System (ROS); thus, the advantages of ROS such as modularity, portability and expansibility are inherited. Findings - Based on this paper and the open-source hardware and software, the MSL robots can be re-developed easily to participate in the RoboCup MSL. The robots can also be used in other research and education fields, especially for multi-robot systems and distributed artificial intelligence.

It combines: (i) custom printed circuit boards (PCBs) with RFM69 frequency shift keying (FSK) radio frequency (RF) transceivers for wireless sensors, control nodes, and USB gateway, (ii) a Raspberry Pi 3B with custom firmware acting as either a centralized or distributed backhaul, and (iii) a custom dockerized application for the backend called Brood that serves as the director software managing message brokering via Message Queuing Telemetry Transport (MQTT) protocol using VerneMQ, database storage using InfluxDB, and data visualization using Grafana. The platform is built around the idea of a private, secure, and open technology for the built environment. Among its many applications, the platform allows occupants to investigate anomalies in energy usage, environmental quality, and thermal performance via a comprehensive dashboard with rich querying capabilities. It also includes multiple frontends to view and analyze building activity data, which can be used directly in building controls or to provide recommendations on how to increase operational efficiency or improve operating conditions. Here, we demonstrate three distinct applications of the Elemental platform, including: (1) deployment in a research lab for long-term data collection and automated analysis, (2) use as a full-home energy and environmental monitoring solution, and (3) fault and anomaly detection and diagnostics of individual building systems at the zone-level. Through these applications we demonstrate that the platform allows easy and virtually unlimited datalogging, monitoring, and analysis of real-time sensor data with low setup costs. Low-power sensor nodes placed in abundance in a building can also provide precise and immediate fault-detection, allowing for tuning equipment for more efficient operation and faster maintenance during the lifetime of the building.","[Ali, Akram Syed; Heidarinejad, Mohammad; Stephens, Brent] IIT, Dept Civil Architectural & Environm Engn, Chicago, IL 60616 USA; [Cote, Christopher] Entropealabs, Chicago, IL 60626 USA",Illinois Institute of Technology,"Ali, AS; Stephens, B (corresponding author), IIT, Dept Civil Architectural & Environm Engn, Chicago, IL 60616 USA.",aali21@hawk.iit.edu; chris@entropealabs.com; muh182@iit.edu; brent@iit.edu,,"Ali, Akram/0000-0003-0248-0493; Heidarinejad, Mohammad/0000-0002-3064-825X; Stephens, Brent/0000-0002-0177-6703",Franklin Energy; ASHRAE New Investigator Award,Franklin Energy; ASHRAE New Investigator Award,"This work was funded by Franklin Energy, by an ASHRAE New Investigator Award to Brent Stephens, and by an ASHRAE New Investigator Award to Mohammad Heidarinejad.",,49,35,37,6,34,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,1424-8220,,SENSORS-BASEL,Sensors,2-Sep,2019,19,18,,,,,,,4017,10.3390/s19184017,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/s19184017,,,20,"Chemistry, Analytical; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Instruments & Instrumentation",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Chemistry; Engineering; Instruments & Instrumentation,JC3OK,31540360,"gold, Green Published",,,8/15/24,WOS:000489187800202,,0,88,,,

In this study, we have developed an electronic system based on the Arduino Open Hardware platform, to which we have added temperature and humidity sensors to adapt the system to the particular conditions of beehive management. The system has been used to record changes in temperature and humidity inside hives and assess bees' thermoregulation adaptability within colonies in hives with opened-screened bottom boards; an interesting management tool for controlling the harmful Varroa destructor mite as compared to beehives with conventional closed bottom boards. The results revealed that bee colonies were able to thermoregulate in hives with open anti-Varroa bottom boards to the same degree as those in conventional bottom board hives even under winter conditions in a mediterranean climate, thus indicating that there are no additional risks associated with the use of open-screened bottom board models.

The regression models developed by re-searchers to predict physicochemical attributes using spectra remain theoretical due to lack of mechanism to integrate the developed models back into proprietary devices. This poses challenge for commercial adaptation of this technology in commercial food quality supply chain. The present study addresses this research gap by presenting first of its kind innovative approach to classify tomatoes based on lycopene content using chemometrics-machine learning framework driven portable short-wave near infra-red (SWNIR) spectropho-tometer developed by integration of open-source hardware (AS7265x multispectral chipset having wavelength range 410-940 nanometre (nm), Arduino Uno microcontroller) and software (R platform), housed in ergo-nomically designed and 3-dimension printed cabinet ensuring noise-free spectra acquisition. The lycopene content was observed to have strong negative correlation with wavelengths (nm) 485, 560 and 585 at rho = - 0.65, - 0.70, - 0.70, whereas strong positive correlation with 760 nm at rho = +0.64. Similar associations were qual-itatively observed using principal component analysis. Atypical of literature, feature selection was performed based on analysis of variance and 14 wavelengths which exhibited statistically significant difference with respect to 15-days storage study (p <= 0.05) were selected for model development. Chemometrics-machine learning framework was used for development of optimised probabilistic and non-probabilistic models including logistic regression, Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), Random Forest (RF), Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) models using 10-fold cross validation subjected to 80-20% train-test split of the dataset. In agreement with literature, 500-750 nm wavelength range dominated the classification of lycopene content. Notably, specific wavelengths for logistic regression (560 nm), LDA (730 nm, 645 nm, 560 nm, 535 nm), RF (760 nm, 585 nm, 560 nm, 645 nm), and ANN (585 nm, 560 nm) significantly influenced outcome instances across classifiers. Accuracy obtained from confusion matrix on test dataset was used as performance metric to compare different models. Logistic regression and RF showcased accuracy of 80%, LDA and SVM at 90% while ANN outperformed all models with accuracy of 95%. This study successfully augmented technological advancement in field of spectroscopy for non-invasive quality assessment of fruit. It is recommended to conduct similar studies on other climacteric fruits for wider adoption of this technology.","[Sharma, Arun; Kumar, Ritesh] CSIR Cent Sci Instruments Org, Sect 30, Chandigarh 160030, India; [Sharma, Arun; Kumar, Ritesh] Acad Sci & Innovat Res AcSIR, Ghaziabad 201002, India; [Sharma, Arun; Kumar, Nishant; Saxena, Vikas] Natl Inst Food Technol Entrepreneurship & Manageme, Sonipat 131028, Haryana, India",Council of Scientific & Industrial Research (CSIR) - India; CSIR - Central Scientific Instruments Organisation (CSIO); Academy of Scientific & Innovative Research (AcSIR),"Sharma, A (corresponding author), Natl Inst Food Technol Entrepreneurship & Manageme, Sonipat 131028, Haryana, India.",arun.sharma@niftem.ac.in,"Kumar, Nishant/AAW-7613-2021; Kumar, Nishant/K-9395-2018","Kumar, Nishant/0000-0003-0124-9337; Sharma, Arun/0000-0002-0460-3939; Kumar, Nishant/0000-0003-0187-7544",,,,,78,1,1,7,8,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0924-2031,1873-3697,,VIB SPECTROSC,Vib.

The open source PAPR can be fabricated with a low-cost 3-D printer and widely available components for less than $150, replacing commercial conversion kits saving 85% or full-fledged proprietary PAPRs saving over 90%. The parametric designs allow for adaptation to other core components and can be custom fit specifically to fire-fighter equipment, including their suspenders. The open source PAPR has controllable air flow and its design enables breathing even if the fan is disconnected or if the battery dies.

The objective of this work was to design a low cost. open hardware. platform for multi-sensor measurements including water content at different depths, air and soil temperatures. The system is based on an open-source ARDUINO microcontroller-board, programmed in a simple integrated development environment (IDE). Low cost high-frequency dielectric probes were used in the platform and lab tested on three non-saline soils (ECe1: 2.5 < 0.1 mS/cm). Empirical calibration curves were subjected to cross-validation (leave-one-out method), and normalized root mean square error (NRMSE) were respectively 0.09 for the overall model, 0.09 for the sandy soil, 0.07 for the clay loam and 0.08 for the sandy loam. The overall model (pooled soil data) fitted the data very well (R-2 = 0.89) showing a high stability, being able to generate very similar RMSEs during training and validation (RMSEtraining = 2.63; RMSEvalidation = 2.61). Data recorded on the card were automatically sent to a remote server allowing repeated field-data quality checks. This work provides a framework for the replication and upgrading of a customized low cost platform, consistent with the open source approach whereby sharing information on equipment design and software facilitates the adoption and continuous improvement of existing technologies.","[Bitella, Giovanni; Bochicchio, Rocco; Perniola, Michele; Amato, Mariana] Univ Basilicata, Sch Agr Forestry Food & Environm Sci, I-85100 Potenza, Italy; [Rossi, Roberta] Consiglio Ric Sperimentaz Agr, Res Unit Cropping Syst Dry Environm CRA SCA, I-70125 Bari, Italy",University of Basilicata; Consiglio per la Ricerca in Agricoltura e L'analisi Dell'economia Agraria (CREA),"Rossi, R (corresponding author), Consiglio Ric Sperimentaz Agr, Res Unit Cropping Syst Dry Environm CRA SCA, I-70125 Bari, Italy.",gianfranco.bitella@gmail.com; roberta.rossi@entecra.it; bochicchiorocco@gmail.com; michele.perniola@unibas.it; mariana.amato@unibas.it,"Rossi, Roberta/KDO-5368-2024","AMATO, Mariana/0000-0003-0179-8969","PSR 124 ""IRRISOL integrated system for differential irrigation management through high resolution differential mapping""; Regione Campania; DRD [215 07/06/2013]; Codice CUP [B55C11003040007]","PSR 124 ""IRRISOL integrated system for differential irrigation management through high resolution differential mapping""; Regione Campania(Regione Campania); DRD; Codice CUP","This work was partly funded by PSR 124 ""IRRISOL integrated system for differential irrigation management through high resolution differential mapping"".

This study provides designs of an open source bottle roller that is compatible with distributed digital manufacturing using 3-D printed parts and readily-available commercial components. The experimental results show that the open source bot-tle roller can be fabricated for CAD$210 (about USD$150) in materials, which is 86% less expensive than the most affordable proprietary bottle roller on the market. The design, how-ever, is more robust with enhanced capabilities. The design can be adapted to the user's needs, but is already compatible with incubators with a low profile (dimensions 50 cm x46 cm x8.8 cm) and capable of being operated at elevated temperatures. The systems can be adjusted to revolves from 1 to 200 RPM, exceeding the rotational speed of most commercial systems. The open source bottle roller as tested has a capacity greater than 1.2 kg and can roll twelve 100 mL bottles simultaneously. Validation testing showed that it can operate for days at 80 RPM without human intervention or monitoring for days at both room temperature and elevated temperatures (50 & DEG;C). Future work includes adapting the designs for different sizes and for different fabrication techniques to further reduce costs and increase flexibility.& COPY; 2023 The Author(s).

Since manual phenotyping has limited efficiency, highthroughput phenotyping methods are recently popularized owing to progress in sensor and image processing technologies. However, in a size-limited breeding field, which is common in Japan and other Asian countries, it is challenging to introduce large machinery in the field or fly unmanned aerial vehicles over the field. In this study, we developed a ground-based high-throughput field phenotyping rover that could be easily introduced to a field regardless of the scale and location of the field even without special facilities. We also made the field rover open-source hardware, making its system available to public for easy modification, so that anyone can build one for their own use at a low cost. The trial run of the field rover revealed that it allowed the collection of detailed remote-sensing images of plants and quantitative analyses based on the images. The results suggest that the field rover developed in this study could allow efficient phenotyping of plants especially in a small breeding field.","[Kuroki, Ken; Nasuda, Shuhei] Kyoto Univ, Grad Sch Agr, Sakyo Ku, Kyoto 6068502, Japan; [Kuroki, Ken] Univ Tokyo, Grad Sch Sci, Bunkyo Ku, 7-3-1 Hongo, Tokyo 1130033, Japan; [Yan, Kai] LabRomance Inc, 1-3-29-2F Ureshino, Fujimino, Saitama 3560056, Japan; [Iwata, Hiroyoshi] Univ Tokyo, Grad Sch Agr & Life Sci, Bunkyo Ku, 1-1-1 Yayoi, Tokyo 1138657, Japan; [Shimizu, Kentaro K.] Univ Zurich, Dept Evolutionary Biol & Environm Studies, CH-8057 Zurich, Switzerland; [Shimizu, Kentaro K.; Tameshige, Toshiaki] Yokohama City Univ, Kihara Inst Biol Res, Totsuka Ku, 641-12 Maioka, Yokohama, Kanagawa 2440813, Japan; [Tameshige, Toshiaki] Niigata Univ, Fac Sci, Dept Biol, Nishi Ku, 8050 Ikarashi 2 No Cho, Niigata 9502181, Japan; [Guo, Wei] Univ Tokyo, Grad Sch Agr & Life Sci, 1-1-1 Midori, Nishitokyo, Tokyo 1880002, Japan",Kyoto University; University of Tokyo; University of Tokyo; University of Zurich; Yokohama City University; Niigata University; University of Tokyo,"Guo, W (corresponding author), Univ Tokyo, Grad Sch Agr & Life Sci, 1-1-1 Midori, Nishitokyo, Tokyo 1880002, Japan.",guowei@g.ecc.u-tokyo.ac.jp,"Guo, Wei/AAK-8956-2021; Tameshige, Toshiaki/ISB-1723-2023","Guo, Wei/0000-0002-3017-5464; Kuroki, Ken/0000-0002-2096-2747; Iwata, Hiroyoshi/0000-0002-6747-7036","JST, CREST, Japan [JPMJCR16O2, JPMJCR16O3]; Swiss National Science Foundation [31003A_ 182318]; Australia GRDC project [UOQ2002-008RTX]; Swiss National Science Foundation (SNF) [31003A_182318] Funding Source: Swiss National Science Foundation (SNF); Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [22K21352] Funding Source: KAKEN","JST, CREST, Japan(Core Research for Evolutional Science and Technology (CREST)); Swiss National Science Foundation(Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF)); Australia GRDC project; Swiss National Science Foundation (SNF)(Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF)); Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))","The authors would like to thank the staff of NBRP-Wheat, the field technical staff, and the members of the Laboratory of Plant Breeding, Graduate School of Agriculture, Kyoto University for supporting this study.

In this regard, a new WC model is proposed to simultaneously accommodate these distinct and essential features. In this open-source hardware project, the design, analysis and fabrication of a new active commode WC for indoor applications are performed. Materials and method A field survey is conducted to identify the requirements of users so as to choose specific features and design constraints for the WC. In this multipurpose self-propelled model, a temporarily detachable circular section is fitted in the seat position to access the water closet bowl. This hinged portion can be released by gravity before reaching above the closet basin. After the toilet usage, the circular lid can be brought back to the initial seating using a lever mechanism and a spring-loaded lock restrains its downward movement. Thereafter, it can be used as an ordinary WC for indoor applications. Moreover, a small wheel with 22 in diameter and removable hand-rests ensured the transferability between utilities. A CAD model is prepared and numerical simulation is performed to verify the structural stability of the design. Results The optimized model is fabricated using standard manufacturing practices and is delivered to different persons with disabilities to collect user feedback. A systematic skill test is conducted to validate the compliance of the prototype with the user requirements including transferability and independent restroom access. Conclusion The opinions from most of the users are positive which categorically indicated that the proposed design addresses the multipurpose mobility requirements at indoors.","[Akhil, J.

The paper describes a comprehensive project including the electronic design, the firmware loaded on Arduino, and the Java-coded graphical user interface to load data in a computer (PC or Mac) for processing. The prototype was tested by measuring the calibration curve of a detector. As detection element, an active poly(vinyl chloride)based membrane was used, doped with cetyltrimethylammonium dodecylsulphate (CTA(+)-DS-). The experimental measures of emf indicate Nernstian behaviour with the CTA(+) content of test solutions, as it was described in the literature, proving the validity of the developed prototype.

This study describes the development of an affordable and robust robotic beer pourer using low-cost sensors, Arduino (R) boards, Lego (R) building blocks and servo motors for prototyping. The RoboBEER is also coupled with video capture capabilities (iPhone 5S) and automated post hoc computer vision analysis algorithms to assess different parameters based on foamability, bubble size, alcohol content, temperature, carbon dioxide release and beer color. Results have shown that parameters obtained from different beers by only using the RoboBEER can be used for their classification according to quality and fermentation type. Results were compared to sensory analysis techniques using principal component analysis (PCA) and artificial neural networks (ANN) techniques. The PCA from RoboBEER data explained 73% of variability within the data. From sensory analysis, the PCA explained 67% of the variability and combining RoboBEER and Sensory data, the PCA explained only 59% of data variability. The ANN technique for pattern recognition allowed creating a classification model from the parameters obtained with RoboBEER, achieving 92.4% accuracy in the classification according to quality and fermentation type, which is consistent with the PCA results using data only from RoboBEER. The repeatability and objectivity of beer assessment offered by the RoboBEER could translate into the development of an important practical tool for food scientists, consumers and retail companies to determine differences within beers based on the specific parameters studied.

In this new scenario, advanced devices are needed for real-time monitoring and control of the energy flow and power quality (PQ). Ideally, the data collected by Internet of Thing (IoT) sensors should be shared to central cloud systems for online and off-line analysis. In this paper openZmeter (oZm) is presented as an advanced low-cost and open-source hardware device for high-precision energy and power quality measurement in low-voltage power systems. An analog front end (AFE) stage is designed and developed for the acquisition, conditioning, and processing of power signals. This AFE can be stacked on available quadcore embedded ARM boards. The proposed hardware is capable of adapting voltage signals up to 800 V AC/DC and currents up to thousands of amperes using different probes. The oZm device is described as a fully autonomous open-source system for the computation and visualization of PQ events and consumed/generated energy, along with full details of its hardware implementation. It also has the ability to send data to central cloud management systems. Given the small size of the hardware design and considering that it allows measurements under a wide range of operating conditions, oZm can be used both as bulk metering or as metering/submetering device for individual appliances. The design is released as open hardware and therefore is presented to the community as a powerful tool for general usage.","[Viciana, Eduardo; Alcayde, Alfredo; Montoya, Francisco G.; Banos, Raul; Arrabal-Campos, Francisco M.; Manzano-Agugliaro, Francisco] Univ Almeria, Dept Engn, Almeria 04120, Spain",Universidad de Almeria,"Montoya, FG (corresponding author), Univ Almeria, Dept Engn, Almeria 04120, Spain.",edu.vg82@gmail.com; aalcayde@ual.es; pagilm@ual.es; rbanos@ual.es; fmarrabal@ual.es; fmanzano@ual.es,"Garc√≠a, Alfredo Alcayde/R-8627-2018; Ba√±os, Ra√∫l/D-6433-2013; Manzano-Agugliaro, Francisco/K-8184-2014; Gil Montoya, Francisco/L-8067-2014; Arrabal Campos, Francisco Manuel/L-8544-2014","Garc√≠a, Alfredo Alcayde/0000-0002-2776-089X; Ba√±os, Ra√∫l/0000-0001-7844-4902; Manzano-Agugliaro, Francisco/0000-0002-0085-030X; Gil Montoya, Francisco/0000-0003-4105-565X; Arrabal Campos, Francisco Manuel/0000-0002-5510-6297; Viciana Gamez, Eduardo/0000-0001-9206-4105",Regional Government of Andalusia (ceiA3 project) at the University of Almeria,Regional Government of Andalusia (ceiA3 project) at the University of Almeria,This research was funded by the Regional Government of Andalusia (ceiA3 project) at the University of Almeria.,,49,39,39,1,11,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,1424-8220,,SENSORS-BASEL,Sensors,1-Feb,2019,19,3,,,,,,,627,10.3390/s19030627,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/s19030627,,,25,"Chemistry, Analytical; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Instruments & Instrumentation",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Chemistry; Engineering; Instruments & Instrumentation,HN1IR,30717225,"Green Published, gold, Green Submitted",,,8/15/24,WOS:000459941200190,,0,101,,,

CTDs, devices that measure salinity (via conductivity), temperature, and depth in the ocean, are essential for almost all marine scientific research, whether oceanography, ecology, conservation, or management. But CTDs are often cost- prohibitive, making this essential tool of ocean science inaccessible to the majority of ocean knowledge seekers. The OpenCTD is a low-cost, open-source oceanographic instrument, built from relatively accessible components, that allows ocean knowledge seekers to collect data on salinity, temperature, and depth in waters as deep as 140 m, with depth accurate to <1 cm, temperature to +/- 0.1 degrees C, and a salinity error rate of 1%, with a 90% response time of 1 second. The OpenCTD is an open, adaptable platform that allows users to integrate other sensors (e.g., dissolved oxygen, pH) to fit their specific needs or questions. The utility of the OpenCTD for both STEM education and community oceanography is demonstrated in real-world case studies. The OpenCTD offers researchers, community groups, educators, managers, and other ocean knowledge seekers the ability to collect baseline data about their local waters at a fraction of the cost of commercial alternatives and, for most use cases, with comparable data quality.","[Thaler, Andrew] Univ Maryland, Ctr Environm Sci, Horn Point Lab, Cambridge, MD 21613 USA; [Thaler, Andrew] Blackbeard Biol Sci & Environm Advisors, St Michaels, MD 21663 USA; [Sturdivant, S.

This raises costs and retards innovation. Open-source hardware tools exist for implementing these processes individually; however, they are not easily integrated with other designs. The Broadly Reconfigurable and Expandable Automation Device (BREAD) is a framework that provides many open-source devices which can be connected to create more complex data acquisition and control systems. This article explores the feasibility of using BREAD plug-and-play open hardware to quickly design and test monitoring and control electronics for an industrial materials processing prototype pyrolysis reactor. Generally, pilot-scale pyrolysis plants are expensive custom designed systems. The plug-and-play prototype approach was first tested by connecting it to the pyrolysis reactor and ensuring that it can measure temperature and actuate heaters and a stirring motor. Next, a single circuit board system was created and tested using the designs from the BREAD prototype to reduce the number of microcontrollers required. Both open-source control systems were capable of reliably running the pyrolysis reactor continuously, achieving equivalent performance to a state-of-the-art commercial controller with a ten-fold reduction in the overall cost of control. Open-source, plug-and-play hardware provides a reliable avenue for researchers to quickly develop data acquisition and control electronics for industrial-scale experiments.","[Hafting, Finn K.; Pearce, Joshua M.] Western Univ, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, 1151 Richmond St N, London, ON N6A 3K7, Canada; [Kulas, Daniel; Chipkar, Sarvada; Wisniewski, Stefan; Shonnard, David] Michigan Technol Univ, Dept Chem Engn, 1400 Townsend Dr, Houghton, MI 49931 USA; [Michels, Etienne] Michigan Technol Univ, Dept Biomed Engn, 1400 Townsend Dr, Houghton, MI 49931 USA; [Pearce, Joshua M.] Western Univ, Ivey Sch Business, 1151 Richmond St N, London, ON N6A 3K7, Canada",Western University (University of Western Ontario); Michigan Technological University; Michigan Technological University; Western University (University of Western Ontario),"Pearce, JM (corresponding author), Western Univ, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, 1151 Richmond St N, London, ON N6A 3K7, Canada.; Pearce, JM (corresponding author), Western Univ, Ivey Sch Business, 1151 Richmond St N, London, ON N6A 3K7, Canada.",fhafting@uwo.ca; dgkulas@mtu.edu; ebmichel@mtu.edu; sgwisnie@mtu.edu; drshonna@mtu.edu; joshua.pearce@uwo.ca,"; Pearce, Joshua/C-9240-2013","Kulas, Daniel/0000-0003-3165-3816; Pearce, Joshua/0000-0001-9802-3056; Chipkar, Sarvada/0000-0002-5525-5321",Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency,Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency(United States Department of DefenseDefense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA)),No Statement Available,,67,0,0,1,1,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2079-9292,,ELECTRONICS-SWITZ,Electronics,DEC,2023,12,24,,,,,,,4893,10.3390/electronics12244893,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/electronics12244893,,,19,"Computer Science, Information Systems; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Physics, Applied",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Computer Science; Engineering; Physics,DG6N6,,"Green Published, gold",,,8/15/24,WOS:001130915600001,,0,104,,,

To correct this, we developed an automated system for group-housed mice based on radio frequency identification: the Mouse Position Surveillance System (MoPSS). The system uses an Arduino microcontroller with compatible components; it is affordable and easy to rebuild for every laboratory because it uses free and open-source software and open-source hardware with the RFID readers as the only proprietary component. The MoPSS was validated using female C57BL/6J mice and manual video comparison. It proved to be accurate even for fast-moving mice (up to 100% accuracy after logical reconstruction), and is already implemented in several studies in our laboratory. Here, we provide the complete construction description as well as the validation data and the results of an example experiment. This tracking system will allow group-based preference testing with individually identified mice to be carried out in a convenient manner.

The proposed design is implemented in Chisel hardware construction language, an open-source hardware library. It has been evaluated in various hardware platforms such as FPGAs, embedded systems and ASICs with various technology nodes and design flows. In the PYNQ-Z1 board, RECO-ASCON can be mapped to five processors in total with a Micro-Blaze soft-core processor for streaming data to all of them while running at 200 MHz without producing any timing violations. Moreover, mapping the proposed RECO-ASCON processor on the Nexsys4-DDR Xilinx Kit (ARTIX-7 chip) would cost & SIM; two times fewer resources and run 1.25 x faster than the existing implementation of just one of the ASCON hash functions on the same family of the chip. We implement the proposed processor in 28 nm industry technology with commercial design flow, it achieves a maximum frequency of 1.12 GHz while achieving highest energy efficiency compared to the state-of-the-art implementations. The total area is only 9170.82 um2 in 28 nm. To further evaluate the design, we also implement it with all open-source design tools and process technology libraries in 45 nm, it achieves 1 GHz maximum frequency and consumes only 18225 um2 in 45 nm.

The resuscitation system is based on the Arduino controller with a real-time operating system installed on a largely RepRap 3-D printable parametric component-based structure. The cost of the materials for the system is under $170, which makes it affordable for replication by makers around the world. The device provides a controlled breathing mode with tidal volumes from 100 to 800 mL, breathing rates from 5 to 40 breaths/minute, and inspiratory-to-expiratory ratio from 1:1 to 1:4. The system is designed for reliability and scalability of measurement circuits through the use of the serial peripheral interface and has the ability to connect additional hardware due to the object-oriented algorithmic approach. Experimental results after testing on an artificial lung for peak inspiratory pressure (PIP), respiratory rate (RR), positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP), tidal volume, proximal pressure, and lung pressure demonstrate repeatability and accuracy exceeding human capabilities in BVM-based manual ventilation. Future work is necessary to further develop and test the system to make it acceptable for deployment outside of emergencies such as with COVID-19 pandemic in clinical environments, however, the nature of the design is such that desired features are relatively easy to add using protocols and parametric design files provided.

Many assessment methods use assumptions instead of measured data because it is cumbersome, time-intensive, and cost-intensive to acquire up-to-date, on-site measured data. This work bridges this gap by presenting the design of an open-source, wireless sensor network (WSN) that is easy to program, manufacture, modify, and deploy. The version of the WSN presented here measures air temperature, relative humidity, supply and return temperature of hot water from the heating system and the radiators, heat flux through the walls and the windows, luminosity, oil flow, electricity, window opening times, and CO2-concentration. The modularity of the WSN allows it to be extended with the addition of new types of sensors to the existing hardware framework. The data is streamed to an online database, allowing monitoring of the measurements in near real-time. The cost and performance of the sensor network are intended to be as good as or better than the existing solutions. The current cost for one temperature sensor node starts at 116 USD. The observed battery lifetime reaches up to a year for a five-minute sampling interval. The average installation time for a sensor node is 7 min. We describe the hardware architecture, software architecture, cost of the WSN, along with results from co-location tests, and a deployment in an occupied building.","[Frei, Mario; Deb, Chirag; Stadler, Ruben; Schlueter, Arno] ETH, Chair Architecture & Bldg Syst, Stefano Franscini Pl 1, CH-8093 Zurich, Switzerland; [Nagy, Zoltan] Univ Texas Austin, Intelligent Environm Lab, 301 E Dean Keeton St St C1700, Austin, TX 78712 USA",Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich; University of Texas System; University of Texas Austin,"Frei, M (corresponding author), ETH, Chair Architecture & Bldg Syst, Stefano Franscini Pl 1, CH-8093 Zurich, Switzerland.",mario.frei@arch.ethz.ch,"Nagy, Zoltan/E-1435-2016; Schlueter, Arno/CAF-1531-2022; Deb, Chirag/AAA-9486-2021; Frei, Mario/T-2871-2018","Nagy, Zoltan/0000-0002-6014-3228; Schlueter, Arno/0000-0003-4999-2218; Frei, Mario/0000-0003-2193-5211",Office for Water and Energy of the Canton St. Gallen (AWE); Swiss Innovation Agency Innosuisse,Office for Water and Energy of the Canton St. Gallen (AWE); Swiss Innovation Agency Innosuisse,We thank our colleagues Martin Gahwiler and Lukas Gautschi from the electronics workshop of the physics department of our institution.

With few exceptions, such test systems are discontinuous. They require exposure of the biological test material in small units, such as multiwell plates, during prolonged incubation periods, and do not allow online read-outs. It is mostly due to these shortcomings that applications in continuous monitoring of, e.g., drinking or surface water quality are largely missing. We propose the use of pipetting robots that can be used to automatically exchange samples in multiwell plates with fresh samples in a semi-static manner, as a potential solution to overcome these limitations. In this study, we developed a simple and low-cost, versatile pipetting robot constructed partly using open source hardware that has a small footprint and can be used for online monitoring of water quality by means of an automated whole-organism bioassay. We tested its precision in automated 2-fold dilution series and used it for exposure of zebrafish embryos (Danio rerio) a common model species in ecotoxicology to cadmium chloride and permethrin. We found that, compared to conventional static or semi-static exposure scenarios, effects of the two chemicals in zebrafish embryos generally occurred at lower concentrations, and analytically verified that the increased frequency of media exchange resulted in a greater availability of the chemical. In combination with advanced detection systems this custom-made pipetting robot has the potential to become a valuable tool in future monitoring strategies for drinking and surface water.","[Steffens, Sebastian; Nuesser, Leonie; Seiler, Thomas-Benjamin; Hollert, Henner; Brinkmann, Markus] Rhein Westfal TH Aachen, Dept Ecosyst Anal, Inst Environm Res, ABBt Aachen Biol & Biotechnol, Aachen, Germany; [Ruchter, Nadine; Schumann, Mark] Univ Duisburg Essen, Aquat Ecol & Ctr Water & Environm Res ZWU, Essen, Germany; [Doering, Ricarda; Cofalla, Catrina; Schuettrumpf, Holger] Rhein Westfal TH Aachen, Inst Hydraul Engn & Water Resources Management, Aachen, Germany; [Ostfeld, Avi] Technion Israel Inst Technol, Environm Water & Agr Engn, Fac Civil & Environm Engn, Haifa, Israel; [Salomons, Elad] OptiWater, Haifa, Israel; [Hollert, Henner] Nanjing Univ, Sch Environm, State Key Lab Pollut Control & Resource Reuse, Nanjing, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Hollert, Henner] Chongqing Univ, Coll Resources & Environm Sci, Chongqing, Peoples R China; [Hollert, Henner] Tongji Univ, Key Lab Yangtze Water Environm, Minist Educ, Shanghai, Peoples R China; [Brinkmann, Markus] Univ Saskatchewan, Sch Environm & Sustainabil, Saskatoon, SK, Canada",RWTH Aachen University; University of Duisburg Essen; RWTH Aachen University; Technion Israel Institute of Technology; Nanjing University; Chongqing University; Tongji University; University of Saskatchewan,"Brinkmann, M (corresponding author), Univ Saskatchewan, Sch Environm & Sustainabil, Saskatoon, SK, Canada.",markus.brinkmann@usask.ca,"Mueller, Leonie Katharina/KGL-3411-2024; Hollert, Henner/A-1027-2009; Sch√ºttrumpf, Holger/B-1177-2010; Brinkmann, Markus/L-3879-2013","Mueller, Leonie Katharina/0000-0003-4323-9129; Hollert, Henner/0000-0001-5776-5619; Sch√ºttrumpf, Holger/0000-0002-0104-0499; Bruell, Catrina/0000-0003-0079-4093; Seiler, Thomas-Benjamin/0000-0001-8127-510X; Salomons, Elad/0000-0002-1522-1805; Brinkmann, Markus/0000-0002-4985-263X; Ostfeld, Avi/0000-0001-9112-6079","German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF); Ministry of Science, Technology and Space (MOST), Israel; SOLUTIONS project from the European Union's Seventh Framework Programme [603437]; German National Academic Foundation ('Studienstiftung des deutschen Volkes'); OptiWater","German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF)(Federal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF)); Ministry of Science, Technology and Space (MOST), Israel(Ministry of Science, Technology and Space (MOST), Israel); SOLUTIONS project from the European Union's Seventh Framework Programme(European Union (EU)); German National Academic Foundation ('Studienstiftung des deutschen Volkes'); OptiWater","The present study was conducted as part of the project W3-Hydro ""Water Quality Event Detection for Urban Water Security and Urban Water Management Based on Hydrotoxicological Investigations"" within the Joint Germanlsraeli Water Technology Research Program that received funds from the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) and the Ministry of Science, Technology and Space (MOST), Israel.

They are seen as a key to advancements in such fields. A robotic is being used to assure precision and reliability. Some bigger companies like amazon use robotics to achieve stability and speed up their productions. In real-life, robots are mostly used in environments that contain uncertainties events. Additionally, interruptions occur there. Determining several performance quantities such as the execution time, throughput, power dissipation and energy under severe circumstances is crucial in the fields where robotics are used. This paper uses the developed framework earlier on a robotic manipulator to estimate average power dissipation, also known as power consumption, and average energy. Subsequently, a comparison analysis is conducted using several free tools such as Power Gadget, HW Monitor, Sidebar Diagnostics and Open Hardware Monitor. Those free tools are chosen since they are available with no extra hidden charges, and they are easy to download and use. The aim of that analysis is to find the differences between the average estimated value using mathematical equations and the actual ones from those tools. The analysis is performed on a machine running on a Windows based system. The results that obtained indicate that the estimated/predicted values of the dissipated power and energy are close to the actual values. Likewise, the error between those figures varies between 6% to 11%. This variation happens because the used machine is affected by its specifications, especially the number of cores of its CPU and the clock frequency.","[Alsheikhy, Ahmed] Northern Border Univ, Coll Engn, Dept Elect Engn, Ar Ar, Saudi Arabia",Northern Border University,"Alsheikhy, A (corresponding author), Northern Border Univ, Coll Engn, Dept Elect Engn, Ar Ar, Saudi Arabia.",aalsheikhy@nbu.edu.sa,"Alsheikhy, Ahmed/AAJ-7904-2021","Alsheikhy, Ahmed/0000-0002-9811-0341",,,,,17,1,1,0,0,UNION SCIENTISTS BULGARIA,SOFIA,"1505 SOFIA 39, MADRID BLVD, FLR 2, SOFIA, 00000, BULGARIA",1313-8251,,,INT J INF TECHNOL SE,Int.

Because it is additive, it enables geometries usually unattainable by other technologies. Because it is digitally controlled, its output is easily modulated, even during operation. Combined with the development of functional materials and their micrometer precision, it can be applicable in a wide range of fields beyond the traditional graphic industry, such as medical diagnosis, electronics manufacturing, and the fabrication of microlenses. In this work, a solution based on open-source hardware and software was implemented instead of choosing a commercial alternative, making the most of inkjet flexibility in terms of inks, substrates, and actuation signal. First, a piezoelectric printhead from MicroFab, driven by an ArduinoDue, was mounted in a 3D printer adapted to ensure precise movement in three dimensions. Then, a monitoring system using a USB digital microscope and a computational algorithm was integrated. Both systems combined allow the printing and measurement of microdroplets by digital regulation of a unipolar signal. Finally, based on a theoretical model and a set of experimentally collected samples, the curve that relates the unipolar signal amplitude to the size of the microdroplets was estimated with an acceptable range of prediction uncertainty.","[Cavaleiro de Ferreira, Beatriz; Coutinho, Tiago; Cardoso, Susana] Beatriz Tiago Miguel Susana Cardoso, Rua Alves Redol 9, P-1000029 Lisbon, Portugal; [Cavaleiro de Ferreira, Beatriz; Cardoso, Susana] Univ Lisbon, Inst Super Tecn, P-1049001 Lisbon, Portugal; [Ayala Botto, Miguel] Univ Lisbon, Inst Super Tecn, IDMEC, P-1049001 Lisbon, Portugal",Universidade de Lisboa; Universidade de Lisboa,"de Ferreira, BC (corresponding author), Beatriz Tiago Miguel Susana Cardoso, Rua Alves Redol 9, P-1000029 Lisbon, Portugal.; de Ferreira, BC (corresponding author), Univ Lisbon, Inst Super Tecn, P-1049001 Lisbon, Portugal.",beatriz.ferreira@inesc-mn.pt,"Cardoso, Susana/B-6199-2013; Ayala Botto, Miguel/D-4211-2016","Cardoso, Susana/0000-0001-6913-6529; Coutinho, Tiago/0000-0003-2153-7539; Ferreira, Maria Beatriz/0000-0001-7248-3847; Ayala Botto, Miguel/0000-0002-9416-3892","FCT, through IDMEC, under LAETA [UIDB/50022/2020]; European Structural & Investment Funds through the COMPETE Program; FCT-Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia [UID/05367/2020]","FCT, through IDMEC, under LAETA(Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia (FCT)); European Structural & Investment Funds through the COMPETE Program; FCT-Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia(Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia (FCT))","This work was supported by FCT, through IDMEC, under LAETA, project UIDB/50022/2020.

To offer more tradeoff, we can integrate statically scheduled micro-architecture and use dynamic binary translation (DBT) for task migration. However, in a system where performance and energy consumption are a prime concern, the translation overhead has to be kept as low as possible. In this paper, we present Hybrid-DBT, an open-source, hardware accelerated DBT system targeting VLIW cores. Three different hardware accelerators have been designed to speed-up critical steps of the translation process.

The Minimum Viable Option (MVO) automation platform was developed to address these hurdles and fulfill an unmet need. Consumer 3D printing enabled rapid iterative prototyping to allow for a variety of instrumentation and assay setups and procedures. Three MVO versions have been produced. MVOv1.1 successfully performed part of a clinical assay, and results were comparable to those of commercial automation. Raspberry Pi 3 Model B (RPI3) single-board computers with Sense Hardware Attached on Top (HAT) and Raspberry Pi Camera Module V2 hardware were remotely accessed and evaluated for their suitability to qualify the latest MVOv1.2 platform. Sense HAT temperature, barometric pressure, and relative humidity sensors were stable in climate-controlled environments and are useful in identifying appropriate laboratory spaces for automation placement. The RPI3 with camera plus digital dial indicator logged axis travel experiments. RPI3 with camera and Sense HAT as a light source showed promise when used for photometric dispensing tests.

However, commercially available devices are unaffordable to most potential users in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), limiting access to many patients who could benefit from this treatment. This study aimed to design and test a cheap and easy-to-build negative pressure device and provide its detailed open-source description, thereby enabling free replication. Methods: the negative pressure device was built using off-the-shelf materials available via e-commerce and was based on a small pump, a pressure transducer, and the simplest Arduino controller with a digital display (total retail cost <= 75 US$). The device allows the user to set any therapeutic range of intermittent negative pressure and has two independent safety mechanisms. The performance of the low-cost device was carefully tested on the bench using a phantom wound, producing a realistic exudate flow rate. Results: the device generates the pressure patterns set by the user (25-175 mmHg of vacuum pressure, 0-60 min periods) and can drain exudate flows within the clinical range (up to 1 L/h). Conclusions: a novel, low-cost, easy-to-build negative pressure device for wound healing displays excellent technical performance. The open-source hardware description provided here, which allows for free replication and use in LMICs, will facilitate the application and wider utilization of this therapy to patients.","[Farre, Ramon; Rodriguez-Lazaro, Miguel A.; Otero, Jorge] Univ Barcelona, Fac Med & Ciencies Salut, Unitat Biofis & Bioengn, Barcelona 08036, Spain; [Farre, Ramon; Otero, Jorge] CIBER Enfermedades Resp, Madrid 28029, Spain; [Farre, Ramon; Castro, Pedro; Compta, Yaroslau] Inst Investigac Biomed August Pi Sunyer, Barcelona 08036, Spain; [Gonzalez-Martin, Julian] Univ Barcelona, ISGlobal, Hosp Clin, Microbiol Dept,CDB, Barcelona 08036, Spain; [Gonzalez-Martin, Julian] Inst Salud Carlos III, CIBER Infect Dis CIBERINFEC, Madrid 28029, Spain; [Castro, Pedro; Hospital, Teresa] Hosp Clin Barcelona, Internal Med Dept, Intens Care Unit, Barcelona 08036, Spain; [Compta, Yaroslau] Hosp Clin Barcelona, Inst Neurociencies, Serv Neurol, Parkinsons Dis & Movement Disorders Unit, Barcelona 08036, Spain; [Compta, Yaroslau] Univ Barcelona, Maeztu Ctr, Inst Neurociencies, Barcelona 08036, Spain; [Solana, Gorka] Univ Save, Fac Engenharias & Tecnol, Maxixe, Mozambique; [Gozal, David] Univ Missouri, Sch Med, Dept Child Hlth, Columbia, MO 65212 USA",University of Barcelona; CIBER - Centro de Investigacion Biomedica en Red; CIBERES; University of Barcelona; Hospital Clinic de Barcelona; IDIBAPS; University of Barcelona; Hospital Clinic de Barcelona; ISGlobal; Instituto de Salud Carlos III; University of Barcelona; Hospital Clinic de Barcelona; University of Barcelona; Hospital Clinic de Barcelona; University of Barcelona; University of Missouri System; University of Missouri Columbia,"Farr√©, R (corresponding author), Univ Barcelona, Fac Med & Ciencies Salut, Unitat Biofis & Bioengn, Barcelona 08036, Spain.; Farr√©, R (corresponding author), CIBER Enfermedades Resp, Madrid 28029, Spain.; Farr√©, R (corresponding author), Inst Investigac Biomed August Pi Sunyer, Barcelona 08036, Spain.",rfarre@ub.edu,"Castro, Pedro/AAF-4792-2021; Castro, Pedro/AAG-2513-2021; Gonzalez-Martin, Julian/AGS-6795-2022; Farre, Ramon/L-2664-2017","Castro, Pedro/0000-0002-6118-8970; Castro, Pedro/0000-0002-6118-8970; Gonzalez-Martin, Julian/0000-0001-7248-6706; Gozal, David/0000-0001-8195-6036; Farre, Ramon/0000-0002-9084-7824; Solana Arteche, Gorka/0000-0002-1212-0574",,,,,38,2,2,0,2,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2077-0383,,J CLIN MED,J.

In this article, we propose the Portiloop, a deep learning-based, portable and low-cost closed-loop stimulation system able to target specific brain oscillations. We first document open-hardware implementations that can be constructed from commercially available components. We also provide a fast, lightweight neural network model and an exploration algorithm that automatically optimizes the model hyperparameters to the desired brain oscillation. Finally, we validate the technology on a challenging test case of real-time sleep spindle detection, with results comparable to off-line expert performance on the Massive Online Data Annotation spindle dataset (MODA; group consensus). Software and plans are available to the community as an open science initiative to encourage further development and advance closed-loop neuroscience research [https://github.com/Portiloop].","[Valenchon, Nicolas; Bouteiller, Yann; L'Heureux, Xavier; Sobral, Milo; Beltrame, Giovanni] Univ Montreal, MISTLab Polytechn, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [Jourde, Hugo R.; Coffey, Emily B.

Recently, the appearance of RISC-V open-source ISA creates new possibilities to develop customized computing platforms with high savings in the non-recurring engineering costs. Moreover, the current trends toward open-source hardware frameworks are aimed to reduce design time and cost for complex system-on-chip architectures. Therefore, modularity and re-usability of hardware components are major challenges for flexible hardware architectures. The motivation behind this work is to introduce a modular cluster-based many-core architecture for FPGA accelerators that is re-usable and flexible tailored to implement different many-core taxonomies with less design time and costs by using regular and replicated sets of computing, memory, and interconnection blocks. The proposed many-core architecture is built using multiple processing clusters coupled with a NoC for communication which allows a high degree of design scalability. The processing cluster inside features a configurable multi-core architecture consisting of multiple RISC-V processing elements (PE) tightly coupled with a bus-based interconnection for intra-cluster communication using parameterized scratchpad shared memory. Each PE features a single RISC-V core with a tightly coupled parameterized scratchpad local memory and generic AXI interface. Evaluation results demonstrate that the proposed architecture features a scalable computing performance of 501 MOp/s for 4 clusters and 878 MOp/s for 8 clusters. Moreover, a scalable memory bandwidth up to 4.3 GB/s is achieved for 9 clusters with a power consumption of 1.4 W per cluster utilizing 7.7% of on-chip memory resources. The many-core architecture is implemented and evaluated on Xilinx Virtex Ultrascale+ with the feature of changing the architecture configurations during run-time using dynamic and partial reconfiguration which provides more flexibility and re-usability.","[Kamaleldin, Ahmed; Hesham, Salma; Gohringer, Diana] Tech Univ Dresden, Adapt Dynam Syst, D-01069 Dresden, Germany; [Gohringer, Diana] Tech Univ Dresden, Ctr Tactile Internet Human In The Loop CeTI, D-01069 Dresden, Germany",Technische Universitat Dresden; Technische Universitat Dresden,"Kamaleldin, A (corresponding author), Tech Univ Dresden, Adapt Dynam Syst, D-01069 Dresden, Germany.",ahmed.kamal@tu-dresden.de,"Kamaleldin, Ahmed/HJY-1768-2023; Goehringer, Diana/ABG-4285-2021","Kamaleldin, Ahmed/0000-0002-7446-7741","Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG, German Research Foundation) [287022738 -TRR196]; TU Dresden","Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG, German Research Foundation)(German Research Foundation (DFG)); TU Dresden","This work was supported by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG, German Research Foundation) -Project-ID 287022738 -TRR196, and by the Open Access Funding by the Publication Fund of the TU Dresden.",,26,9,10,5,21,IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC,PISCATAWAY,"445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA",2169-3536,,,IEEE ACCESS,IEEE Access,,2020,8,,,,,,148812,148826,,10.1109/ACCESS.2020.3015706,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2020.3015706,,,15,"Computer Science, Information Systems; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Telecommunications",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Computer Science; Engineering; Telecommunications,ND7BH,,gold,,,8/15/24,WOS:000562057000001,,0,125,,,

This is performed thanks to the design of a methodology of using a thermal simulation tool with experimental measurements based on a low-cost open source hardware platform in order to evaluate the energy saving measures and analyse the thermal comfort and energy savings. To accomplish this, a study of the housing needs is performed a priori to later design the different actions in the rehabilitation, using if possible, ecological materials in its development. Basically, walls and ceilings are insulated, three solar air collectors are included to heat the air ventilation and decrease the heating demand, and two pellet stoves are installed. Finally, the refurbished house is modeled and simulated in EnergyPlus and compared with the indoor air temperature and relative humidity measurements, made using an Open-Source Monitoring System (OSMS) developed for this research in Arduino, obtaining results with no significant differences without the need to calibrate the system. The results of thermal comfort, heating and cooling demand and heating energy consumption of the house before and after the renovation are compared providing a decrease in thermal demand of 66% and a decrease in heating energy consumption of 50% in the winter season, where 60% of the energy consumed is contributed from renewable sources. In terms of thermal comfort, the comparison of the PPD and PMV values shows an improvement in the house in heating and cooling season.","[Ghoreishi, Kusha] Quark Arquitectura SL, Ave Las Palmeras S-N, Benalmadena 29630, Spain; [Ghoreishi, Kusha; Fernandez-Gutierrez, Alberto; Parras, Luis] Univ Malaga, Escuela Ingn Ind, C Doctor Pedro Ortiz Ramos S-N, E-29071 Malaga, Spain; [Fernandez-Hernandez, Francisco] EII Univ Malaga, Energy Res Grp, C Doctor Pedro Ortiz Ramos S-N, Malaga 29071, Spain",Universidad de Malaga,"Fern√°ndez-Hern√°ndez, F (corresponding author), EII Univ Malaga, Energy Res Grp, C Doctor Pedro Ortiz Ramos S-N, Malaga 29071, Spain.",franciscofh@uma.es,"Parras, Luis/AAG-5863-2021; Fernandez, Francisco/Q-4911-2019; Fernandez Hernandez, Francisco/E-2862-2015; Parras, Luis/B-7223-2016","Fernandez, Francisco/0000-0002-5074-1507; Fernandez Hernandez, Francisco/0000-0002-5074-1507; Fernandez Gutierrez, Alberto/0000-0002-2234-4272; Parras, Luis/0000-0002-5592-3465",,,,,39,11,11,1,14,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",,2352-7102,,J BUILD ENG,J.

Agile hardware design tools based on compiler techniques can help by quickly producing an application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) accelerator starting from a high-level algorithmic description. We present the software-defined accelerator (SODA) synthesizer, a modular and open-source hardware compiler that provides automated end-to-end synthesis from high-level software frameworks to ASIC implementation, relying on multilevel representations to progressively lower and optimize the input code. Our approach does not require the application developer to write any register-transfer level code, and it is able to reach up to 364 giga floating point operations per second (GFLOPS)/W efficiency (32-bit precision) on typical convolutional neural network operators.","[Agostini, Nicolas Bohm; Curzel, Serena; Limaye, Ankur; Castellana, Vito Giovanni; Manzano, Joseph; Tumeo, Antonino] Pacific Northwest Natl Lab, High Performance Comp Grp, Richland, WA 99354 USA; [Amatya, Vinay] Pacific Northwest Natl Lab, Richland, WA 99354 USA; [Minutoli, Marco] Pacific Northwest Natl Lab, Data Sci & Machine Intelligence Grp, Richland, WA 99354 USA; [Zhang, Jeff (Jun)] Harvard Univ, Architecture Circuits & Compilers Grp, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Brooks, David] Harvard Univ, Sch Engn & Appl Sci, Comp Sci, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Wei, Gu-Yeon] Harvard Univ, John A Paulson Sch Engineer & Appl Sci, Elect Engn & Comp Sci, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Tan, Cheng] Microsoft, Redmond, WA USA",United States Department of Energy (DOE); Pacific Northwest National Laboratory; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Pacific Northwest National Laboratory; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Pacific Northwest National Laboratory; Harvard University; Harvard University; Harvard University; Microsoft,"Agostini, NB (corresponding author), Pacific Northwest Natl Lab, High Performance Comp Grp, Richland, WA 99354 USA.",nicolas.agostini@pnnl.gov; serena.curzel@polimi.it; jeffzhang@g.harvard.edu; ankur.limaye@pnnl.gov; chengtan@microsoft.com; Vinay.amatya@pnnl.gov; marco.minutoli@pnnl.gov; vitogiovanni.castellana@pnnl.gov; joseph.manzano@pnnl.gov; dbrooks@g.harvard.edu; guyeon@seas.harvard.edu; antonino.tumeo@pnnl.gov,"Curzel, Serena/AHD-0907-2022; Limaye, Ankur/AAM-4823-2021; Manzano, Joseph/M-6850-2014","Curzel, Serena/0000-0002-8202-1627; Limaye, Ankur/0000-0001-9406-2584; Bohm Agostini, Nicolas/0000-0003-1855-3810; Manzano, Joseph/0000-0002-6616-0125; Minutoli, Marco/0000-0002-4220-1420",,,,,15,8,8,0,3,IEEE COMPUTER SOC,LOS ALAMITOS,"10662 LOS VAQUEROS CIRCLE, PO BOX 3014, LOS ALAMITOS, CA 90720-1314 USA",0272-1732,1937-4143,,IEEE MICRO,IEEE Micro,1-Sep,2022,42,5,,,,,78,88,,10.1109/MM.2022.3178580,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/MM.2022.3178580,,,11,"Computer Science, Hardware & Architecture; Computer Science, Software Engineering",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Computer Science,4O3EQ,,"Green Published, Green Submitted",,,8/15/24,WOS:000854586200002,,0,128,,,

Flight time measurement with jump-mat systems is the most common procedure for this purpose. The aim of this study was to analyze the concurrent validity and reliability of two proprietary systems (Globus and Axon) and an open-source system (Chronojump). Methods: A conditioning electric circuit governed by a controlled wave generator is designed to substitute athletes jumping on a physical mat. In order to look for possible differences associated to timekeeping by each microcontroller device, all three systems are fed by the circuit simultaneously. Results: Concurrent validity was high for the three systems. Standarized typical error of estimate (TEE) was trivial, according to MBI interpretation as well as perfect Pearson correlation coefficient. Reliability was assessed based on the coefficient of variation of flight time measure, resulting in 0.17-0.63% (0.05-0.12 cm) for Globus, 0.01% (0.09 cm) for Chronojump and 5.65-9.38% (2.15-3.53 cm) for Axon. These results show that all jump-mat system produced nearly identical measures of flight time so they can be considered valid and reliable for practical purposes. In comparison, Chronojump showed the best performance whereas Axon showed enough variability and disagreement to pose a problem in testing elite athletes. Conclusions: These experiments show that open-source jump mats are as valid and reliable as their proprietary counterparts at a lower cost. Therefore, practitioners can be confident in using Globus or Chronojump systems to test athletes' jump height because of their negligible errors and Axon system to monitor general population.","[Pueo, Basilio; Penichet-Tomas, Alfonso] Univ Alicante, Dept Sport Sci, Ctra San Vicente, Alicante, Spain; [Lipinska, Patrycja; Busko, Krzysztof] Kazimierz Wielki Univ, Inst Phys Culture, Bydgoszcz, Poland",Universitat d'Alacant; Kazimierz Wielki University,"Pueo, B (corresponding author), Univ Alicante, Dept Sports Sci, Comp Sci Res Inst, Ctra San Vicente S-N, Alicante 03690, Spain.",basilio@ua.es,"Lipinska, Patrycja Anna/KVB-7583-2024; Jimenez-Olmedo, Jose M./AAF-2879-2019; Pueo, Basilio/A-8025-2015; Penichet-Tom√°s, Alfonso/I-3826-2016; Bu≈õko, Krzysztof/ABE-7456-2020; Lipi≈Ñska, Patrycja/A-8049-2015","Lipinska, Patrycja Anna/0000-0002-8752-2623; Pueo, Basilio/0000-0003-2590-3276; Penichet-Tom√°s, Alfonso/0000-0003-0018-5589; Bu≈õko, Krzysztof/0000-0002-6456-3502;",,,,,25,25,26,2,13,"WROCLAW UNIV TECHNOLOGY, FAC COMPUTER SCIENCE & MANAGEMENT",WROCLAW,"WYBRZEZE WYSPIANSKIEGO 27, WROCLAW, 50-370, POLAND",1509-409X,,,ACTA BIOENG BIOMECH,Acta Bioeng.

It exploits robust hardware platforms and powerful software development kits to create customized drivers with advanced capabilities. Still, several restrictions may significantly reduce the performance of OpenBCI. These limitations include the need for more effective communication between computers and peripheral devices and more flexibility for fast settings under specific protocols for neurophysiological data. This paper describes a flexible and scalable OpenBCI framework for electroencephalographic (EEG) data experiments using the Cyton acquisition board with updated drivers to maximize the hardware benefits of ADS1299 platforms. The framework handles distributed computing tasks and supports multiple sampling rates, communication protocols, free electrode placement, and single marker synchronization. As a result, the OpenBCI system delivers real-time feedback and controlled execution of EEG-based clinical protocols for implementing the steps of neural recording, decoding, stimulation, and real-time analysis.

The cost, usability and power efficiency of available wildlife monitoring equipment currently inhibits full ground-level coverage of many natural systems. Developments over the last decade in technology, open science, and the sharing economy promise to bring global access to more versatile and more affordable monitoring tools, to improve coverage for conservation researchers and managers. 2. Here we describe the development and proof-of-concept of a low-cost, small-sized and low-energy acoustic detector: ""AudioMoth."" The device is open-source and programmable, with diverse applications for recording animal calls or human activity at sample rates of up to 384 kHz. We briefly outline two ongoing real-world case studies of large-scale, long-term monitoring for biodiversity and exploitation of natural resources. These studies demonstrate the potential for AudioMoth to enable a substantial shift away from passive continuous recording by individual devices, towards smart detection by networks of devices flooding large and inaccessible ecosystems. 3. The case studies demonstrate one of the smart capabilities of AudioMoth, to trigger event logging on the basis of classification algorithms that identify specific acoustic events. An algorithm to trigger recordings of the New Forest cicada (Cicadetta montana) demonstrates the potential for AudioMoth to vastly improve the spatial and temporal coverage of surveys for the presence of cryptic animals. An algorithm for logging gunshot events has potential to identify a shotgun blast in tropical rainforest at distances of up to 500 m, extending to 1 km with continuous recording. 4. AudioMoth is more energy efficient than currently available passive acoustic monitoring devices, giving it considerably greater portability and longevity in the field with smaller batteries. At a build cost of similar to US$43 per unit, AudioMoth has potential for varied applications in large-scale, long-term acoustic surveys. With continuing developments in smart, energy-efficient algorithms and diminishing component costs, we are approaching the milestone of local communities being able to afford to remotely monitor their own natural resources.","[Hill, Andrew P.; Prince, Peter] Univ Southampton, Fac Phys Sci & Engn, Agents Interact & Complex Elect & Comp Sci, Southampton, Hants, England; [Covarrubias, Evelyn Pina; Doncaster, C.

The growth rate of leaves at different growth stages determines the overall LAI, which is used by crop growth models (CGM) for simulating yield. Consequently, precise phenotyping of the leaves can help elucidate phenological processes relating to resource capturing. A stable system for acquiring images and a strong data processing backend play a vital role in reducing throughput time and increasing accuracy of calculations, compared to manual analysis. However, most available solutions are not dynamic, as they use color-based segmentation, which fails to capture leaves with varying shades and shapes. We have developed a system that uses a low-cost setup to acquire images and an automated pipeline to manage the data storage on the device and in the cloud. The system is powered by virtual machines that run multiple custom-trained deep learning models to segment out leaves, calculate leaf area (LA) for the whole set and at the individual leaf level, overlays important information on the images, and appends them on a compatible file used for CGMs with very high accuracy. The pipeline is dynamic and can be used for multiple crops. The use of open-source hardware, platforms, and algorithms makes this system affordable and reproducible.","[Potnuru, Chaitanyam; Donepudi, Leela Prasad] Corteva Agrisci, 12Th Floor, V Ascendas IT Pk, Hyderabad, Telangana, India; [Richardson, Grant A.

However, UWB researchers are currently limited by the small amount of feasible open source hardware that is publicly available. We developed a new open source hardware platform, Wi-PoS, for precise UWB localization based on Decawave's DW1000 UWB transceiver with several unique features: support of both long-range sub-GHz and 2.4 GHz back-end communication between nodes, flexible interfacing with external UWB antennas, and an easy implementation of the MAC layer with the Time-Annotated Instruction Set Computer (TAISC) framework. Both hardware and software are open source and all parameters of the UWB ranging can be adjusted, calibrated, and analyzed. This paper explains the main specifications of the hardware platform, illustrates design decisions, and evaluates the performance of the board in terms of range, accuracy, and energy consumption. The accuracy of the ranging system was below 10 cm in an indoor lab environment at distances up to 5 m, and accuracy smaller than 5 cm was obtained at 50 and 75 m in an outdoor environment. A theoretical model was derived for predicting the path loss and the influence of the most important ground reflection. At the same time, the average energy consumption of the hardware was very low with only 81 mA for a tag node and 63 mA for the active anchor nodes, permitting the system to run for several days on a mobile battery pack and allowing easy and fast deployment on sites without an accessible power supply or backbone network. The UWB hardware platform demonstrated flexibility, easy installation, and low power consumption.","[Van Herbruggen, Ben; Jooris, Bart; Rossey, Jen; Ridolfi, Matteo; Macoir, Nicola; Van den Brande, Quinten; Lemey, Sam; De Poorter, Eli] Univ Ghent, Dept Informat Technol, IMEC, IDLab, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium",Interuniversity Microelectronics Centre; Ghent University,"Van Herbruggen, B (corresponding author), Univ Ghent, Dept Informat Technol, IMEC, IDLab, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium.",Ben.vanherbruggen@ugent.be; Bart.jooris@ugent.be; Jen.rossey@ugent.be; Matteo.ridolfi@ugent.be; Nicola.macoir@ugent.be; Quinten.vandenbrande@ugent.be; Sam.lemey@ugent.be; Eli.depoorter@ugent.be,"Van Herbruggen, Ben/IQW-9577-2023; Ridolfi, Matteo/AAD-5937-2021; Lemey, Sam/U-1480-2019; De Poorter, Eli/JRX-1676-2023","Van Herbruggen, Ben/0000-0001-8900-4881; Ridolfi, Matteo/0000-0002-6857-2019; De Poorter, Eli/0000-0002-0214-5751; Van den Brande, Quinten/0000-0001-6323-6713; Macoir, Nicola/0000-0003-2066-1570; Lemey, Sam/0000-0003-1366-2604","projects: H2020 interreg Nano4Sport, VLAIO proeftuinproject SmartConnectivity","projects: H2020 interreg Nano4Sport, VLAIO proeftuinproject SmartConnectivity","This work has partially been funded by the following projects: H2020 interreg Nano4Sport, VLAIO proeftuinproject SmartConnectivity.",,28,39,39,1,6,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,1424-8220,,SENSORS-BASEL,Sensors,1-Apr,2019,19,7,,,,,,,1548,10.3390/s19071548,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/s19071548,,,16,"Chemistry, Analytical; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Instruments & Instrumentation",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Chemistry; Engineering; Instruments & Instrumentation,HU8WA,30935046,"Green Published, Green Submitted, gold",,,8/15/24,WOS:000465570700067,,0,137,,,

However, for the market segment of stand-alone, self-sustaining small IoT nodes, long-term deployment remains problematic due to the energy-constrained nature of these devices, requiring frequent maintenance. This article introduces Hypnos, an open hardware and software toolkit that aims to balance energy intake and usage through the adaptive sensing rate for low-cost Internet-connected IoT nodes. We describe the hardware architecture of the IoT node, an open hardware board based on the Arduino Uno form-factor packing the energy measurement circuitry, and the associated opensource software library, which interfaces with the sensing node's microcontroller and provides access to the low-level energy measurements. Hypnos comes equipped with a built-in, configurable, modified sigmoid function to regulate duty-cycle frequency based on energy intake and usage, yet developers may also plug in their custom duty/sleep balancing function. An experiment was set up, whereby two identical boards ran for two months: one with the Hypnos software framework and built-in energy-balancing function to regulate sensing rate and the other with fixed sensing rate. The experiment showed that Hypnos is able to successfully balance energy usage and sensing frequency within configurable energy ranges. Hereby, it increases the reliability by avoiding the complete shutdown, while, at the same time, optimizing performance in terms of the average amount of sensor measurements.","[Gonzalez-Perez, Alberto; Casteleyn, Sven] Univ Jaume 1, Inst New Imaging Technol, GEOTEC Res Grp, Castellon De La Plana 12071, Spain",Universitat Jaume I,"Gonzalez-Perez, A (corresponding author), Univ Jaume 1, Inst New Imaging Technol, GEOTEC Res Grp, Castellon De La Plana 12071, Spain.",alberto.gonzalez@uji.es; sven.casteleyn@uji.es,"Casteleyn, Sven/L-7187-2018","Casteleyn, Sven/0000-0003-0572-5716; Gonzalez-Perez, Alberto/0000-0002-9016-9357","Spanish Ministry of Education, Culture and Sports [FPU17/03832]; Ramon y Cajal Programme of the Spanish Government [RYC-2014-16606]","Spanish Ministry of Education, Culture and Sports(Spanish Government); Ramon y Cajal Programme of the Spanish Government(Spanish Government)","The work of Alberto Gonzalez-Perez was supported by the Spanish Ministry of Education, Culture and Sports under Grant FPU17/03832.

In contrast, the USV platform proposed in this paper is completely open-source, from hardware to software; most parts of the platform can be 3D-printed, and it can be easily modified and upgraded in terms of both design and programming. The platform is equipped with off-the-shelf water sensors for acquiring data like as pH, turbidity, and temperature to measure water quality in real water resources (such as ponds, reservoirs, and lakes). Furthermore, we provide an Android application through which users can easily control the USV via Bluetooth and display the sensor and GPS data the platform generates.

Fault rates increase in turn and become more concerning, particularly at the scale of High-Performance Computing (HPC) systems: on one hand, hardware fault protection is costly - more than 10% silicon area for floating-point units; on the other, HPC users expect correct application output after the anticipated time of computation, but workloads are seldom bit-reproducible and tolerances in output are allowed for. Benign hardware faults causing errors within these tolerances are therefore acceptable: however, with abstract reliability targets such as 'undetected failures per time,' current HPC system design does not allow for pursuing trade-offs between reliability and performance with respect to faults. To address the above, we propose a user-centric reliability benchmark to specify HPC system reliability targets, allowing for better performance optimizations in hardware design, while meeting HPC user expectations. Our open-source Hardware Design Fault Injection Toolkit (HDFIT) enables - for the first time - end-to-end hardware design reliability experiments: from netlist-level fault injection to application output error. In a proof of concept we present an HPC general matrix multiply (GEMM) reliability study, targeting a series of popular applications, and using HDFIT to benchmark an open-source GEMM accelerator.","[Omland, Patrik; Netti, Alessio; Peng, Yang; Baldovin, Andrea; Paulitsch, Michael; Espinosa, Gustavo; Parra, Jorge] Intel Corp, Santa Clara, CA 95054 USA; [Omland, Patrik; Hinz, Gereon; Knoll, Alois] Tech Univ Munich, Dept Informat, D-80333 Munich, Germany",Intel Corporation; Technical University of Munich,"Omland, P (corresponding author), Intel Corp, Santa Clara, CA 95054 USA.",patrik.omland@gmail.com; alessio.netti@intel.com; yang.r.peng@intel.com; andrea.baldovin@intel.com; michael.paulitsch@intel.com; gustavo.p.espinosa@intel.com; jorge.e.parra@intel.com; gereon.hinz@tum.de; knoll@in.tum.de,"Knoll, Alois/AAN-8417-2021","Knoll, Alois/0000-0003-4840-076X; Parra Osorio, Jorge Eduardo/0000-0003-1852-4286; Paulitsch, Michael/0000-0002-9241-5806; Omland, Patrik/0000-0003-1744-2852; Espinosa, Gustavo/0000-0003-0401-7355",,,,,40,3,3,0,1,IEEE COMPUTER SOC,LOS ALAMITOS,"10662 LOS VAQUEROS CIRCLE, PO BOX 3014, LOS ALAMITOS, CA 90720-1314 USA",1045-9219,1558-2183,,IEEE T PARALL DISTR,IEEE Trans.

HackRF is the hardware component, while GNU Radio will provide the graphical support to this device.

Given that advent of Internet of Things (IoT) era due to mobile technology progressions, the future needs a sorting method that is available on any environment, such as not only high performance systems like servers but also low computational performance machines like embedded systems. In this paper, we present an FPGA-based sorting accelerator combining Sorting Network and Merge Sorter Tree, which is customizable by means of tuning design parameters. The proposed FPGA accelerator sorts data sent from a host PC via the PCIe bus, and sends back the fully sorted data sequence to it. We also present a detailed analytical model that accurately estimates the sorting performance. Due to these characteristics, designers can know how fast a developed sorting hardware is in advance and can implement the best one to fulfill the cost and performance constraints. Our experiments show that the proposed hardware achieves up to 19.5x sorting performance, compared with Intel Core i7-3770K operating at 3.50GHz, when sorting 256M 32-bits integer elements. However, this result is limited because of insufficient memory bandwidth. To overcome this problem, we propose a data compression mechanism and the experimental result shows that the sorting hardware with it achieves almost 90% of the estimated performance, while the hardware without it does about 60%. In order to allow every designer to easily and freely use this accelerator, the RTL source code is released as open-source hardware.","[Kobayashi, Ryohei] Univ Tsukuba, Ctr Computat Sci, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3053577, Japan; [Kise, Kenji] Tokyo Inst Technol, Grad Sch Informat Sci & Engn, Tokyo 1528552, Japan",University of Tsukuba; Tokyo Institute of Technology,"Kobayashi, R (corresponding author), Univ Tsukuba, Ctr Computat Sci, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3053577, Japan.",kobayashi@cs.tsukuba.ac.jp; kise@cs.titech.ac.jp,"Kise, Kenji/B-9296-2015; Kobayashi, Ryohei/GVT-0939-2022","Kobayashi, Ryohei/0000-0003-2175-9828",,,,,24,4,4,0,1,IEICE-INST ELECTRONICS INFORMATION COMMUNICATION ENGINEERS,TOKYO,"KIKAI-SHINKO-KAIKAN BLDG, 3-5-8, SHIBA-KOEN, MINATO-KU, TOKYO, 105-0011, JAPAN",0916-8532,1745-1361,,IEICE T INF SYST,IEICE Trans.

Today, phasor measurement units (PMUs) are the ultimate tools for real-time monitoring of distribution grids' health, and they enable several data-driven added-value services such as fast and automated fault detection, isolation, and recovery; state estimation; power quality monitoring; dynamic events analysis, etc. The present paper proposes an open hardware and software PMU platform, which is low cost, high performance, expandable, and, in general, suitable for research and innovation activities.

Additionally, open-source hardware and field-programable gate arrays (FPGAs) are gaining traction via newly developed tools, frameworks, and HDLs. This enables new methods of creating hardware and systems faster, more simply, and more efficiently. In this paper, the implementation of a system-on-chip (SoC) based on a 32-bit RISC-V processor with lightweight cryptographic accelerator cores in FPGA and an open-source integrating framework is presented. The system consists of a 32-bit VexRiscv processor, written in SpinalHDL, and lightweight cryptographic accelerator cores for the PRINCE block cipher, the PRESENT-80 block cipher, the ChaCha stream cipher, and the SHA3-512 hash function, written in Verilog HDL and optimized for low latency with fewer clock cycles. The primary aim of this work was to develop a customized SoC platform with a register-controlled bus suitable for integrating lightweight cryptographic cores to become compact embedded systems that require encryption functionalities. Additionally, custom firmware was developed to verify the functionality of the SoC with all integrated accelerator cores, and to evaluate the speed of cryptographic processing. The proposed system was successfully implemented in a Xilinx Nexys4 DDR FPGA development board. The resources of the system in the FPGA were low with 11,830 LUTs and 9552 FFs.

Design: We performed a bench study. Setting: Dedicated research room as part of an ICU affiliated to a university hospital. Subjects: We set the lung model with three conditions of resistance and linear compliance for mimicking different respiratory mechanics of representative intensive care unit (ICU) patients. Interventions: The performance of the device was tested using the ASL5000 lung model. Measurements and Main Results: Twenty-seven conditions were tested. All the measurements fell within the +/- 10% limits for the tidal volume (V-T). The volume error was influenced by the mechanical condition (p = 5.9 x 10(-15)) and the PEEP level (P = 1.1 x 10(-12)) but the clinical significance of this finding is likely meaningless (maximum -34 mL in the error). The PEEP error was not influenced by the mechanical condition (p = 0.25). Our experimental results demonstrate that the eSpiro ventilator is reliable to deliver V-T and PEEP accurately in various respiratory mechanics conditions. Conclusions: We report a low-cost, easy-to-build ventilator, which is reliable to deliver V-T and PEEP in passive invasive mechanical ventilation.","[Terzi, Nicolas] Univ Grenoble Alpes, INSERM, U1042, HP2, F-38000 Grenoble, France; [Terzi, Nicolas; Roux, Marion; Sigaud, Florian; Rigault, Guillaume] CHU Grenoble Alpes, Med Intens Reanimat, F-38000 Grenoble, France; [Rastello, Fabrice] Univ Grenoble Alpes, INRIA, Grenoble INP, LIG,CNRS, F-38000 Grenoble, France; [Dehan, Christophe] MinMaxMed SAS, 75 v Gabriel Peri, F-38400 St Martin Dheres, France; [Fromentin, Cyril] FineHeart SAS, Coeur Bersol 28 Ave Gustave Eiffel,Batiment C, F-33600 Pessac, France; [Farrugia, Adrien] SteadXP SAS, F-38000 Grenoble, France; [Guerin, Claude] Hosp Civils Lyon, Hop Edouard Herriot, Grp Hosp Ctr, Med Intens Reanimat, F-69366 Lyon, France; [Guerin, Claude] Univ Lyon, F-69366 Lyon, France; [Guerin, Claude] CNRS, Inst Mondor Rech Biomed, Inserm 955, CNRS,ERL 7000, F-94010 Creteil, France",Institut National de la Sante et de la Recherche Medicale (Inserm); Communaute Universite Grenoble Alpes; Universite Grenoble Alpes (UGA); CHU Grenoble Alpes; Communaute Universite Grenoble Alpes; Institut National Polytechnique de Grenoble; Universite Grenoble Alpes (UGA); Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Inria; CHU Lyon; Universite Gustave-Eiffel; Institut National de la Sante et de la Recherche Medicale (Inserm); Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Universite Paris-Est-Creteil-Val-de-Marne (UPEC),"Terzi, N (corresponding author), Univ Grenoble Alpes, INSERM, U1042, HP2, F-38000 Grenoble, France.; Terzi, N (corresponding author), CHU Grenoble Alpes, Med Intens Reanimat, F-38000 Grenoble, France.",nterzi@chu-grenoble.fr; frastell@gmail.com; christophe.dehan@minmaxmedical.com; MRoux3@chu-grenoble.fr; FSigaud@chu-grenoble.fr; grigault@chu-grenoble.fr; cyril.fromentin@fine-heart.com; adrienfarrugia@yahoo.fr; claude.guerin@chu-lyon.fr,"GUERIN, CLAUDE/IAP-4956-2023; TERZI, Nicolas/AAD-4348-2019","TERZI, Nicolas/0000-0003-4036-6245; Roux, Marion/0009-0004-5913-860X; GUERIN, Claude/0000-0003-4700-6672; Sigaud, Florian/0000-0001-6399-5867",,,,,17,1,1,0,5,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2077-0383,,J CLIN MED,J.

Consequently, the risk of blades breakage by hitting the tower has increased. In order to prevent such incidents, this study proposes a deflection monitoring system that can be installed to already operating wind turbine's blades. The monitoring system is composed of an estimation algorithm to detect blade deflection and a wireless sensor network as a hardware equipment. As for the estimation method for blade deflection, a strain-based estimation algorithm and an objective function for optimal sensor arrangement are proposed. Strain-based estimation algorithm is using a linear correlation between strain and deflections, which can be expressed in a form of a transformation matrix. The objective function includes the terms of strain sensitivity and condition number of the transformation matrix between strain and deflection. In order to calculate the objective function, a simplified experimental model of the blade is constructed by interpolating the mode shape of a blade from modal testing. The interpolation method is effective considering a practical use to operating wind turbines' blades since it is not necessary to establish a finite element model of a blade. On the other hand, a sensor network with wireless connection with an open source hardware is developed. It is installed to a 300 W scale wind turbine and vibration of the blade on operation is investigated. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Nevertheless, model parameters are usually estimated on the basis of guidelines from user manuals and literature because they are not usually monitored, due to the high cost of conventional monitoring systems. Within this framework, a new and promising generation of low-cost sensors for hydrologic monitoring, logging, and transition has been developed. We aimed to design a low-cost, open-hardware platform, based on a Raspberry Pi and software written in Python 3, for measuring, recording, and wireless data transmission in hydrological monitoring contexts. Moreover, the data are linked to a runoff model, in real time, for flood prevention. Complementarily, it emphasizes the role of the calibration and validation of soil moisture, rain gauges, and water depth sensors in laboratories. It was installed in a small mountain basin. The results showed mean absolute errors of +/- 2.2% in soil moisture, +/- 1 mm in rainfall, and +/- 0.51 cm in water depth measurements; they highlight the potential of this platform for hydrological monitoring and flood risk management.","[Segovia-Cardozo, Daniel A.; Rodriguez-Sinobas, Leonor; Canales-Ide, Freddy; Zubelzu, Sergio] Univ Politecn Madrid, Dept Ingn Agroforestal ETSI Agron Alimentaria & B, Res Grp Hydraul Irrigat, Ciudad Univ S-N, Madrid 28040, Spain",Universidad Politecnica de Madrid,"Segovia-Cardozo, DA (corresponding author), Univ Politecn Madrid, Dept Ingn Agroforestal ETSI Agron Alimentaria & B, Res Grp Hydraul Irrigat, Ciudad Univ S-N, Madrid 28040, Spain.",da.segovia@upm.es; leonor.rodriguez.sinobas@upm.es; freddy.canales.ide@alumnos.upm.es; sergio.zubelzu@upm.es,"Segovia-Cardozo, Daniel A./AAR-2503-2020","Segovia-Cardozo, Daniel A./0000-0002-4110-1823; Canales-Ide, Freddy/0000-0001-9348-6297",Spanish Centro para el Desarrollo Tecnologico Industrial (CDTI) [PCD1820280276]; European Union [CGL2017-83546-C3-3-R],Spanish Centro para el Desarrollo Tecnologico Industrial (CDTI); European Union(European Union (EU)),"This work was supported by the Spanish Centro para el Desarrollo Tecnologico Industrial (CDTI) [grant PCD1820280276] (SMART-HYDRO project) and the European Union (AEI/FEDER, UE) [grant DRAINAGE CGL2017-83546-C3-3-R].",,52,4,4,4,12,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2073-4441,,WATER-SUI,Water,NOV,2021,13,21,,,,,,,3099,10.3390/w13213099,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w13213099,,,19,Environmental Sciences; Water Resources,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Water Resources,WX5DL,,gold,,,8/15/24,WOS:000718616400001,,0,153,,,

The first solution is the use of a traditional CAM software (FreeCad) for machining programming through the development of a dedicated post -processor. The second is an automatic layer -by -layer hybridization enabled by the software ""SuperSlicer"". This method requires no machining knowledge but only allows contouring operations. Results of experiments show that the spindle presented in this work is capable of successfully carrying out a hybrid process that significantly improves the surface roughness parameters, with an improvement factor of 10 for most parameters. An uniformization of surface roughness parameters was also observed in the construction direction and in the deposition/machining direction. The layer -by -layer hybridization yields the better results in terms of surface roughness. This is because the reduced depth of cut (equivalent to a printed layer) minimizes stress and temperature rise, resulting in highly favorable cutting conditions.","[Martinez, Luis Vincent Tejada; Witz, Jean-Francois] CNRS UMR 9013 LaMcube Lab Mecan Multiphys Multiech, Lille, France; Cent Lille, Cite Sci, F-59650 Villeneuve Dascq, France; Polytech Lille, Av Paul Langevin, F-59655 Villeneuve Dascq, France",Universite de Lille; Centrale Lille; Universite de Lille,"Martinez, LVT; Witz, JF (corresponding author), CNRS UMR 9013 LaMcube Lab Mecan Multiphys Multiech, Lille, France.",luis.tejada@univ-lille.fr; jean-francois.witz@centralelille.fr,,"Lesaffre, Francois/0009-0000-6994-1261",Haut de France region; European Regional Development Fund; The 3D printer manufacturer Dagoma; INTERREG Fance-Wallonie-Vlaanderen program,Haut de France region; European Regional Development Fund(European Union (EU)); The 3D printer manufacturer Dagoma; INTERREG Fance-Wallonie-Vlaanderen program,"The first part of this article was produced as part of the Fabricar3v project www.fabricar3v.eu.

The sample holder is made in such a way that samples can easily be mounted on it by two movable latches.

Finally, the mechatronic system is tested for the intended application using a halogen light source and a spectrometer to measure transmission through glass TCO samples through a hemisphere. The system performed as expected has a unidirectional accuracy of 2.827 degrees, repeatability of 1.585 degrees, backlash error of 1.237 degrees, maximum speed of 35.156 degrees and a verifiable microstep size of 0.33 degrees. Despite the highest mean squared errors, the open source gimbal system performed adequately while measuring transmission of radiation through glass with TCO coatings. This open source system also represents a 96% cost in savings as compared to the least expensive commercial variant. The high mean squared errors are offset by the cost of the system coupled with its open source nature that promotes further collaboration and hence, development.","[Bihari, Nupur; Pearce, Joshua M.] Michigan Technol Univ, Dept Mat Sci & Engn, 601 M&M Bldg, Houghton, MI 49931 USA; [Dash, Smruti Prasad; Pearce, Joshua M.] Michigan Technol Univ, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, Houghton, MI 49931 USA; [Dhankani, Karankumar C.] Michigan Technol Univ, Dept Mech Engn Engn Mech, Houghton, MI 49931 USA; [Pearce, Joshua M.] Aalto Univ, Sch Elect Engn, Dept Elect & Nanoengn, FI-02150 Espoo, Finland",Michigan Technological University; Michigan Technological University; Michigan Technological University; Aalto University,"Pearce, JM (corresponding author), Michigan Technol Univ, Dept Mat Sci & Engn, 601 M&M Bldg, Houghton, MI 49931 USA.",pearce@mtu.edu,"Pearce, Joshua/D-2052-2010","Pearce, Joshua/0000-0001-9802-3056",MOST lab; Fulbright Finland,MOST lab; Fulbright Finland,This work was supported by the MOST lab and Fulbright Finland.,,94,4,4,0,28,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",0957-4158,,,MECHATRONICS,Mechatronics,DEC,2018,56,,,,,,175,187,,10.1016/j.mechatronics.2018.07.005,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.mechatronics.2018.07.005,,,13,"Automation & Control Systems; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Engineering, Mechanical; Robotics",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Automation & Control Systems; Engineering; Robotics,HF6XT,,Green Submitted,,,8/15/24,WOS:000454382300016,,0,156,,,

Whereas these robotic sailboats have good performance with open-source designs, it is actually hard for interested researchers or fans to follow and make their own sailboats with these open-source designs. Thus, in this paper, a generic and flexible unmanned sailboat platform with easy access to the hardware and software architectures is designed and tested. The commonly used 1-m class RC racing sailboat was employed to install Pixhawk V2.4.8, Arduino Mega 2,560, GPS module M8N, custom-designed wind direction sensor, and wireless 433 Mhz telegram. The widely used open-source hardware modules were selected to keep reliable and low-cost hardware setup to emphasize the generality and feasibility of the unmanned sailboat platform. In software architecture, the Pixhawk V2.4.8 provided reliable states' feedback. The Arduino Mega 2,560 received estimated states from Pixhawk V2.4.8 and the wind vane sensor, and then controlled servo actuators of rudder and sail using simplified algorithms. Due to the complexity of introducing robot operating system and its packages, we designed a generic but real-time software architecture just using Arduino Mega 2,560. A suitable line-of-sight guidance strategy and PID-based controllers were used to let the autonomous sailboat sail at user-defined waypoints. Field tests validated the sailing performance in facing WRSC challenges. Results of fleet race, station keeping, and area scanning proved that our design and algorithms could control the 1-m class RC sailboat with acceptable accuracy. The proposed design and algorithms contributed to developing educational, low-cost, micro class autonomous sailboats with accessible, generic, and flexible hardware and software. Besides, our sailboat platform also facilitates readers to develop similar sailboats with more focus on their missions.","[Yang, Shaolong; Liu, Chuan; Liu, Ya; An, Jinxin; Xiang, Xianbo] Huazhong Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Naval Architecture & Ocean Engn, Wuhan, Peoples R China; [Yang, Shaolong; Xiang, Xianbo] Huazhong Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Naval Architecture & Ocean Engn, Hubei Key Lab Naval Architecture & Ocean Engn Hyd, Wuhan, Peoples R China",Huazhong University of Science & Technology; Huazhong University of Science & Technology,"Xiang, XB (corresponding author), Huazhong Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Naval Architecture & Ocean Engn, Wuhan, Peoples R China.; Xiang, XB (corresponding author), Huazhong Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Naval Architecture & Ocean Engn, Hubei Key Lab Naval Architecture & Ocean Engn Hyd, Wuhan, Peoples R China.",xbxiang@hust.edu.cn,"Xiang, Xianbo/O-7613-2019","Xiang, Xianbo/0000-0002-6215-9864; Liu, Chuan/0000-0002-4048-1764","National Natural Science Foundation of China [52071153]; Industry-University Cooperative Education Project of Ministry of Education, China [201902044047]; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities, China [2018KFYYXJJ015]; School of Naval Architecture and Ocean Engineering, HUST; Experimental Technology Research Project - Lab and equipment administration department, HUST","National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Industry-University Cooperative Education Project of Ministry of Education, China; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities, China(Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities); School of Naval Architecture and Ocean Engineering, HUST; Experimental Technology Research Project - Lab and equipment administration department, HUST","This work is partially supported by National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant 52071153; Industry-University Cooperative Education Project of Ministry of Education, China under Grant 201902044047; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities, China under Grant 2018KFYYXJJ015; Teaching Research Project Funded by the School of Naval Architecture and Ocean Engineering, HUST; Experimental Technology Research Project Funded by the Lab and equipment administration department, HUST.",,23,2,2,2,32,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,LAUSANNE,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",2296-9144,,,FRONT ROBOT AI,Front.

In this paper, we introduce an innovative turbidity sensor, and it is the first low-cost turbidity sensor that is designed specifically for long-term stormwater in-field monitoring. Its low cost (USD 23.50) enables the implementation of high spatial resolution monitoring schemes. The sensor design is available under open hardware and open-source licences, and the 3D-printed sensor housing is free to modify based on different monitoring purposes and ambient conditions. The sensor was tested both in the laboratory and in the field. By testing the sensor in the lab with standard turbidity solutions, the proposed low-cost turbidity sensor demonstrated a strong linear correlation between a low-cost sensor and a commercial hand-held turbidimeter. In the field, the low-cost sensor measurements were statistically significantly correlated to a standard high-cost commercial turbidity sensor. Biofouling and drifting issues were also analysed after the sensors were deployed in the field for more than 6 months, showing that both biofouling and drift occur during monitoring. Nonetheless, in terms of maintenance requirements, the low-cost sensor exhibited similar needs compared to the GreenSpan sensor.","[Wang, Miao; Shi, Baiqian; Catsamas, Stephen; Kolotelo, Peter] Monash Univ, Dept Civil Engn, Wellington Rd, Melbourne 3800, Australia; [McCarthy, David] Queensland Univ Technol, Sch Civil & Environm Engn, S Block,Level 7,S727, Brisbane 4000, Australia",Monash University; Queensland University of Technology (QUT),"McCarthy, D (corresponding author), Queensland Univ Technol, Sch Civil & Environm Engn, S Block,Level 7,S727, Brisbane 4000, Australia.",miao.wang@monash.edu; baiqian.shi@monash.edu; stephen.catsamas@monash.edu; peter.kolotelo@monash.edu; david.mccarthy@qut.edu.au,,,,,,,70,0,0,5,5,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,1424-8220,,SENSORS-BASEL,Sensors,JUN,2024,24,12,,,,,,,3926,10.3390/s24123926,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/s24123926,,,23,"Chemistry, Analytical; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Instruments & Instrumentation",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Chemistry; Engineering; Instruments & Instrumentation,WQ2G7,38931710,gold,,,8/15/24,WOS:001256267400001,,0,159,,,

The device developed in this work is the cup anemometer, that is easy to build. The great advantage of this device is the low cost, with an approximate value of US$ 50.00, using simple materials that are easy to find in commercial stores. The Reed Switch sensor is also another advantage as it does not require a sophisticated programming, as well as the open platform Arduino. The use of theoretical aerodynamic drag coefficients and the presented calculations resulted in values very close to a commercial anemometer. The coefficient of determination between the cup Anemometer and the standard sensor of Meteorological Research Institute IPMet/Brazil is R-2=0.9999, indicating strong correlation between the instruments. As the reference anemometer (IPMet) has high embedded technology and the prototype is low cost, we conclude that the project has an attractive cost benefit for possible development and production, reaching the objective of this work.","[Avallone, Elson; Mioralli, Paulo Cesar; Gomes Natividade, Pablo Sampaio; Palota, Paulo Henrique; da Costa, Jose Ferreira; Antonio, Jonas Rafael; Verderio Junior, Silvio Aparecido] Fed Inst Educ Sci & Technol Sao Paulo, Catanduva, SP, Brazil",Instituto Federal de Sao Paulo (IFSP),"Avallone, E (corresponding author), Fed Inst Educ Sci & Technol Sao Paulo, Catanduva, SP, Brazil.",elson.avallone@ifsp.edu.br,"Avallone, Elson/W-9532-2018; Verd√©rio J√∫nior, S√≠lvio Aparecido/AGV-4452-2022; Mioralli, Paulo Cesar/N-6907-2014","Avallone, Elson/0000-0001-9650-9239; Verd√©rio J√∫nior, S√≠lvio Aparecido/0000-0001-9695-7197; Mioralli, Paulo Cesar/0000-0001-8611-4356",,,,,30,1,1,3,17,UNIV NIS,NIS,"UNIVERZITETSKI TRG 2, PO BOX 123, NIS, 18000, SERBIA",0353-3670,2217-5997,,FACTA UNIV-SER ELECT,Facta Univ.-Ser.

Acquiring gameplay in a scanner remains challenging due to the lack of a scanner-compatible videogame controller that provides a similar experience to standard, commercial devices. In this paper, we introduce a videogame controller designed for use in the functional magnetic resonance imaging as well as magnetoencephalography. The controller is made exclusively of 3D-printed and commercially available parts. We evaluated the quality of our controller by comparing it to a non-MRI compatible controller that was kept outside the scanner. The comparison of response latencies showed reliable button press accuracies of adequate precision. Comparison of the subjects' motion during fMRI recordings of various tasks showed that the use of our controller did not increase the amount of motion produced compared to a regular MR compatible button press box. Motion levels during an ecological videogame task were of moderate amplitude. In addition, we found that the controller only had marginal effect on temporal SNR in fMRI, as well as on covariance between sensors in MEG, as expected due to the use of non-magnetic building materials. Finally, the reproducibility of the controller was demonstrated by having team members who were not involved in the design build a reproduction using only the documentation. This new videogame controller opens new avenues for ecological tasks in fMRI, including challenging videogames and more generally tasks with complex responses. The detailed controller documentation and build instructions are released under an Open Source Hardware license to increase accessibility, and reproducibility and enable the neuroimaging research community to improve or modify the controller for future experiments.","[Harel, Yann; Cyr, Andre; Boyle, Julie; Pinsard, Basile; Bellec, Pierre] Inst Univ Geriatr Montreal, Ctr Rech, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [Harel, Yann; Boyle, Julie; Jerbi, Karim; Bellec, Pierre] Univ Montreal, Psychol Dept, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [Cyr, Andre; Boyle, Julie; Pinsard, Basile; Jerbi, Karim; Bellec, Pierre] Inst Univ Geriatr Montreal, Ctr Rech, Unite Neuroimagerie Fonct, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [Bernard, Jeremy; Fourcade, Marie-France] CEA, Neurospin, Gif Sur Yvette, France; [Aggarwal, Himanshu; Ponce, Ana Fernanda; Thirion, Bertrand] Univ Paris Saclay, Inria, CEA, Palaiseau, France; [Jerbi, Karim] MILA, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [Jerbi, Karim] Univ Montreal, MEG Imaging Ctr, Montreal, PQ, Canada",Universite de Montreal; Universite de Montreal; Universite de Montreal; CEA; Universite Paris Saclay; Universite Paris Cite; CEA; Inria; Universite de Montreal,"Harel, Y (corresponding author), Inst Univ Geriatr Montreal, Ctr Rech, Montreal, PQ, Canada.; Harel, Y (corresponding author), Univ Montreal, Psychol Dept, Montreal, PQ, Canada.",yann.harel@umontreal.ca,,"Thirion, Bertrand/0000-0001-5018-7895","The authors would like to thank the MEG Imaging Center, the Functional Neuroimaging Unit at CRIUGM and the Courtois NeuroMod scanning crews for acquiring the data.","The authors would like to thank the MEG Imaging Center, the Functional Neuroimaging Unit at CRIUGM and the Courtois NeuroMod scanning crews for acquiring the data.","The authors would like to thank the MEG Imaging Center, the Functional Neuroimaging Unit at CRIUGM and the Courtois NeuroMod scanning crews for acquiring the data.",,33,0,0,1,2,PUBLIC LIBRARY SCIENCE,SAN FRANCISCO,"1160 BATTERY STREET, STE 100, SAN FRANCISCO, CA 94111 USA",1932-6203,,,PLOS ONE,PLoS One,1-Nov,2023,18,11,,,,,,,e0290158,10.1371/journal.pone.0290158,http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0290158,,,21,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Science & Technology - Other Topics,X8YI8,37910557,"gold, Green Published",,,8/15/24,WOS:001101239700022,,0,161,,,

To obtain the reference signals for the NARX and determine the 65 W PV module behavior, a system made of a 0.8 W PV cell, a temperature sensor, a voltage sensor and a static neural network, was used. To evaluate performance a comparison with the P&O traditional algorithm was done in terms of response time and oscillations around the operating point. Simulation results demonstrated the superiority of neural controller over the P&O.

It is designed, built, and tested for its ability to convert post-consumer waste, 3D printed products and waste into polymer feedstock for recyclebots of fused particle/granule printers. The technical specifications of the device are quantified in terms of power consumption (380 to 404 W for PET and PLA, respectively) and particle size distribution. The open source device can be fabricated for less than $2000 USD in materials. The experimentally measured power use is only a minor contribution to the overall embodied energy of distributed recycling of waste plastic.

These results indicate that the open source waste plastic granulator is an appropriate technology for community, library, maker space, fab lab, or small business-based distributed recycling.","[Ravindran, Arvind; Scsavnicki, Sean; Nelson, Walker; Gorecki, Peter; Franz, Jacob; Barnard, Andrew R.] Michigan Technol Univ, Dept Mech Engn Engn Mech, Houghton, MI 49931 USA; [Oberloier, Shane; Pearce, Joshua M.] Michigan Technol Univ, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, Houghton, MI 49931 USA; [Meyer, Theresa K.; Pearce, Joshua M.] Michigan Technol Univ, Dept Mat Sci & Engn, Houghton, MI 49931 USA; [Pearce, Joshua M.] Aalto Univ, Sch Elect Engn, Dept Elect & Nanoengn, FI-00076 Espoo, Finland",Michigan Technological University; Michigan Technological University; Michigan Technological University; Aalto University,"Pearce, JM (corresponding author), Michigan Technol Univ, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, Houghton, MI 49931 USA.; Pearce, JM (corresponding author), Michigan Technol Univ, Dept Mat Sci & Engn, Houghton, MI 49931 USA.; Pearce, JM (corresponding author), Aalto Univ, Sch Elect Engn, Dept Elect & Nanoengn, FI-00076 Espoo, Finland.",arvindr@mtu.edu; ssscsavn@mtu.edu; wnelson@mtu.edu; pjgoreck@mtu.edu; jafranz@mtu.edu; swoberlo@mtu.edu; tkmeyer@mtu.edu; arbarnar@mtu.edu; pearce@mtu.edu,"Meyer, Theresa/IUM-2713-2023; Pearce, Joshua/C-9240-2013","Oberloier, Shane/0000-0002-2727-9713; Barnard, Andrew/0000-0003-3276-8113; Pearce, Joshua/0000-0001-9802-3056",Witte Endowment,Witte Endowment,This research was funded by the Witte Endowment.,,70,11,11,2,18,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2227-7080,,TECHNOLOGIES,Technologies,DEC,2019,7,4,,,,,,,74,10.3390/technologies7040074,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/technologies7040074,,,21,"Engineering, Multidisciplinary",Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI),Engineering,KB7HV,,gold,,,8/15/24,WOS:000506662500007,,0,164,,,

The complexity involved in researching and building soft robots often stems from the interconnectedness of design and control aspects, which are rarely addressed together as a unified problem. To address such complex interdependencies in soft robotics, the Sorotoki toolkit provides a comprehensive and modular programming environment composed of seven Object-Oriented classes. These classes are designed to work together to solve a wide range of soft robotic problems, offering versatility and flexibility for its users. We provide here a comprehensive overview of the Sorotoki software architecture to highlight its usage and applications. The details and interconnections of each module are thoroughly described, collectively explaining how to gradually introduce modeling complexity for various soft robotic scenarios. The effectiveness of Sorotoki is also demonstrated through a range of case studies, including novel problem scenarios and established works widely recognized in the soft robotics community. These case studies cover a broad range of research problems, including: inverse design of soft actuators, passive and active soft locomotion, object manipulation with soft grippers, meta-materials, model reduction, model-based control of soft robots, and online shape estimation. Additionally, the toolkit provides access to four open-hardware soft robotic systems that can be fabricated using commercially available 3D printers.

Advances in open hardware platforms and off-the-shelf photoplethysmogram (PPG) sensors allow the non-intrusive collection of heart rate data at very low cost. However, the signal is not trivial to analyse, since the morphology of PPG waveforms differs from electrocardiogram (ECG) waveforms and shows different noise patterns. Few validated open source available algorithms exist that handle PPG data well, as most of these algorithms are specifically designed for ECG data. In this paper we present the validation of a novel algorithm named HeartPy, useful for the analysis of heart rate data collected in noisy settings, such as when driving a car or when in a simulator. We benchmark the performance on two types of datasets and show that the developed algorithm performs well. Further research steps are discussed. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Based on the design of the Kilobot and compatible with existing hardware, the Kilogrid is a modular system composed of a grid of computing nodes, or modules that provides a bidirectional communication channel between the Kilobots and a remote workstation. In this paper, we describe the hardware and software architecture of the Kilogrid system as well as its functioning to accompany its release as a new open hardware tool for the swarm robotics community. We demonstrate the capabilities of the Kilogrid using a 200-module Kilogrid, swarms of up to 100 Kilobots, and four different case studies: exploration and obstacle avoidance, site selection based on multiple gradients, plant watering, and pheromone-based foraging.

However, it has proved challenging to 3D print PDMS in complex structures due to its low elastic modulus and need for support during the printing process. Here we demonstrate the 3D printing of hydrophobic PDMS prepolymer resins within a hydrophilic Carbopol gel support via freeform reversible embedding (FRE). In the FRE printing process, the Carbopol support acts as a Bingham plastic that yields and fluidizes when the syringe tip of the 3D printer moves through it, but acts as a solid for the PDMS extruded within it. This, in combination with the immiscibility of hydrophobic PDMS in the hydrophilic Carbopol, confines the PDMS prepolymer within the support for curing times up to 72 h while maintaining dimensional stability. After printing and curing, the Carbopol support gel releases the embedded PDMS prints by using phosphate buffered saline solution to reduce the Carbopol yield stress. As proof-of-concept, we used Sylgard 184 PDMS to 3D print linear and helical filaments via continuous extrusion and cylindrical and helical tubes via layer-by-layer fabrication. Importantly, we show that the 3D printed tubes were manifold and perfusable. The results demonstrate that hydrophobic polymers with low viscosity and long cure times can be 3D printed using a hydrophilic support, expanding the range of biomaterials that can be used in additive manufacturing. Further, by implementing the technology using low cost open-source hardware and software tools, the FRE printing technique can be rapidly implemented for research applications.","[Hinton, Thomas J.; Hudson, Andrew; Lee, Andrew; Feinberg, Adam W.] Carnegie Mellon Univ, Dept Biomed Engn, 5000 Forbes Ave, Pittsburgh, PA 15213 USA; [Pusch, Kira; Feinberg, Adam W.] Carnegie Mellon Univ, Dept Mat Sci & Engn, 5000 Forbes Ave, Pittsburgh, PA 15213 USA",Carnegie Mellon University; Carnegie Mellon University,"Feinberg, AW (corresponding author), Carnegie Mellon Univ, Dept Biomed Engn, 5000 Forbes Ave, Pittsburgh, PA 15213 USA.; Feinberg, AW (corresponding author), Carnegie Mellon Univ, Dept Mat Sci & Engn, 5000 Forbes Ave, Pittsburgh, PA 15213 USA.",feinberg@andrew.cmu.edu,"Feinberg, Adam/A-7103-2009; Hudson, Andrew/ABC-1122-2021","Feinberg, Adam/0000-0003-3338-5456; Lee, Andrew/0000-0001-5174-4999","National Institutes of Health Director's New Innovator Award [DP2HL117750]; Disruptive Health Technology Institute, Carnegie Mellon University [A017261-HIGHMARK-Feinberg]; National Science Foundation CAREER Award [1454248]; Directorate For Engineering; Div Of Civil, Mechanical, & Manufact Inn [1454248] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","National Institutes of Health Director's New Innovator Award(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA); Disruptive Health Technology Institute, Carnegie Mellon University; National Science Foundation CAREER Award(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Directorate For Engineering; Div Of Civil, Mechanical, & Manufact Inn(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Engineering (ENG))","We thank Dr. Rachelle Palchesko Simko for technical assistance with uniaxial tensile testing.

Closed-loop experiments, in which causal interventions are conditioned on the state of the system under investigation, have become increasingly common in neuroscience. Such experiments can have a high degree of explanatory power, but they require a precise implementation that can be difficult to replicate across laboratories. We sought to overcome this limitation by building open-source software that makes it easier to develop and share algorithms for closed-loop control. Approach. We created the Open Ephys GUI, an opensource platform for multichannel electrophysiology experiments. In addition to the standard 'open-loop' visualization and recording functionality, the GUI also includes modules for delivering feedback in response to events detected in the incoming data stream. Importantly, these modules can be built and shared as plugins, which makes it possible for users to extend the functionality of the GUI through a simple API, without having to understand the inner workings of the entire application. Main results. In combination with low-cost, open-source hardware for amplifying and digitizing neural signals, the GUI has been used for closedloop experiments that perturb the hippocampal theta rhythm in a phase-specific manner. Significance. The Open Ephys GUI is the first widely used application for multichannel electrophysiology that leverages a plugin-based workflow. We hope that it will lower the barrier to entry for electrophysiologists who wish to incorporate real-time feedback into their research.","[Siegle, Joshua H.] Allen Inst Brain Sci, 615 Westlake Ave N, Seattle, WA 98109 USA; [Lopez, Aaron Cuevas] Univ Politecn Valencia, Cami Vera S-N, E-46022 Valencia, Spain; [Patel, Yogi A.] Georgia Inst Technol, North Ave NW, Atlanta, GA 30332 USA; [Abramov, Kirill] Zaporizhzhya State Engn Acad, Sobornyi Ave 226, UA-69006 Zaporizhia, Zaporizka Oblas, Ukraine; [Ohayon, Shay; Voigts, Jakob] MIT, 77 Massachusetts Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Lopez, Aaron Cuevas] Inst Neurociencias CSIC UMH, Ave Santiago Ramon y Cajal S-N, Alicante 03550, Spain",Allen Institute for Brain Science; Universitat Politecnica de Valencia; University System of Georgia; Georgia Institute of Technology; Ministry of Education & Science of Ukraine; Zaporizhzhia National University; Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT); Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas (CSIC); Universidad Miguel Hernandez de Elche; CSIC-UMH - Instituto de Neurociencias de Alicante (IN),"Siegle, JH (corresponding author), Allen Inst Brain Sci, 615 Westlake Ave N, Seattle, WA 98109 USA.",joshs@alleninstitute.org,,"Cuevas Lopez, Aaron/0000-0002-1228-5045",,,,,31,249,293,2,17,IOP PUBLISHING LTD,BRISTOL,"TEMPLE CIRCUS, TEMPLE WAY, BRISTOL BS1 6BE, ENGLAND",1741-2560,1741-2552,,J NEURAL ENG,J.

The experiments presented here show the reliability of the open hardware and software embedded onboard the quadrotor. To estimate the robot s attitude, a quaternion-based complementary filter requiring very few computational resources was developed and implemented on an 8-bit Arduino board. It was also established that the stabilization feedback system based on quaternions tracks the attitude setpoints with precision up to twice greater than a classical cascaded PI controller. The controllers and estimators were designed in the Matlab/Simulink environment and directly implemented onboard the tiny Linux-based autopilot board using a custom made toolbox (RT-MaG toolbox). The autopilot was tested in the brand-new Marseilles Flying Arena with various 3-D flight trajectories and found to be highly accurate with errors of only 0.7cm in hover and less than 3.2cm at 1.2m.s(-1).

In this paper, collected by a motorized telescope mount was data analyzed using both video observations by trained observers and modernized approaches using computer vision. The more advanced data extraction used the OpenCV library of computer vision tools to identify bird silhouettes by means of image stabilization and background subtraction. The silhouettes were sanitized and analyzed in sequence to produce stacked relationships between temporally close contours, discriminating birds from noise based on the assumption that birds migrate in stable paths. The flight ceiling of the birds was determined by extracting relevant correlation coefficient data from doppler radar co-located with the LunAero instrument in Norman, OK, USA using a method with low-computational overhead. The bird paths and flight ceiling were combined with lunar ephemera to provide input for the original method used for nocturnal migration quantification as well as an enhanced version of the same method with more advanced computational tools. We found that the manual quantification of migration activity detected 16,300 birds/km center dot h heading northwest from 110 degrees, whereas the automated analysis reported a density of 43,794 birds/km center dot h heading northwest from 106.67 degrees. Hence, there was agreement with regard to flight direction, but the automated method overestimated migration density by approximately three times. The reasons for the discrepancy between flight path detection appeared to be due to a substantial amount of noise in the video data as well as a tendency for the computer vision analysis to split single flight paths into two or more segments.

Retrieving these data and storing them can be challenging. Present options include proprietary commercial dataloggers, communication devices, and protocols with rigid software and data structures that may require ongoing expenses. While there are open-source solutions that include telemetry, such as EnviroDIY's Mayfly, none presently generate real-time, remotely accessible workbooks (Aufdenkampe et al., 2017; EnviroDIY, 2018). The Openly Published Environmental Sensing (OPEnS) Lab developed the OPEnS Hub, a new approach to using low-power, open-source hardware and software to achieve real-time data logging from the field to the web. The Hub is an order of magnitude less expensive than commercial products, inherently modular and flexible, and aims to reduce technical barriers for users with little programming experience (DeBell, 2019). Data can be collected remotely using a host of transmission protocols to relay data from distributed in situ monitoring devices. The Hub mesh-networks with several nodes and backs up to an onboard microSD card. Telemetry options include 900 MHz Long Range Radio (LoRa) with up to 25 km range and Nordic Radio Frequency (nRF) for higher data rates (Feather, 2018). Ongoing transmissions from the Hub to the internet currently employ Ethernet with potential support for Wi-Fi and the cell network. The Hub engages a dynamic, low-latency portal to Google Sheets via the free Application Programming Interface (API), PushingBox, and an adaptable Google Apps Script. This framework was tested on 12 individual sensors nodes at remote sites in Oregon. This manuscript details our methods and evaluates PushingBox, Google Apps Script, Adafruit Industries' open-hardware Feather development boards, the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP), and the aforementioned modes of data transfer.","[DeBell, Thomas; Larson, Lars; Selker, John; Udell, Chet] Oregon State Univ, Openly Published Environm Sensing Lab, Biol & Ecol Engn, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA; [Goertzen, Luke; Selbie, William] Oregon State Univ, Openly Published Environm Sensing Lab, Comp Sci, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA",Oregon State University; Oregon State University,"DeBell, T (corresponding author), Oregon State Univ, Openly Published Environm Sensing Lab, Biol & Ecol Engn, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA.",debellt@oregonstate.edu,,"DeBell, Thomas/0000-0001-8770-4243","USDA National Institute of Food and Agriculture, Hatch project [NI18HFPXXXXXG055]; Agricultural Science Foundation at Oregon State University; Oregon State University Scaled Learning Innovation Grant; College of Agricultural Science","USDA National Institute of Food and Agriculture, Hatch project; Agricultural Science Foundation at Oregon State University; Oregon State University Scaled Learning Innovation Grant; College of Agricultural Science","This work was supported in part by the USDA National Institute of Food and Agriculture, Hatch project NI18HFPXXXXXG055, the Agricultural Science Foundation at Oregon State University, and Oregon State University Scaled Learning Innovation Grant.

IoT devices are currently being used in many fields. IoT devices use Wi-Fi and Bluetooth, however, communication distance is short and battery consumption is high. In areas such as smart cities and smart farms, IoT technology is needed to support a wide coverage with low power consumption. Low Power Wide Area (LPWA), which is a transmission used in IoT supporting a wide area with low power consumption, has evolved. LPWA includes Long Range (LoRa), Narrowband (NB-IoT), and Sigfox. LoRa offers many benefits as it communicates the longest distances, is cheap and consumes less battery. LoRa is used in many countries and covers a range of hundreds of square kilometers (km(2)) with a single gateway. However, if there are many obstacles to smart cities and smart farms, it causes communication problems. This paper proposes two (2) solutions to this problem: the relay method which is a multi-hop method and the Automatic Repeat Request (ARQ) system that detects packet loss in real-time and requests retransmission for LoRa. In this study, the actual performance of LoRa in the problematic environment was measured and the proposed method was applied. It was confirmed that the transmission rate of LoRa dropped when there were many obstacles such as trees. To use LoRa in a smart farm with a lot of space, multi-hop was observed to be better. An ARQ system is needed to compensate for the unexpected drop in the forward rate due to the increase in IoT devices. This research focused on reliability, however, additional network methods and automatic repeat request (ARQ) systems considering battery time should be researched in symmetry. This study covers the interdisciplinary field of computer science and wireless low power communication engineering. We have analyzed the LoRa/LoRaWAN technology in an experimental approach, which has been somewhat less studied than cellular network or WiFi technology. In addition, we presented and improved the performance evaluation results in consideration of various local and climatic environments.","[Choi, Rocksan] Kyung Hee Univ, Dept Comp Sci & Engn, Gyeonggi Do 17104, South Korea; [Lee, SeungGwan] Kyung Hee Univ, Humanitas Coll, Gyeonggi Do 17104, South Korea; [Lee, Sungwon] Kyung Hee Univ, Dept Software Convergence, Gyeonggi Do 17104, South Korea",Kyung Hee University; Kyung Hee University; Kyung Hee University,"Lee, S (corresponding author), Kyung Hee Univ, Dept Software Convergence, Gyeonggi Do 17104, South Korea.",rock3233@khu.ac.kr; leesg@khu.ac.kr; drsungwon@khu.ac.kr,,"Lee, SeungGwan/0000-0002-5510-390X",,,,,19,8,8,1,11,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2073-8994,,SYMMETRY-BASEL,Symmetry-Basel,APR,2020,12,4,,,,,,,552,10.3390/sym12040552,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/sym12040552,,,15,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Science & Technology - Other Topics,LY0NY,,gold,,,8/15/24,WOS:000540222200063,,0,174,,,

In this regard, Internet of Things (IoT) technologies provide versatile and powerful tools, constituting a modern trend in the design of sensing and data acquisition systems for I-V curve tracing. This paper presents a novel I-V curve tracer based on IoT open-source hardware and software. Namely, a Raspberry Pi microcomputer composes the hardware level, whilst the applied software comprises mariaDB, Python, and Grafana. All the tasks required for curve tracing are automated: load sweep, data acquisition, data storage, communications, and real-time visualization. Modern and legacy communication protocols are handled for seamless data exchange with a programmable logic controller and a programmable load. The development of the system is expounded, and experimental results are reported to prove the suitability and validity of the proposal.

However, the signal processing and audiological research needed to address these problems has long been hampered by proprietary development systems, underpowered embedded processors, and the difficulty of performing tests in real-world acoustical environments. To facilitate existing research in hearing healthcare and enable new investigations beyond what is currently possible, we have developed a modern, open-source hearing research platform, Open Speech Platform (OSP). This paper presents the system design of the complete OSP wearable platform, from hardware through firmware and software to user applications. The platform provides a complete suite of basic and advanced hearing aid features which can be adapted by researchers. It serves web apps directly from a hotspot on the wearable hardware, enabling users and researchers to control the system in real time. In addition, it can simultaneously acquire high-quality electroencephalography (EEG) or other electrophysiological signals closely synchronized to the audio. All of these features are provided in a wearable form factor with enough battery life for hours of operation in the field.","[Pisha, Louis; Lee, Ching-Hua; Mercier, Patrick P.; Rao, Bhaskar D.] Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Warchall, Julian] Booz Allen Hamilton, Arlington, VA 22203 USA; [Zubatiy, Tamara] Georgia Inst Technol, Sch Interact Comp, Atlanta, GA 30332 USA; [Hamilton, Sean; Gupta, Rajesh] Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Comp Sci & Engn, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Chockalingam, Ganz; Garudadri, Harinath] Univ Calif San Diego, Qualcomm Inst, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Gupta, Rajesh] Halicioglu Data Sci Inst, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA",University of California System; University of California San Diego; Booz Allen Hamilton Holding Corporation; University System of Georgia; Georgia Institute of Technology; University of California System; University of California San Diego; University of California System; University of California San Diego,"Pisha, L (corresponding author), Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA.",lpisha@eng.ucsd.edu,"Lee, Ching-Hua/AAE-7523-2021","Gupta, Rajesh/0000-0002-6489-7633; Garudadri, Harinath/0000-0003-0456-0956; Lee, Ching-Hua/0000-0001-6116-3653; Pisha, Louis A/0000-0001-5307-4263; Mercier, Patrick/0000-0003-1488-5076","National Institute of Health/National Institute on Deafness and Other communication Disorders (NIH/NIDCD) [R21DC015046, R33DC015046]; NIH/NIDCD [R01DC015436]; U.S. Army Research Laboratory [W911QX-16-C-0003]; National Science Foundation [DGE-114086]; National Science Foundation Division of Information & Intelligent Systems [IIS-1838830]",National Institute of Health/National Institute on Deafness and Other communication Disorders (NIH/NIDCD); NIH/NIDCD(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute on Deafness & Other Communication Disorders (NIDCD)); U.S. Army Research Laboratory(United States Department of DefenseUS Army Research Laboratory (ARL)); National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); National Science Foundation Division of Information & Intelligent Systems,"This work was supported in part by the National Institute of Health/National Institute on Deafness and Other communication Disorders (NIH/NIDCD) under Grant R21DC015046 and Grant R33DC015046, ""Self-fitting of Amplification: Methodology and Candidacy,"" in part by the NIH/NIDCD under Grant R01DC015436, ""A Real-time, Open, Portable, Extensible, Speech Lab,"" in part by the U.S. Army Research Laboratory under Contract W911QX-16-C-0003, in part by the National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship under Grant DGE-114086, and in part by the National Science Foundation Division of Information & Intelligent Systems under Grant IIS-1838830, ""A Framework for Optimizing Hearing Aids In Situ Based on Patient Feedback, Auditory Context, and Audiologist Input.""",,68,8,13,0,8,IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC,PISCATAWAY,"445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA",2169-3536,,,IEEE ACCESS,IEEE Access,,2019,7,,,,,,162083,162101,,10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2951145,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2951145,,,19,"Computer Science, Information Systems; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Telecommunications",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Computer Science; Engineering; Telecommunications,JN8VQ,32547893,"Green Accepted, Green Submitted, gold",,,8/15/24,WOS:000497169800092,,0,176,,,

The Strand Centi-Sizer was a low-cost, fused filament fabrication 3-D printable device that increased experiment preparation efficiency and standardized the cutting of egg strands customizable to user needs. A downstream system of 3-D printed devices was also prototyped to address inefficiencies in handling of egg strand sections for processing and packaging into existing cryopreservation straw platforms. Time studies were conducted comparing manual methods (i.e., no specialized equipment) with open hardware to demonstrate utility of the devices and to encourage community members to design and prototype new devices to address recurrent and novel problems in other aquatic animals that produce egg strands.

The traditional, design-limiting periodicity in material design is overcome by utilizing Wang tiles to achieve compatibility among building blocks. We illustrate our approach with the design and manufacturing of an L-shaped domain inspired by a scissor-like soft gripper, whose internal module distribution was optimized to achieve an extreme tilt of a tip of the gripper's jaw when the handle part was uniformly compressed. The geometry of individual modules was built on a 3 x 3 grid of elliptical holes with varying semi-axes ratios and alternating orientations. We optimized the distribution of the modules within the L-shaped domain using an enumeration approach combined with a factorial search strategy. To address the challenge of seamless interface connections in modular manufacturing, we produced the final designs by casting silicone rubber into modular molds automatically assembled by a robotic arm. The predicted performance was validated experimentally using a custom-built, open-hardware test rig, Thymos, supplemented with digital image correlation measurements. Our study demonstrates the potential for enhancing the mechanical performance of architectured materials by incorporating nonuniform modular designs and efficient robot-assisted manufacturing.","[Doskar, Martin; Somr, Michael; Hluzek, Radim; Zeman, Jan] Czech Tech Univ, Fac Civil Engn, Dept Mech, Thakurova 7, Prague 6, Czech Republic; [Hluzek, Radim; Havelka, Jan; Novak, Jan] Czech Tech Univ, Fac Civil Engn, Expt Ctr, Thakurova 7, Prague 6, Czech Republic",Czech Technical University Prague; Czech Technical University Prague,"Dosk√°r, M (corresponding author), Czech Tech Univ, Fac Civil Engn, Dept Mech, Thakurova 7, Prague 6, Czech Republic.",martin.doskar@cvut.cz; michael.somr@fsv.cvut.cz; radim.hluzek@fsv.cvut.cz; jan.havelka@fsv.cvut.cz; novakja@fsv.cvut.cz; jan.zeman@cvut.cz,"Zeman, Jan/A-1452-2009; Somr, Michael/F-9922-2019; Nov√°k, Jan/C-7846-2018; Doskar, Martin/C-7097-2018","Zeman, Jan/0000-0003-2503-8120; Somr, Michael/0000-0002-0540-4763; Doskar, Martin/0000-0001-7581-0567",Czech Science Foundation [19-26143X],Czech Science Foundation(Grant Agency of the Czech Republic),"The authors thank the Intelligent and Mobile Robotics (IMR) group at the Czech Institute of Informatics, Robotics and Cybernetics, CTU in Prague for granting us an access to the dual-arm ABB IRB 14000 YuMi collaborative robot.

Retrieval of animal-borne devices is often advantageous for several reasons, including data retrieval and animal welfare considerations; however, commercially available drop-off units are often prohibitively expensive and/or unreliable. Here, we present 'OpenDropOff', an open-source, low-cost electronic drop-off unit for remotely detaching animal-borne sensors from individuals. OpenDropOff devices function by using heat, produced by running an electrical current through resistance wire (nichrome), to melt nylon (e.g. fishing) line, detaching sensors from animals at or after a pre-determined time. OpenDropOff can be constructed using commercially available components (costing < USD $15 in total; approximately 10% or less of many commercially available drop-off units) and can be customized to fit project- and species-specific needs. Fourteen OpenDropOff devices have been field deployed on koalas (Phascolarctos cinereus) (n = 11), swamp wallaby (Wallabia bicolor) (n = 1), Australian brush turkey (Alectura lathami) (n = 1) and Australian white ibis (Threskiornis molucca) (n = 1), with the only detachment failure occurring after a device was damaged during the koala's unrelated death. OpenDropOff devices provide a wider range of researchers with a reliable, cost-effective tool for detaching animal-borne sensors. Their use could allow researchers to more efficiently allocate project resources, and their flexibility provides an opportunity to mitigate animal welfare concerns surrounding the use of animal-borne devices.","[Rafiq, Kasim] Liverpool John Moores Univ, Sch Nat Sci & Psychol, Liverpool, Merseyside, England; [Rafiq, Kasim; Jordan, Neil R.] Botswana Predator Conservat Trust, Maun, Botswana; [Appleby, Rob G.; Dexter, Cathryn E.; Jones, Darryl N.; Blacker, Amy R.

Threats to ecosystems can go undetected for years or decades as a result. Real-time data can help solve this issue but significant technical barriers exist. For example, automated camera traps are widely used for ecosystem monitoring but it is challenging to transmit images for real-time analysis where there is no reliable cellular or WiFi connectivity. We modified an off-the-shelf camera trap (Bushnell (TM)) and customised existing open-source hardware to create a 'smart' camera trap system. Images captured by the camera trap are instantly labelled by an artificial intelligence model and an 'alert' containing the image label and other metadata is then delivered to the end-user within minutes over the Iridium satellite network. We present results from testing in the Netherlands, Europe, and from a pilot test in a closed-canopy forest in Gabon, Central Africa. All reference materials required to build the system are provided in open-source repositories. Results show the system can operate for a minimum of 3 months without intervention when capturing a median of 17.23 images per day. The median time-difference between image capture and receiving an alert was 7.35 min, though some outliers showed delays of 5-days or more when the system was incorrectly positioned and unable to connect to the Iridium network. We anticipate significant developments in this field and hope that the solutions presented here, and the lessons learned, can be used to inform future advances. New artificial intelligence models and the addition of other sensors such as microphones will expand the system's potential for other, real-time use cases including real-time biodiversity monitoring, wild resource management and detecting illegal human activities in protected areas.","[Whytock, Robin C.; Orbell, Christopher; White, Lee J.

Existing systems require precise mechanical control, and the cost is prohibitive for most individual pathologists. Here we report a low-cost and high-throughput WSI system termed OpenWSI. The reported system is built using off-the-shelf components, including a programmable LED array, a photographic lens, and a low-cost computer numerical control (CNC) router. Different from conventional WSI platforms, our system performs real-time single-frame autofocusing using color-multiplexed illumination. For axial positioning control, we perform coarse adjustment using the CNC router and precise adjustment using the ultrasonic motor ring in the photographic lens. By using a 20X objective lens, we show that the OpenWSI system has a resolution of similar to 0.7 mu m. It can acquire whole slide images of a 225 mm(2) region in similar to 2 mins with throughput comparable to existing high-end platforms.

These plants face several technical problems and the inspection of components such as absorber tubes in parabolic trough concentrators (PTC), which are widely deployed, is necessary to guarantee plant efficiency. This article presents a system for real-time industrial inspection of CSP plants using low-cost, open-source components in conjunction with a thermographic sensor and an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). The system, available in open-source hardware and software, is designed to be employed independently of the type of device used for inspection (laptop, smartphone, tablet or smartglasses) and its operating system. Several UAV flight missions were programmed as follows: flight altitudes at 20, 40, 60, 80, 100 and 120 m above ground level; and three cruising speeds: 5, 7 and 10 m/s. These settings were chosen and analyzed in order to optimize inspection time. The results indicate that it is possible to perform inspections by an UAV in real time at CSP plants as a means of detecting anomalous absorber tubes and improving the effectiveness of methodologies currently being utilized. Moreover, aside from thermographic sensors, this contribution can be applied to other sensors and can be used in a broad range of applications where real-time georeferenced data visualization is necessary.","[Javier Mesas-Carrascosa, Francisco; Verdu Santano, Daniel; Perez Porras, Fernando; Emilio Merono-Larriva, Jose; Garcia-Ferrer, Alfonso] Univ Cordoba, Dept Graph Engn & Geomat, Campus Rabanales, E-14071 Cordoba, Spain",Universidad de Cordoba,"Mesas-Carrascosa, FJ (corresponding author), Univ Cordoba, Dept Graph Engn & Geomat, Campus Rabanales, E-14071 Cordoba, Spain.",fjmesas@uco.es; p12vesad@uco.es; perezporras.fernando@gmail.com; ir1melaj@uco.es; agferrer@uco.es,"P√©rez Porras, Fernando/AIC-7686-2022; Garc√≠a-Ferrer, Alfonso/Q-8365-2019; Mesas-Carrascosa, Francisco Javier/L-3094-2017","P√©rez Porras, Fernando/0000-0003-4263-2260; Garc√≠a-Ferrer, Alfonso/0000-0002-7558-400X; Mesas-Carrascosa, Francisco Javier/0000-0002-5674-1292",Khepri project - CDTI: Centro para el Desarrollo Tecnologico Industrial; FEDER Funds: Fondo Europeo de Desarrollo Regional; CTA: Corporacion Tecnologica de Andalucia,Khepri project - CDTI: Centro para el Desarrollo Tecnologico Industrial; FEDER Funds: Fondo Europeo de Desarrollo Regional; CTA: Corporacion Tecnologica de Andalucia,"This research was funded by Khepri project supported by CDTI: Centro para el Desarrollo Tecnologico Industrial, FEDER Funds: Fondo Europeo de Desarrollo Regional and CTA: Corporacion Tecnologica de Andalucia.

However, their computational demands are also growing, which constraints their use in mobile and time-sensitive robots. Biological vision presents a well known practical solution. Specifically, primates limit the computational demands of vision by processing only small parts of the scene in detail, and frequently reorienting the eyes to different locations. Artificial vision is much more power-intensive than biological vision, so this strategy is likely to be increasingly relevant to robots, as they become more visually sophisticated. To facilitate progress and reduce duplication of work in this area, we have developed a 7-degree-of-freedom robotic head that supports such rapid saccade-like camera movements, and we are releasing the design files under an open-hardware license. The system supports C-mount cameras, large foveated lenses, and liquid lenses that allow rapid changes in focus distance. It also has a stereo baseline that is roughly the same as that of humans, to support stereo processing of nearby objects in grasping and manipulation tasks. The main contributions of this work are the mechanical design, and the demonstration that its stereo baseline, range of motion, and saccade velocity are similar to those of primate systems. The main general advantages over existing robotic heads are speed and the open-hardware license. The system would also be an ideal platform for future research that aims to replicate the performance of primate vision systems.","[Huber, Scott] Axcendo Innovat Corp, Toronto, ON M6H 1B5, Canada; [Selby, Ben; Tripp, Bryan] Univ Waterloo, Dept Syst Design Engn, Waterloo, ON N2G 3G1, Canada",University of Waterloo,"Tripp, B (corresponding author), Univ Waterloo, Dept Syst Design Engn, Waterloo, ON N2G 3G1, Canada.",scott@axcendo.com; bselby@uwaterloo.ca; bptripp@uwaterloo.ca,,"Tripp, Bryan/0000-0002-2150-297X",Canadian Foundation for Innovation; Research Infrastructure grant from the Ontario Research Fund; Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada; Axcendo Innovation Corporation,Canadian Foundation for Innovation(Canada Foundation for Innovation); Research Infrastructure grant from the Ontario Research Fund; Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada(Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)CGIAR); Axcendo Innovation Corporation,"This work was supported in part by a Leaders' Opportunity Fund grant from the Canadian Foundation for Innovation, in part by the Research Infrastructure grant from the Ontario Research Fund, in part by the Discovery Grant from the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada, and in part by the Axcendo Innovation Corporation.",,35,1,1,0,10,IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC,PISCATAWAY,"445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA",2377-3766,,,IEEE ROBOT AUTOM LET,IEEE Robot.

However, moderate miniaturization offers many advantages and together with the transfer of modern print and media technologies to the field of chromatography (office chromatography) it opens up new avenues. This is demonstrated in an allin-one open-source system developed for planar chromatography and especially for ultrathin-layer chromatography. Using an InkShield board to control a thermal inkjet cartridge, picoliter drops were printed at a resolution of 96 dpi on the adsorbent layer. Using Marlin, a popular firmware in 3D printing, Cartesian movement of the print head was made possible for full control of the printing process. Open-source software was developed to control the device in each operation step. Sample solutions and mobile phase were inkjet-printed, exemplarily shown for the analysis of dye- or paraben-mixture solutions. Light-emitting diodes (LEDs) were investigated for documentation. For example, deep UV LEDs gave access to 254 nm light, and RGB LEDs gave access to the visible-light range. Calibration functions with correlation coefficients superior to 0.999 were obtained by videodensitometry. The developed modular open-source hardware was compact (26 X 31 X 26 cm(3)), light (<3 kg), and affordable ((sic)810). For the given analyses, the footprint of current instrumentation needed was miniaturized by a factor of 9. The highly reduced material design complies with green chemistry and lean laboratory. The design and instruction to reproduce the all-in-one open-source system were made freely available at https://github.com/OfficeChromatography.

This is especially true if we are to gain insights into one of the least studied aspects: the potential perturbations that neurotoxicants can have on cognitive behaviors. The paucity of experimental data is partly caused by a lack of low-cost technologies for the analysis of higher-level neurological functions (e.g., associative learning) in small aquatic organisms. Here, we present a proof-of-concept prototype that utilizes a new real-time animal tracking software for on-the-fly video analysis and closed-loop, external hardware communications to deliver stimuli based on specific behaviors in aquatic organisms, spanning three animal phyla: chordates (fish, frog), platyhelminthes (flatworm), and arthropods (crustacean). The system's open-source software features an intuitive graphical user interface and advanced adaptive threshold-based image segmentation for precise animal detection. We demonstrate the precision of animal tracking across multiple aquatic species with varying modes of locomotion. The presented technology interfaces easily with low-cost and open-source hardware such as the Arduino microcontroller family for closed-loop stimuli control. The new system has potential future applications in eco-neurotoxicology, where it could enable new opportunities for cognitive research in diverse small aquatic model organisms.","[Bai, Yutao; Henry, Jason; Wlodkowic, Donald] RMIT Univ, Sch Sci, Neurotoxicol Lab, Melbourne, Vic 3083, Australia; [Cheng, Eva; Perry, Stuart] Univ Technol Sydney, Fac Engn & IT, Sch Elect & Data Engn, Sydney, NSW 2007, Australia; [Mawdsley, David] Def Sci & Technol Grp, Melbourne, Vic 3207, Australia; [Wong, Bob B.

This novel experimental approach allows the application of the following stimuli to an ex vivo vessel in a physiological bath: (a) a realistic intravascular pressure waveform defined by the user; (b) shear stress in the endothelial layer since, in addition to the pressure waveform, the flow through the vessel can be independently controlled by the user; (c) conditions of hypo/hyperoxia and hypo/hypercapnia in an intravascular circulating medium. These stimuli can be applied alone or in different combinations to study possible synergistic or antagonistic effects. The setting performance is illustrated by a proof of concept in an ex vivo rabbit aorta. The experimental setting is easy to build by using very low-cost materials widely available.

The miniaturization of mass-produced actuators and sensors enables the use of technically extremely complex functions in smartphones at a very low price. They can be used to implement modern microscopy methods for use in places where access to such techniques is often very limited. In this review, we show how easy it is to integrate a smartphone into the everyday microscopy-imaging routines of biology research. Such devices have also been used to identify diseases directly at the patient. Furthermore, we demonstrate how constantly increasing computing power in combination with the steadily improving imaging quality of cameras of handheld devices enables the realization of new biomedical imaging methods, which together with commercially available and 3D-printed components make current research available to a broad mass.

There is currently a lack of low-cost solutions that allow manipulation of process parameters and expansion of sensors to monitor the printer as well as the process. This paper presents an open-source hardware upgrade for low-cost 3D printers to enable research on new high-temperature polymers as well as manufacturing from all currently available polymers. The hardware cost less than $1700, including the printer. Open-source firmware by Klipper and Fluidd is used for control. The printer is able to reach 500 degrees C nozzle, 200 degrees C heated bed, and 135 degrees C heated chamber with all electronics inside operating within the recommended temperature range. The presented design produced a CF-PEEK 3DBenchy and a spiral vase with excellent surface quality and no signs of delam-ination. Test specimens according to ISO527 using PA-CF performed similarly to the data-sheet provided by the manufacturer for samples produced in the XY-orientation and outperformed the datasheet by 15 % in the ZX direction. Compared to specimens made on an Original Prusa i3 MK3S, the modified printer produced specimens with 22% higher strength in the YX-direction and 25% in ZX. By continuously monitoring and carefully cal-ibrating both hardware and firmware, the presented design can perform as a research tool in material science and produce large-scale components of high-performance polymers.(c) 2022 The Author(s).

Here we demonstrate the conceptualization and validation of a closed-loop DBS system using open-source hardware. We used hippocampal theta oscillations as system input, and electrical stimulation in the mesencephalic reticular formation (mRt) as controller output. It is well documented that hippocampal theta oscillations are highly related to locomotion, while electrical stimulation in the mRt induces freezing. We used an Arduino open-source microcontroller between input and output sources. This allowed us to use hippocampal local field potentials (LFPs) to steer electrical stimulation in the mRt. Our results showed that closed-loop DBS significantly suppressed locomotion compared to no stimulation, and required on average only 56% of the stimulation used in open-loop DBS to reach similar effects. The main advantages of open-source hardware include wide selection and availability, high customizability, and affordability. Our open-source closed-loop DBS system is effective, and warrants further research using open-source hardware for closed-loop neuromodulation.","[Wu, Hemmings; Beeckmans, Dorien; van Kuyck, Kris; Nuttin, Bart] Katholieke Univ Leuven, Res Grp Expt Neurosurg & Neuroanat, Leuven, Belgium; [Ghekiere, Hartwin; Tambuyzer, Tim; Aerts, Jean-Marie] Katholieke Univ Leuven, BIORES Measure Model & Manage Bioresponses M3, Dept Biosyst, Leuven, Belgium; [Nuttin, Bart] Univ Hosp Leuven, Dept Neurosurg, Leuven, Belgium",KU Leuven; KU Leuven; KU Leuven; University Hospital Leuven,"Wu, H (corresponding author), Katholieke Univ Leuven, Res Grp Expt Neurosurg & Neuroanat, Leuven, Belgium.",Hemmings.Wu@kuleuven.be,,,"agency for Innovation by Science and Technology (IWT: Baekeland Mandate) [100683]; agency for Innovation by Science and Technology (SBO BrainSTAR); Interdisciplinary Research Programmes of KU Leuven [IDO/12/024]; Research Foundation - Flanders (FWO) [12L4812N, G.0729.09, G.0A55.13]",agency for Innovation by Science and Technology (IWT: Baekeland Mandate)(Institute for the Promotion of Innovation by Science and Technology in Flanders (IWT)); agency for Innovation by Science and Technology (SBO BrainSTAR); Interdisciplinary Research Programmes of KU Leuven; Research Foundation - Flanders (FWO)(FWO),"This study was supported by the agency for Innovation by Science and Technology (IWT: Baekeland Mandate (100683) and SBO BrainSTAR), the Interdisciplinary Research Programmes of KU Leuven (IDO/12/024), and the Research Foundation - Flanders (FWO: 12L4812N, G.0729.09 and G.0A55.13).

From a tribological point of view, these are often linked to the reduction of wear and friction. When testing new materials, coating systems or lubricants, the underlying mechanisms and physical relationships are investigated by the deployment of simplified model tests. Advanced commercial test rigs allow high -resolution measurement of important friction and wear parameters, but also entail a considerable cost and thus a certain entry barrier to deal further with tribological aspects. In many research projects, therefore, self -developed test rigs are used, which at the same time, however, makes comparability and reproducibility with other systems considerably more difficult. For this reason, we have developed a pin -on -disc tribometer based on the open hardware approach, which can be completely additively manufactured by fused filament fabrication. In addition to presenting the customizable measurement system, we investigated the measurement capability using 50 repeated measurements on two different tribological test systems. The reproducibility of the measured values was 0.4 % and 1.1 % for friction and 0.6 % and 1.0 % for wear and was thus considerably lower than the standard deviation in the tests on a single tribometer, which was up to 7.7 % and 16.1 % for friction and wear, respectively. So, the presented tribometer can be used, for example, to perform high throughput tests and thus to detect systematic correlations, e.g., in combination with machine learning approaches. Another area of application is training and education of students and professionals.","[Orgeldinger, Christian; Rosnitschek, Tobias; Tremmel, Stephan] Univ Bayreuth, Engn Design & CAD, Univ Str 30, D-95447 Bayreuth, Germany",University of Bayreuth,"Orgeldinger, C (corresponding author), Univ Bayreuth, Engn Design & CAD, Univ Str 30, D-95447 Bayreuth, Germany.",christian.orgeldinger@uni-bayreuth.de,,,University of Bayreuth,University of Bayreuth,"The authors greatly acknowledge the continuous support of the University of Bayreuth.

To make sure that the plastic structural parts can withstand the stress of dynamic locomotion, we performed finite element analysis (FEA) on leg structural parts as well as a continuous walking test using the physical robot, both of which the robot has passed successfully.

Recently, human and rodent studies using virtual reality (VR) environments have shown VR to be an important tool for uncovering the neural mechanisms underlying spatial learning in the hippocampus and cortex, due to the extremely precise control over parameters such as spatial and contextual cues. Setting up virtual environments for rodent spatial behaviors can, however, be costly and require an extensive background in engineering and computer programming. Here, we present a simple yet powerful system based upon inexpensive, modular, open-source hardware and software that enables researchers to study spatial learning in head-restrained mice using a VR environment. This system uses coupled microcontrollers to measure locomotion and deliver behavioral stimuli while head-restrained mice run on a wheel in concert with a virtual linear track environment rendered by a graphical software package running on a single-board computer. The emphasis on distributed processing allows researchers to design flexible, modular systems to elicit and measure complex spatial behaviors in mice in order to determine the connection between neural circuit activity and spatial learning in the mammalian brain.","[Lacefield, Clay; Cai, Hongtao; Ho, Huong; Dias, Carla; Chung, Hannah; Hen, Rene; Turi, Gergely F.] New York State Psychiat Inst & Hosp, Div Syst Neurosci, New York, NY 10032 USA; [Lacefield, Clay; Hen, Rene; Turi, Gergely F.] Columbia Univ, Dept Psychiat, New York, NY 10027 USA",New York State Psychiatry Institute; Columbia University,"Lacefield, C; Turi, GF (corresponding author), New York State Psychiat Inst & Hosp, Div Syst Neurosci, New York, NY 10032 USA.; Lacefield, C; Turi, GF (corresponding author), Columbia Univ, Dept Psychiat, New York, NY 10027 USA.",col8@cumc.columbia.edu; gt2253@cumc.columbia.edu,"Turi, Gergely/G-5054-2019","Turi, Gergely/0000-0001-5651-9459","BBRF Young Investigator Award; NIMH [1R21MH122965, R01MH068542]; NINDS [R56NS128177]",BBRF Young Investigator Award; NIMH(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH)); NINDS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Neurological Disorders & Stroke (NINDS)),"We would like to thank Noah Pettit from the Harvey lab for the discussion and suggestions while developing the protocol in this manuscript.

The complex inner geometry of conventional slot dies require expensive machining that limits accessibility and experimentation. In order to overcome these issues this study follows an open hardware approach, which uses an open source 3-D printer to both fabricate the slot die and then to functionalize a 3-D slot die printing system. Polymer materials are tested and selected for compatibility with common solvents and used to fabricate a custom slot die head. This slot die is then integrated into a 3-D printer augmented with a syringe pump to form an additive manufacturing platform for thin film semiconductor devices. The full design of the slot die system is disclosed here using an open source license including software and operational protocols. This study demonstrates that functional lab-grade slot dies may be 3-D printed using low-cost open source hardware methods A case study using NiO2 found an RMS value 0.486 nm, thickness of 17-49 nm, and a maximum optical transmission of 99.1%, which shows this additive manufacturing approach to slot die depositions as well of fabrication is capable of producing viable layers of advanced electronic materials.

A challenge in this setting is to figure out a fast and cost-effective method of TVWS presence estimation, such as the use of open hardware and software tools, reducing sensing time. This article proposes a Rapid Estimation Method (REM) for TVWS estimation that uses the statistical information of the sensed signals. Our probabilistic approach analyzes the collected parameters of more than eight million data samples taken by scanning the TV-UHF spectrum in the city of Windsor, ON, Canada. The calculated statistical parameters and a group of auxiliary parameters were combined to estimate rapidly the amount of TVWS available in the sensed locations. By applying the proposed rapid estimation method, the presence of TVWS was identified and verified with an accuracy of about 76% according to the results obtained, the average variation when comparing the calculated and detected probabilities of TVWS was in a range of 15%, and the method could be a viable solution to the spectrum need.","[Corral-De-Witt, Danilo; Ahmed, Sabbir; Tepe, Kemal] Univ Windsor, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, Windsor, ON N9B 3P4, Canada; [Corral-De-Witt, Danilo] Univ Fuerzas Armadas ESPE, Dept Elect & Elect, Sangolqui 171103, Ecuador; [Rojo-Alvarez, Jose Luis] Univ Rey Juan Carlos, Dept Teoria Senal & Comunicac Sistemas Telemat & C, Madrid 28933, Spain",University of Windsor; Escuela Politecnica Superior del Ejercito; Universidad Rey Juan Carlos,"Corral-De-Witt, D (corresponding author), Univ Windsor, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, Windsor, ON N9B 3P4, Canada.; Corral-De-Witt, D (corresponding author), Univ Fuerzas Armadas ESPE, Dept Elect & Elect, Sangolqui 171103, Ecuador.",corraldd@uwindsor.ca; sabbir1009@yahoo.com; joseluis.rojo@urjc.es; ktepe@uwindsor.ca,"Rojo-√Ålvarez, Jose Luis/F-6520-2016","Rojo-√Ålvarez, Jose Luis/0000-0003-0426-8912","Secretaria de Educacion Superior, Ciencia, Tecnologia e Innovacion (SENESCYT) of Ecuador; University of Windsor","Secretaria de Educacion Superior, Ciencia, Tecnologia e Innovacion (SENESCYT) of Ecuador; University of Windsor","This work was supported by the Secretaria de Educacion Superior, Ciencia, Tecnologia e Innovacion (SENESCYT) of Ecuador and the University of Windsor.

Guidelines for the management of the elder with falls are comprised of multidimensional assessments, especially gait and balance. Daily clinical practice needs for timely, effortless, and precise tools to assess gait. This work presents the clinical validation of the G-STRIDE system, a 6-axis inertial measurement unit (IMU) with onboard processing algorithms, that allows the calculation of walking-related metrics correlated with clinical markers of fall risk. A cross-sectional case-control study was conducted with 163 participants (falls and non-falls groups). All volunteers were assessed with clinical scales and conducted a 15-min walking test at a self-selected pace while wearing the G-STRIDE. G-STRIDE is a low-cost solution to facilitate the transfer to society and clinical evaluations. It is open hardware and flexible and, thus, has the advantage of providing runtime data processing. Walking descriptors were derived from the device, and a correlation analysis was conducted between walking and clinical variables. G-STRIDE allowed measuring walking parameters in non-restricted walking conditions (e.g. hallway). Walking parameters statistically discriminate between falls and non-falls groups. We found good/excellent estimation accuracy (ICC = 0.885; p < 0.000 ) for walking speed, showing good/excellent correlation between gait speed and several clinical variables.

In the last decades, modern devices allow simultaneous recordings of different operant responses and the electrical activity of large neuronal populations. However, the commercially available instruments for studying operant conditioning are expensive, and the design of low-cost chambers has emerged as an appealing alternative to resource-limited laboratories engaged in animal behavior. In this article, we provide a full description of a platform that records the operant behavior and synchronizes it with the electrophysiological activity. The programming of this platform is open source, flexible, and adaptable to a wide range of operant conditioning tasks.

Artificial insemination is an essential approach used to establish hybrid lines and for the operation of sperm repositories. The existing mouth-pipetting technique for artificial insemination of live-bearing fishes has not been substantially upgraded since the first implementation in the 1950s. This work developed a low-cost standardized artificial inseminator device (SAID) as open hardware to address issues routinely encountered in insemination by mouth-pipetting, including lack of reproducibility among different users, difficulty in training, and large, unreportable variation in sample volume and pressure during insemination. Community-level enhancements of the SAID prototype could enable standardized insemination with minimal training and facilitate the participation of research communities in the use of cryopreserved genetic resources. Small-bodied live-bearing fishes attract broad attention because of their importance in biomedical research and critical conservation status in natural habitats. Artificial insemination is an essential process to establish hybrid lines and for the operation of sperm repositories. The existing mouth-pipetting technique for artificial insemination of live-bearing fishes has not been substantially upgraded since the first implementation in the 1950s. The goal of this work was to develop a standardized artificial inseminator device (SAID) to address issues routinely encountered in insemination by mouth-pipetting, including lack of reproducibility among different users, difficulty in training, and large unreportable variation in sample volume and pressure during insemination. Prototypes of the SAID were designed as relatively inexpensive (<USD 80) open hardware based on commercially available and 3-D printed components to enable broad community access. A linear actuator was used to accurately control the position of a piston for fluid transfer with a standard deviation of <0.1 mm over a 4 mm range of travel. The volume of sample transfer was precisely controlled with a linear relationship (r(2) > 0.99) between the piston position and volume. Pressure generation from eight mouth-pipetting operators and SAID prototypes were assessed by pressure sensors. The pressure control by SAID was superior to that produced by mouth-pipetting, yielding lower pressures (31-483 Pa) and smaller variations (standard deviation <11 Pa). These pressures were sufficient to deliver 1-5 mu L of fluid into female reproductive tracts yet low enough to avoid physical injury to fish. Community-level enhancements of the SAID prototype could enable standardized insemination with minimal training and facilitate the participation of research communities in the use of cryopreserved genetic resources.","[Harmon, Elise R.; Liu, Yue; Browning, Valentino; Monroe, William Todd] Louisiana State Univ, Dept Biol & Agr Engn, Baton Rouge, LA 70803 USA; [Harmon, Elise R.; Liu, Yue; Shamkhalichenar, Hamed; Tiersch, Terrence R.] Louisiana State Univ, Aquat Germplasm & Genet Resources Ctr, Sch Renewable Nat Resources, Agr Ctr, Baton Rouge, LA 70820 USA; [Shamkhalichenar, Hamed] Louisiana State Univ, Sch Elect Engn & Comp Sci, Baton Rouge, LA 70803 USA; [Savage, Markita] Texas State Univ, Xiphophorus Genet Stock Ctr, San Marcos, TX 78666 USA",Louisiana State University System; Louisiana State University; Louisiana State University System; Louisiana State University; Louisiana State University System; Louisiana State University; Texas State University System; Texas State University San Marcos,"Monroe, WT (corresponding author), Louisiana State Univ, Dept Biol & Agr Engn, Baton Rouge, LA 70803 USA.",eliseharmon1@gmail.com; yliu@agcenter.lsu.edu; hamed.shamkhali@gmail.com; vdudz1234@gmail.com; markita@txstate.edu; ttiersch@agcenter.lsu.edu; tmonroe@lsu.edu,"Shamkhalichenar, Hamed/Y-6496-2019","Monroe, William Todd/0000-0002-7889-3799; Tiersch, Terrence/0000-0002-7738-1978; Liu, Yue/0000-0003-3838-8277","LSU-ACRES Audubon Center for Research of Endangered Species (LSU-ACRES Collaborative Projects); Louisiana Sea Grant Undergraduate Research Opportunity Program (UROP); National Institutes of Health, Office of Research Infrastructure Programs [R24-OD010441, R24-OD028443]; National Institute of Food and Agriculture, United States Department of Agriculture [LAB94420, NC1194]; Louisiana State University Research & Technology Foundation [AG-2019-LIFT-005]; NIH Office of the Director [R24OD010441] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER","LSU-ACRES Audubon Center for Research of Endangered Species (LSU-ACRES Collaborative Projects); Louisiana Sea Grant Undergraduate Research Opportunity Program (UROP); National Institutes of Health, Office of Research Infrastructure Programs; National Institute of Food and Agriculture, United States Department of Agriculture(United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)); Louisiana State University Research & Technology Foundation; NIH Office of the Director(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH Office of the Director)","This work was supported in part by funding from the LSU-ACRES Audubon Center for Research of Endangered Species (LSU-ACRES Collaborative Projects), the Louisiana Sea Grant Undergraduate Research Opportunity Program (UROP), and the National Institutes of Health, Office of Research Infrastructure Programs (R24-OD010441 and R24-OD028443), with additional support provided by the National Institute of Food and Agriculture, United States Department of Agriculture (Hatch Projects LAB94420 and NC1194), and the Louisiana State University Research & Technology Foundation (AG-2019-LIFT-005).",,50,4,4,0,2,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",2076-2615,,,ANIMALS-BASEL,Animals,APR,2022,12,8,,,,,,,961,10.3390/ani12080961,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ani12080961,,,15,"Agriculture, Dairy & Animal Science; Veterinary Sciences; Zoology",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Agriculture; Veterinary Sciences; Zoology,0Q8DX,35454209,"Green Published, gold",,,8/15/24,WOS:000785143300001,,0,204,,,

However, it is already known that shared memory is vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks since mechanisms to check integrity or authenticate callers for the shared memory payload are not supported in TrustZone. While an encryption-based method that resolves this limitation does exist, there are some architectural limitations. Indeed, even with key protection countermeasures applied, there is a risk that encryption keys may be leaked, as they are placed in insecure user memory during communication. Moreover, countermeasures for key leakage cause system performance overhead. In this paper, we propose a lightweight and secure scheme for shared memory, called Software One-Time Programmable Memory (SOTPM). SOTPM is a software-implemented, one-time programmable shared memory. It is based on the idea that payload encryption in the shared memory layer is unnecessary because sensitive data is already encrypted in the application layer before being written to the shared memory. SOTPM is set to read-only after data is written into SOTPM due to the one-time programmable characteristic. Therefore, attackers are unable to manipulate content in SOTPM during communication. Since it is not necessary for SOTPM to encrypt the payload in order to prevent malicious payload manipulation, it is possible to remove the risk of key leakage posed in previous studies. Additionally, in contrast with the existing method, our method can dramatically reduce system performance overhead. We implemented our prototype on an open-source hardware board with an Armv8-A processor and performed a security analysis and performance evaluation. The results show that SOTPM provides a sufficient level of security and less than 1% performance overhead, implying that SOTPM is a reasonable solution for current commercial products.","[Shim, Dongwook; Lee, Dong Hoon] Korea Univ, Grad Sch Informat Secur, Seoul 02841, South Korea",Korea University,"Lee, DH (corresponding author), Korea Univ, Grad Sch Informat Secur, Seoul 02841, South Korea.",donghlee@korea.ac.kr,,"Shim, Dongwook/0000-0003-4615-9546",Korea University Grant,Korea University Grant,This work was supported by the Korea University Grant.,,45,2,3,1,7,IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC,PISCATAWAY,"445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA",2169-3536,,,IEEE ACCESS,IEEE Access,,2021,9,,,,,,4490,4504,,10.1109/ACCESS.2020.3047813,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2020.3047813,,,15,"Computer Science, Information Systems; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Telecommunications",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Computer Science; Engineering; Telecommunications,PS0ZU,,gold,,,8/15/24,WOS:000607661300001,,0,205,,,

Algorithm development and functional testing are among the most complex and time-consuming phases of lithium-ion battery management system design. Furthermore, the use of real batteries in those phases introduces safety hazards. The hardware-in-the-loop approach allows the designers to overcome these limitations by replacing real batteries with hardware emulators. This article presents a low-cost battery emulator platform to reproduce the main electrical and thermal behaviors of elementary battery cells. The platform allows the user to manually control the emulator outputs or automatically reproduce specific voltage, temperature, and current profiles. In addition, the platform can independently reproduce the battery cell behaviors by using a customizable 2-RC equivalent electrical model. The functional testing and the balancing algorithm assessment of a custom battery management system are used as a case study to evaluate the developed battery emulator platform. Results demonstrate the effective advantages of the developed platform to assess the battery management system safety functionalities and algorithms. Finally, the platform is made freely available to accelerate research and innovation in the field of energy storage technology.","[Verani, Alessandro; Di Rienzo, Roberto; Nicodemo, Niccolo; Baronti, Federico; Roncella, Roberto; Saletti, Roberto] Univ Pisa, Dipartimento Ingn Informaz, I-56122 Pisa, Italy",University of Pisa,"Di Rienzo, R (corresponding author), Univ Pisa, Dipartimento Ingn Informaz, I-56122 Pisa, Italy.",roberto.dirienzo@unipi.it,,"DI RIENZO, ROBERTO/0000-0002-4238-5864; Nicodemo, Niccolo/0000-0001-8322-4250","Centro Nazionale di Mobilit Sostenibile (MOST)-Sustainable Mobility Center funded by the European Union Next-GenerationEU (Piano Nazionale di Ripresa e Resilienza (PNRR)-Missione 4 Componente 2, Investimento 1.4-D.D. 1033 17/06/2022)","Centro Nazionale di Mobilit Sostenibile (MOST)-Sustainable Mobility Center funded by the European Union Next-GenerationEU (Piano Nazionale di Ripresa e Resilienza (PNRR)-Missione 4 Componente 2, Investimento 1.4-D.D. 1033 17/06/2022)",No Statement Available,,56,0,0,4,4,IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC,PISCATAWAY,"445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA",2169-3536,,,IEEE ACCESS,IEEE Access,,2024,12,,,,,,84488,84497,,10.1109/ACCESS.2024.3413187,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2024.3413187,,,10,"Computer Science, Information Systems; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Telecommunications",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Computer Science; Engineering; Telecommunications,WB7Y0,,gold,,,8/15/24,WOS:001252485200001,,0,207,,,

A rapidly growing approach to reduce the costs of scientific equipment is to combine open-source hardware methods with digital distributed manufacturing with 3D printers. Although high-end 3D printers can manufacture vacuum components, again, the cost of access to tooling is economically prohibitive. Low-cost material extrusion 3D printing with plastic overcomes the cost issue, but two problems arise when attempting to use plastic in or as part of vacuum systems: the outgassing of polymers and their sealing. To overcome these challenges, this study explores the potential of using post-processing heat treatments to seal 3D printed polypropylene for use in vacuum environments. The effect of infill overlap and heat treatment with a readily available heat gun on 3D printed PP parts was investigated in detail on ISO-standardized KF vacuum fitting parts and with the use of computer vision-based monitoring of vacuum pump down velocities. The results showed that infill overlap and heat treatment both had a large impact on the vacuum pressures obtainable with 3D printed parts. Heat treatment combined with 98% infill reliably sealed parts for use in vacuum systems, which makes the use of low-cost desktop 3D printers viable for manufacturing vacuum components for open scientific hardware.","[Mayville, Pierce J.; Pearce, Joshua M.] Michigan Technol Univ, Dept Mat Sci & Engn, Houghton, MI 49931 USA; [Petsiuk, Aliaksei L.; Pearce, Joshua M.] Western Univ, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, London, ON N6A 5B9, Canada; [Pearce, Joshua M.] Western Univ, Ivey Business Sch, London, ON N6A 5B9, Canada",Michigan Technological University; Western University (University of Western Ontario); Western University (University of Western Ontario),"Pearce, JM (corresponding author), Michigan Technol Univ, Dept Mat Sci & Engn, Houghton, MI 49931 USA.; Pearce, JM (corresponding author), Western Univ, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, London, ON N6A 5B9, Canada.; Pearce, JM (corresponding author), Western Univ, Ivey Business Sch, London, ON N6A 5B9, Canada.",joshua.pearce@uwo.ca,"Pearce, Joshua/C-9240-2013","Pearce, Joshua/0000-0001-9802-3056",Thompson Endowment; Witte Endowment,Thompson Endowment; Witte Endowment,This work was supported by the Witte and Thompson Endowments.,,64,5,5,1,6,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2504-4494,,J MANUF MATER PROC,J.

The intended application is wide area electrical power system measurements, in particular phasor measurement units (PMUs). The novelty of the authors' design is the application of an open hardware development platform to discipline a commodity analog-to-digital converter (ADC) to a broadcast time signal, usually but not exclusively GPS. The methodology used creates a driver layer for the ADC to achieve real-time sampling in a nonpreemptive Linux environment. The use of open hardware and software addresses the need for a transparent instrument for use in research and development of PMU technology. Through a choice of either a software or hardware phase-locked loop, the ADC is controlled to acquire exactly 256 samples per nominal power system cycle (i. e., 50/60 Hz), precisely time synchronized to GPS, at 16-b resolution and 94.2-dB SNR. The design of a printed circuit board expansion board featuring all necessary components is provided. The performance of the system is evaluated.

This paper implements the printed circuit MEMS (PC-MEMS) process [1] for the fabrication of a 'pop-up' flexure-based mesoscale system that exploits the simplicity of 2-D manufacturing techniques such as sheet-metal operations and laser cutting to realize a 3-D mechanism. The fabrication of a laminated Delta robot with prismatic actuation is presented to exemplify this process. A working device with actuation and functional components such as linear guides, stepper motors and limit switches is designed and fully realized. Because the mechanism is popped out of the plane to achieve its 3D shape, we present a stiffness analysis to arrive at the out-of-plane (or 'pop-out') angles that the planar system must accommodate so that constraints/limits on actuator torque/force can be can satisfied while producing an operational system.

Traditional methods involve operator intervention with gravimetric analysis to monitor the gross accuracy of full plate dispenses, visual verification of contents, or dedicated weigh stations on screening platforms that introduce potential bottlenecks and increase the plate-processing cycle time. We present a unique solution using open-source hardware, software, and 3D printing to automate dispenser accuracy determination by providing real-time dispense weight measurements via a network-connected precision balance. This system uses an Arduino microcontroller to connect a precision balance to a local network. By integrating the precision balance as an Internet of Things (IoT) device, it gains the ability to provide real-time gravimetric summaries of dispensing, generate timely alerts when problems are detected, and capture historical dispensing data for future analysis. All collected data can then be accessed via a web interface for reviewing alerts and dispensing information in real time or remotely for timely intervention of dispense errors. The development of this system also leveraged 3D printing to rapidly prototype sensor brackets, mounting solutions, and component enclosures.","[Shumate, Justin; Baillargeon, Pierre; Spicer, Timothy P.; Scampavia, Louis] Scripps Florida, Scripps Res Inst, Mol Screening Ctr, 130 Scripps Way 1A1, Jupiter, FL 33458 USA; [Shumate, Justin; Baillargeon, Pierre; Spicer, Timothy P.; Scampavia, Louis] Scripps Florida, Dept Mol Med, 130 Scripps Way 1A1, Jupiter, FL 33458 USA",State University System of Florida; University of Florida; Herbert Wertheim UF Scripps Institute for Biomedical Innovation & Technology; State University System of Florida; University of Florida; Herbert Wertheim UF Scripps Institute for Biomedical Innovation & Technology,"Scampavia, L (corresponding author), Scripps Florida, Scripps Res Inst, Mol Screening Ctr, 130 Scripps Way 1A1, Jupiter, FL 33458 USA.; Scampavia, L (corresponding author), Scripps Florida, Dept Mol Med, 130 Scripps Way 1A1, Jupiter, FL 33458 USA.",scampl@scripps.edu,"Baillargeon, Pierre/C-3000-2018","Baillargeon, Pierre/0000-0003-4431-1372",,,,,14,13,13,0,13,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",2472-6303,2472-6311,,SLAS TECHNOL,SLAS Technol.,OCT,2018,23,5,,,SI,,440,447,,10.1177/2472630318769454,http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/2472630318769454,,,8,"Biochemical Research Methods; Chemistry, Analytical",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Biochemistry & Molecular Biology; Chemistry,GU4EU,29649373,hybrid,,,8/15/24,WOS:000445235700006,,0,213,,,

The dependability of the Internet of Things is critical because the services will be concerned with real life. However, the inexpensive hardware provides limited resources for communication. In this paper, we present exact all-terminal reliability of the wireless networks of which the number of links of each node is bounded. First, we analyze the all-terminal reliability of the regular wireless network, where any two nodes are connected by a wireless link consisting of a pair of radio modules. The reliability polynomial is derived from the Tutte polynomial that is the seminal work of the algebraic graph theory. Second, we analyze the all-terminal reliability of the wireless network including the random mesh network under the assumption that if the module fails, all radio links connected through a radio module are cut off. We consider both the fault of the communication module and the fading of the wireless channel in the indoor channel condition. For improving the reliability, we also propose a fault-tolerant method giving redundant radio modules into each node. We also analyze cost-effectiveness. We also calculate the mean-time-to-failure (MTTF) for wireless networks. We show that the random mesh network of which each node includes three or more the radio-broadcast modules is more dependable than any other regular network of which each node comprises four point-to-point modules if it is the connected graph in the static environment.","[Park, Jae-Hyun] Chung Ang Univ, Sch Comp Sci & Engn, Seoul 156756, South Korea",Chung Ang University,"Park, JH (corresponding author), Chung Ang Univ, Sch Comp Sci & Engn, Seoul 156756, South Korea.",hyunie@cau.ac.kr,"Park, Jae-Hyun/R-6013-2017","Park, Jae-Hyun/0000-0003-2616-9907",,,,,23,16,16,0,11,IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC,PISCATAWAY,"445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA",2327-4662,,,IEEE INTERNET THINGS,IEEE Internet Things J.,APR,2016,3,2,,,,,219,230,,10.1109/JIOT.2015.2496259,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/JIOT.2015.2496259,,,12,"Computer Science, Information Systems; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Telecommunications",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Computer Science; Engineering; Telecommunications,DH9XH,,,,,8/15/24,WOS:000373148800008,,0,214,,,

This can be achieved through the collection of high contrast, data rich, and insightful microstructural maps. Electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) has emerged as a popular tool available within the scanning electron microscope (SEM), where maps are realized through the repeat capture and analysis of Kikuchi diffraction patterns. Typical commercial EBSD systems require large and sophisticated detectors that are mounted on the side of the SEM vacuum chamber which can be limiting in terms of widespread access to the technique. In this work, we present an alternative open-hardware solution based upon a compact EBSD system with a simple, static geometry that uses an off-the-shelf direct electron detector co-mounted with a sample. This simple stage is easy to manufacture and improves our knowledge of the diffraction geometry significantly. Microscope and detector control is achieved through software application programming interface (API) integration. After pattern capture, analysis of the diffraction patterns is performed using open-source analysis within AstroEBSD. To demonstrate the potential of this set up, we present two simple EBSD experiments using a line scan and area mapping. We hope that the present system can inspire simpler EBSD system design for widespread access to the EBSD technique and promote the use of open-source software and hardware in the workflow of EBSD experiments.","[Zhang, Tianbi; Ben Britton, T.] Univ British Columbia, Dept Mat Engn, 309-6350 Stores Rd, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z4, Canada",University of British Columbia,"Ben Britton, T (corresponding author), Univ British Columbia, Dept Mat Engn, 309-6350 Stores Rd, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z4, Canada.",ben.britton@ubc.ca,,,,,,,43,0,0,3,3,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",0968-4328,1878-4291,,MICRON,Micron,MAR,2024,178,,,,,,,,103582,10.1016/j.micron.2023.103582,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.micron.2023.103582,,24-Jan,10,Microscopy,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Microscopy,HF0U2,38181589,Green Submitted,,,8/15/24,WOS:001157968600001,,0,215,,,

Short-term load forecasting models enable prediction of future power consumption, thereby encouraging shifting of loads and optimizing the use of stochastic power sources and stored energy. To make the electric grid system smart and sustainable, two-way communication between the utility and consumers must be set up and the working equipment must respond digitally to the quickly changing electric demand. The proposed work exploits the power of embedded systems to design a low-cost solution for interconnecting electrical and electronic devices, controlled by the intelligent Internet of Things (IoT) paradigms. This work primarily focuses on implementing standard regression and machine learning-based architectures for smart grid load analysis and forecasting. A state of the art ecosystem for a portable load forecasting device is proposed by means of low-cost, open-source hardware that is experimentally found to be functioning with a high degree of accuracy. Further, the performance of the classical and advanced machine learning models, emulated on the device, are analyzed on the basis of various parameters, including error percentage, execution time, CPU core temperatures, and resource utilization. Overall impressive performance is demonstrated by some specific machine learning models which are considered to be suitable for the proposed framework. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc.

One limitation of this model system is the lack of long-term storage for genetic resources. In this study, approaches for Hydractinia sperm cryopreservation were established for the first time. Open hardware and 3-D printing were used to facilitate animal husbandry, sperm handling, and cryopreservation. Hydractinia sperm at a concentration of 2 x 10(7) cells/mL stored at 4 degrees C for as long as 6 d were able to achieve 50% fertilization rate. A fertilization rate of 41-69% was observed using sperm equilibrated with 5, 10, or 15% (v/v) cryoprotectant (dimethyl sulfoxide or methanol) for 20 min, cooled at a rate of 5, 10, or 20 degrees C/min from 4 degrees C to -80 degrees C, at a cell concentration of 1 x 10(8) sperm/mL, in 0.25 mL French straws. Establishing repository capabilities for the Hydractinia research community will be essential for future development, maintenance, protection, and distribution of genetic resources. More broadly, these generalizable approaches can be used as a model to develop germplasm repositories for other cnidarian species. Hydractinia symbiolongicarpus is an emerging model organism in which cutting-edge genomic tools and resources are being developed for use in a growing number of research fields. One limitation of this model system is the lack of long-term storage for genetic resources. The goal of this study was to establish a generalizable cryopreservation approach for Hydractinia that would support future repository development for other cnidarian species. Specific objectives were to: (1) characterize basic parameters related to sperm quality; (2) develop a generalizable approach for sperm collection; (3) assess the feasibility of in vitro fertilization (IVF) with sperm after refrigerated storage; (4) assess the feasibility of IVF with sperm cryopreserved with various sperm concentrations; (5) evaluate feasibility of cryopreservation with various freezing conditions, and (6) explore the feasibility of cryopreservation by use of a 3-D printed open-hardware (CryoKit) device. Animal husbandry and sperm collection were facilitated by use of 3-D printed open hardware. Hydractinia sperm at a concentration of 2 x 10(7) cells/mL stored at 4 degrees C for 6 d were able to achieve 50% fertilization rate. It appeared that relatively higher sperm concentration (>5 x 10(7) cells/mL) for cryopreservation could promote fertilization. A fertilization rate of 41-69% was observed using sperm equilibrated with 5, 10, or 15% (v/v) cryoprotectant (dimethyl sulfoxide or methanol) for 20 min, cooled at a rate of 5, 10, or 20 degrees C/min from 4 degrees C to -80 degrees C, at a cell concentration of 10(8)/mL, in 0.25 mL French straws. Samples cryopreserved with the CryoKit produced a fertilization rate of 72-82%. Establishing repository capabilities for the Hydractinia research community will be essential for future development, maintenance, protection, and distribution of genetic resources.

The system is a three-channel temperature sensor that consists of two precision thermistors that measure the temperature in the core and the surface of a fruit on a tree and a Harsh Environment thermistor that measures the air temperature surrounding the host at a rate of one measurement per 15 min. The sample rate can be adjusted according to the researcher's needs. The system was successfully tested in field and laboratory experimental conditions using apples as the fruit model. The measurements on apples on trees lasted five consecutive days and produced a range of reliable data.

The increasing complexity of the control and estimation algorithms requires deeper functional testing and validation phases of BMSs. However, the use of real batteries in such phases leads to hazards and safety risks. Battery emulators and the Hardware-in-the-Loop approach can instead speed-up and increase the safety of the functional testing and algorithm validation phases. This work describes the design and the characterization of a low-cost modular multi-cell battery emulator which provides a complete emulation of cell voltage, temperature, and current. This platform can be used to carry out Hardware-in-the-Loop tests on custom and commercial Battery Management Systems. The paper describes the platform design constraints derived from the most diffused Battery Management System architectures, the main design and implementation choices, and the platform characterization results. The proposed emulation platform is compared with literature and commercial ones showing a very good trade-off between performance and cost. This characteristic makes it appealing for small-size laboratories that develop and test Battery Management Systems.

To ensure that a private network satisfies its own requirements and guarantees coverage, it is important to accurately measure the radio performance at the accurate position to further optimize the network. Additionally, as carrier frequencies increase, cellular network-based positioning becomes increasingly important, as it enables more accurate positioning. For example, centimeter-level accuracy is expected in beyond 5G systems owing to the sub-THz band carrier frequency. To accurately compare and assess various cellular network-based positioning methods, positioning devices, which can move along the same trajectory more accurately than at the centimeter-level, are required. To this end, we implemented a three-dimensional (3D) positioning device developed from open-source hardware, which is generally used to implement computer numerical control (CNC) machines and 3D printers. The implemented 3D pointing device is cost-effective and portable and can be freely configurable and resized in one, two, and three dimensions owing to the use of open-source hardware. The received signal strength indicator (RSSI) employing the LoRa module can be obtained using the implemented device. Using a very low carrier frequency system, it is possible to accurately measure the RSSI variations due to multipath propagation. After demonstrating the reproducibility of the data, the effectiveness of the implemented device was confirmed by showing that the RSSI variation and fading correlation coefficient are close to the Rayleigh fading variation.","[Makino, Issei; Miki, Nobuhiko] Kagawa Univ, Fac Engn & Design, Takamatsu, Kagawa 7610396, Japan",Kagawa University,"Miki, N (corresponding author), Kagawa Univ, Fac Engn & Design, Takamatsu, Kagawa 7610396, Japan.",miki.nobuhiko@kagawa-u.ac.jp,,,,,,,37,0,0,0,4,IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC,PISCATAWAY,"445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA",2169-3536,,,IEEE ACCESS,IEEE Access,,2023,11,,,,,,11254,11267,,10.1109/ACCESS.2023.3240192,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2023.3240192,,,14,"Computer Science, Information Systems; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Telecommunications",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Computer Science; Engineering; Telecommunications,9B7XO,,gold,,,8/15/24,WOS:000934946900001,,0,221,,,

This results in a device that can be considered as a black box, as it is difficult to determine the applied signal processing. This paper presents an open source low-cost active sEMG circuit, allowing an understanding of sEMG and the challenges involved in designing a high quality device. An open source sEMG design reduces the time and cost associated with initial sEMG research, providing a larger number of researchers with the opportunity to utilise sEMG. The device has been tested on three subjects, resulting in a low baseline noise <= 5.2 mu V-rms and great line noise rejection, resulting in a sensitive device that can capture high quality bio-potential signals.

A number of IoT-based home monitoring systems have been available, but most rely on privacy-intrusive cameras. With more and more concerns on privacy and security of human data, anomaly detection based on nonintrusive IoT devices becomes more desirable. Considering the elderly consumers, a low-cost system with good detection accuracy is further critical for the system's acceptability by elderly users. We propose a smart home monitoring system for living-alone senior citizens, relying on carefully designed, low-cost infrared sensor devices, as well as a cloud-based data processing and anomaly detection platform. Our PIR sensor device is effective in continuous monitoring of motion data in a user's apartment, and an open-hardware software platform is devised to support sensors manufactured by various vendors in the IoT system, all for cost reduction purpose. For privacy preservation, we encrypt collected data and store data indices in a blockchain system, to achieve efficient data access control and auditing. For motion anomaly detection, we propose a simple but effective environment adaptation method to work with the one-class support vector machine (OCSVM) method. Experiments driven by real-world traces show good reliability, accuracy, and efficiency of our system.","[Fang, Le; Wu, Chuan; Yu, Yizhou] Univ Hong Kong, Dept Comp Sci, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Wu, Yu] Southern Univ Sci & Technol, Inst Future Networks, Shenzhen 518055, Peoples R China; [Wu, Yu; Wu, Chuan] PCL Res Ctr Networks & Commun, Peng Cheng Lab, Shenzhen 518066, Peoples R China",University of Hong Kong; Southern University of Science & Technology; Peng Cheng Laboratory,"Wu, C (corresponding author), Univ Hong Kong, Dept Comp Sci, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.",lefang@connect.hku.hk; wuy7@sustech.edu.cn; cwu@cs.hku.hk; yzyu@cs.hku.hk,"Fang, Le/AAI-5592-2021; Fang, Le/IWD-9835-2023; Gopal, Suvetha/KFR-7088-2024; Wu, Chuan/E-9919-2010; /F-3345-2010","Fang, Le/0000-0003-1860-4008; Fang, Le/0000-0003-1860-4008; Wu, Chuan/0000-0002-3144-4398; /0000-0002-0470-5548","Hong Kong RGC [HKU 17204619, 17225516, C5026-18G]; Hong Kong ITF [ITS/305/19FP]; NSFC [61702098]; PCL Future Greater-Bay Area Network Facilities for Large-scale Experiments and Applications [LZC0019]",Hong Kong RGC(Hong Kong Research Grants Council); Hong Kong ITF; NSFC(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); PCL Future Greater-Bay Area Network Facilities for Large-scale Experiments and Applications,"This work was supported in part by the Hong Kong RGC under Contract HKU 17204619, Contract 17225516, and Contract C5026-18G (CRF); in part by the Hong Kong ITF under Grant ITS/305/19FP; in part by NSFC under Grant 61702098; and in part by the PCL Future Greater-Bay Area Network Facilities for Large-scale Experiments and Applications under Grant LZC0019.",,73,11,12,6,39,IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC,PISCATAWAY,"445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA",2327-4662,,,IEEE INTERNET THINGS,IEEE Internet Things J.,15-Feb,2021,8,4,,,,,2603,2614,,10.1109/JIOT.2020.3019270,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/JIOT.2020.3019270,,,12,"Computer Science, Information Systems; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Telecommunications",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Computer Science; Engineering; Telecommunications,QE6LK,,,,,8/15/24,WOS:000616317000039,,0,225,,,

Commercial programmable freezers are costly and thus unaffordable to many users. Self-made devices have substantial variability , resulting in few opportunities for standardization across communities. The development of open hardware with the increasing accessibility of three-dimensional (3-D) printing offers rapid prototyping and easy fabrication of devices by users around the world at low cost. The present study explored the feasibility of developing operational prototypes of 3-D printed motorized cryopreservation devices for continuous freezing of non-batched samples. A controlled cooling conveyor device (CCCD) was designed and fabricated to cryopreserve sperm samples in straws that were loaded onto chain links suspended over liquid nitrogen held in a Styrofoam box. Cooling rates of 5-34 degrees C/min for 0.5-mL French straws were produced by adjusting the height of conveyor chains, slopes, and liquid nitrogen mass. The plunge temperature (-47 degrees C to -61 degrees C) was controlled by adjustment of conveyor speed. The cooling curves from the CCCD were comparable to a commercial programmable freezer. There were no significant differences in post-thaw motility of sperm from ornamental (Koi) common carp (Cyprinus carpio) among samples frozen with the CCCD and those frozen with a commercial programmable freezer. The post-thaw sperm motility was consistent among samples frozen in the CCCD across a 15-min time span. The CCCD prototypes in the present study proved to be feasible and functional as low-cost, customizable, portable, and yet standardizable options for freezing of individual (non-batched) samples. Additional design alternatives are proposed to facilitate further adaptation and development by diverse user communities.","[Liu, Yue; Eskridge, Melissa; Beckham, Jacob; Chesnut, Megan; Monroe, William Todd] Louisiana State Univ, Dept Biol & Agr Engn, 163 EB Doran Bldg, Baton Rouge, LA 70803 USA; [Liu, Yue; Eskridge, Melissa; Beckham, Jacob; Chesnut, Megan; Monroe, William Todd] LSU Agr Ctr, Baton Rouge, LA 70803 USA; [Liu, Yue; Guitreau, Amy; Torres, Leticia; Tiersch, Terrence R.] Louisiana State Univ Agr Ctr, Aquat Germplasm & Genet Resources Ctr, Sch Renewable Nat Resources, Baton Rouge, LA 70820 USA",Louisiana State University System; Louisiana State University; Louisiana State University System; Louisiana State University; Louisiana State University System; Louisiana State University,"Monroe, WT (corresponding author), Louisiana State Univ, Dept Biol & Agr Engn, 163 EB Doran Bldg, Baton Rouge, LA 70803 USA.",tmonroe@lsu.edu,,,,,,,48,9,10,4,9,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0144-8609,1873-5614,,AQUACULT ENG,Aquac.

State-of-the-art microcontroller units provide a wide range of ultra-low-power inactive modes with sub-millisecond wakeup time that can be effectively used for this purpose. At the same time they are equipped with 16-bit RISC architectures clocked at tens of MHz, which make them powerful enough to run a Java-compatible virtual machine (VM). This makes it possible to bring the benefits of a virtual runtime environment into power-constrained embedded systems. VMs, however, risk to impair the effectiveness of dynamic power management as they are seen as always-active processes by the scheduler of the operating system in spite of the idleness of the threads running on top of them. Avoiding to keep sensor nodes busy when they could be idle is mandatory for the energetic sustainability of WSNs. While most of the tasks of a sensor node are inherently event-driven, the functioning of its hardware-software components is not, so that they require to be redesigned in order to exploit idleness.

The use of centrally-manufactured commercial tourniquets, however, is not always possible due to supply chain disruptions. The open-source hardware model has been applied to overcome these disruptions in humanitarian crises and several low-cost digitally manufacturable open-source tourniquets have been developed. With the low reliability of improvised tourniquets, it is important to ensure that distributed manufacturing of tourniquets is effective and safe. Tourniquets can be tested, but existing tourniquet testers are expensive, bulky, and complex to operate, which limits their accessibility to an even greater extent than tourniquets in extreme settings. This article fulfills a need by providing a small, transportable, open-source additive-manufactured tourniquet tester that enables inexpensive and accurate testing of tourniquets against known clinical parameters. The <$100 tourniquet tester is validated and tested for operating force of tourniquets in the field or in distributed manufacturing facilities. The tourniquet tester has a significant economic and operational advantage compared to proprietary counterparts available on the market. Once calibrated with a blood pressure monitor, the built-in LCD displays the measuring range of the tester as 0 to 200 N, which is enough to test the validation of all tourniquets.

The sensor is a first at a cost of less than USD 50, which is well suited to previously cost-prohibited high-resolution monitoring schemes. This use case is further supported by its out-of-water operation, which provides low-effort installations and longer maintenance-free intervals when compared with in-water sensors. The inclusion of both velocity and depth measurement capabilities allows the sensor to also be used as an all-in-one solution for flowrate measurement. We discuss the design of the sensor, which has been made freely available under open-hardware and open-source licenses. The design uses commonly available electronic components, and a 3D-printed casing makes the design easy to replicate and modify. Not before seen on a hydrology sensor, we include a 3D-printed radar lens in the casing, which boosts radar sensitivity by 21 dB. The velocity and depth-sensing performance were characterised in laboratory and in-field tests. The depth is accurate to within & PLUSMN;6% and & PLUSMN;7 mm and the uncertainty in the velocity measurements ranges from less than 30% to 36% in both laboratory and field conditions.

It requires the appropriate infrastructure for recognizing emotional states and reacting accordingly in runtime. In this paper, we describe the open platform that we have implemented (named AICARP v2) to detect changes in physiological signals that can be associated with stressful situations, and when this happens, it recommends the learner to relax by delivering modulated sensorial support in terms of light, sound, or vibration at a relaxation breath rate. In this way, by taking advantage of ambient intelligence, the learner can perceive the recommended action without interrupting the learning activity (in this case, practicing the oral exam of a second language). The signal acquisition of the system (which combines sensors from Libellium e-Health platform with others integrated ad hoc) has been compared with a commercial system (J&J Engineering I-330-C2), obtaining similar outcomes as to identifying significant changes in the physiological signals when the learner experiments an emotional reaction. However, the cost of AICARP v2 is much lower, and at the same time, it is open hardware and flexible and, thus, has the advantage of providing runtime data processing. User studies have served to evaluate participants' perception of the sensorial support, as well as to calibrate the delivery rule and to evaluate the effectiveness of the support provided to them.","[Santos, Olga C.; Uria-Rivas, Raul; Boticario, Jesus G.] UNED, Dept Artificial Intelligence, aDeNu Res Grp, Madrid 28040, Spain; [Rodriguez-Sanchez, M.

The feasibility of the measurement instrument was tested both in laboratory with a signal generator and in the Minerve reactor. It is shown that the instrument provides reliable and robust count rate estimation over a wide reactor power range based on the third order statistics of the fission chamber signal. In addition, the system is able to identify whether the measured count rate change is due to the malfunction of the detector or due to the change in the neutron flux. The applied self-monitoring method is based on the spectral properties of the fission chamber signal. During the experimental verification, the considered malfunction was the change of the polarization voltage. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

IEEE 754-2019 compliant (floating-point) arithmetic is the de facto standard for performing these computations. Recently, posit-arithmetic has been proposed as a drop-in replacement for floating-point arithmetic. The posit data representation and arithmetic claim several advantages over the floating-point format and arithmetic, including higher dynamic range, better accuracy, and superior performance-area trade-offs. However, very few accessible and holistic frameworks facilitate the validation of these claims of posit-arithmetic, especially with long accumulations (quire).We present a consolidated general-purpose processor-based framework to support posit-arithmetic empiri-cism. Users can seamlessly experiment using posit and floating-point arithmetic in their applications since the framework is designed for the two number systems to coexist. Melodica is a posit-arithmetic core that implements parametric fused operations on the quire data type. Clarinet is a Melodica-enabled processor based on the RISC-V ISA. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first-ever integration of the quire in a RISC-V core.

Yet, global plastics production has quadrupled in 40 years and only 9 % has been recycled. If these trends continue, carbon emis-sions from plastic wastes would reach 15 % of global carbon budgets by 2050. An approach to reducing plastic waste is to use distributed recycling for additive manufacturing (DRAM) where virgin plastic products are replaced by locally manufactured recycled plastic products that have no transportation-related carbon emissions. Unfortunately, the design of most 3-D printers forces an increase in the machine cost to expand for recycling plastic at scale. Recently, a fused granular fabrication (FGF)/fused particle fabrication (FPF) large-scale prin-ter was demonstrated with a GigabotX extruder based on the open source cable driven Hangprinter concept. To further improve that system, here a lower-cost recyclebot direct waste plastic extruder is demonstrated and the full designs, assembly and operation are detailed. The <$1,700 machine's accuracy and printing performance are quantified, and the printed parts mechanical strength is within the range of other systems. Along with sup-port from the Hangprinter and DUET3 communities, open hardware developers have a rich ecosystem to modify in order to print directly from waste plastic for DRAM.(c) 2023 The Author(s).

Drifters have the potential of facilitating the monitoring and modeling of river behavior at a fraction of traditional monitoring costs. They are floating objects equipped with sensors able to passively follow the movements of water. During their travel, they collect and transmit information about their movement and their surrounding environment. In this paper, we present and assess a low-cost (<150 EUR) customizable drifter developed with off-the-shelf components. The open drifter is capable of handling the majority of use cases defined in the specialized literature and in addition it offers a general river flow characterization toolkit. One of the main goals of this work is to establish an open hardware and software basis to increase the use of drifters in river studies. Results show that the proposed drifter provides reliable surface velocity estimates when compared to a commercial flow meter, offering a lower cost per data point and in contrast to traditional point measurements it can be used to identify and classify large-scale surface flow patterns. The diverse sensor payload of the open drifter presented in this work makes it a new and unique tool for autonomous river characterization.","[Francisco Fuentes-Perez, Juan; Javier Sanz-Ronda, Francisco] Univ Valladolid, GEA Ecohydraul, Dept Agr & Forestry Engn, Campus La Yutera,Ave Madrid 44, Palencia 34004, Spain; [Francisco Fuentes-Perez, Juan] Itagra Ct, Ctr Tecnol Agrario & Agroalimentario, Campus La Yutera,Ave Madrid 44, Palencia 34004, Spain; [Tuhtan, Jeffrey A.] Tallinn Univ Technol, Sch Informat Technol, Dept Comp Syst, EE-12616 Tallinn, Estonia",Universidad de Valladolid; Tallinn University of Technology,"Fuentes-P√©rez, JF (corresponding author), Univ Valladolid, GEA Ecohydraul, Dept Agr & Forestry Engn, Campus La Yutera,Ave Madrid 44, Palencia 34004, Spain.; Fuentes-P√©rez, JF (corresponding author), Itagra Ct, Ctr Tecnol Agrario & Agroalimentario, Campus La Yutera,Ave Madrid 44, Palencia 34004, Spain.",juanfrancisco.fuentes@uva.es,"Sanz-Ronda, Francisco Javier/E-9087-2016; Fuentes-Perez, Juan Francisco/N-3312-2015; Tuhtan, Jeffrey/E-1601-2011","Sanz-Ronda, Francisco Javier/0000-0003-4566-9499; Fuentes-Perez, Juan Francisco/0000-0003-2384-9085; Tuhtan, Jeffrey/0000-0003-0832-7334",European Union [LIFE18 NAT/ES/000121]; European Research Council (ERC) under the European Union [101032024]; EXCITE; Estonian Centre of Excellence in IT - European Regional Development Fund [2014-2020.4.01.15-0018]; European Economic Area (EEA) [EMP480]; Marie Curie Actions (MSCA) [101032024] Funding Source: Marie Curie Actions (MSCA),European Union(European Union (EU)); European Research Council (ERC) under the European Union(European Research Council (ERC)); EXCITE; Estonian Centre of Excellence in IT - European Regional Development Fund; European Economic Area (EEA); Marie Curie Actions (MSCA)(Marie Curie Actions),"The research leading to these results has received funding from the European Union's LIFE program under agreement No. LIFE18 NAT/ES/000121 (Life DivAqua).

It is usually measured using expensive laboratory equipment. This method, which gives information about the material, is also used quite a lot in medical applications. However, laboratory equipment used in this measurement is often costly. Low-cost laboratory equipment for data acquisition with open-source hardware and software is a lifesaver for the low-budget research projects. Although there are many data acquisition hardware and software in the market, most of them are complex and expensive. They contain many extra features other than some specific ones required for transmission rate measurement. In this study, X-ray transmission rate measurement of some chemical compounds was carried out using a low-cost laboratory counter and data acquisition software. The results are shown by experiments and are consistent with the catalogue values of the materials and chemical compounds used. Thus, in this paper a method is proposed for both measuring the thickness of the material with known linear attenuation coefficient and measuring the linear attenuation coefficient for a material with known thickness.","[Zengin, Aydin Tarik] Istanbul Sabahattin Zaim Univ, Fac Engn, Comp Sci Dept, Halkali Cad 2, TR-34303 Istanbul, Turkey",Istanbul Sabahattin Zaim University,"Zengin, AT (corresponding author), Istanbul Sabahattin Zaim Univ, Fac Engn, Comp Sci Dept, Halkali Cad 2, TR-34303 Istanbul, Turkey.",tarik.zengin@izu.edu.tr,"ZENGIN, AYDIN TARIK/ABF-8916-2020","ZENGIN, AYDIN TARIK/0000-0002-0860-4509",,,,,42,0,0,0,3,TAYLORS UNIV SDN BHD,SELANGOR,"1 JALAN SS15-8, SUBANG JAYA, SELANGOR, 47500, MALAYSIA",,1823-4690,,J ENG SCI TECHNOL,J.

This ability requires the nervous system to undergo adjustments at distinct temporal scales, from short-term dynamic changes in expression of neurotransmitters and receptors to longer-term growth, spatial and connectivity reorganization, while integrating external stimuli. The nematode Caenorhabditis elegans provides a model of nervous system plasticity, in particular its dauer exit decision. Under unfavorable conditions, larvae will enter the non-feeding and non-reproductive stress-resistant dauer stage and adapt their behavior to cope with the harsh new environment, with active reversal under improved conditions leading to resumption of reproductive development. However, how different environmental stimuli regulate the exit decision mechanism and thereby drive the larva's behavioral change is unknown. To fill this gap and provide insights on behavioral changes over extended periods of time, we developed a new open hardware method for long-term imaging (12h) of C. elegans larvae.Results: Our WormObserver platform comprises open hardware and software components for video acquisition, automated processing of large image data (> 80k images/experiment) and data analysis. We identified dauer-specific behavioral motifs and characterized the behavioral trajectory of dauer exit in different environments and genetic backgrounds to identify key decision points and stimuli promoting dauer exit. Combining long-term behavioral imaging with transcriptomics data, we find that bacterial ingestion triggers a change in neuropeptide gene expression to establish post-dauer behavior.Conclusions: Taken together, we show how a developing nervous system can robustly integrate environmental changes activate a developmental switch and adapt the organism's behavior to a new environment. WormObserver is generally applicable to other research questions within and beyond the C. elegans field, having a modular and customizable character and allowing assessment of behavioral plasticity over longer periods.","[Preusser, Friedrich; Neuschulz, Anika; Junker, Jan Philipp; Rajewsky, Nikolaus] Max Delbruck Ctr Mol Med Helmholtz Assoc MDC, Berlin Inst Med Syst Biol BIMSB, D-10115 Berlin, Germany; [Preusser, Friedrich; Neuschulz, Anika] Humboldt Univ, Inst Biol, D-10099 Berlin, Germany; [Preibisch, Stephan] Howard Hughes Med Inst, Janelia Res Campus, Ashburn, VA 20147 USA",Helmholtz Association; Max Delbruck Center for Molecular Medicine; Humboldt University of Berlin; Howard Hughes Medical Institute,"Preusser, F (corresponding author), Humboldt Univ, Inst Biol, D-10099 Berlin, Germany.; Preibisch, S (corresponding author), Howard Hughes Med Inst, Janelia Res Campus, Ashburn, VA 20147 USA.",flpreusser@gmail.com; preibischs@janelia.hhmi.org,"Neuschulz, Anika/KWU-7581-2024; Junker, Jan Philipp/A-9754-2010","Neuschulz, Anika/0000-0001-6163-3344; Preibisch, Stephan/0000-0002-0276-494X; Preusser, Friedrich/0000-0001-8231-2195; Junker, Jan Philipp/0000-0002-2826-8290",HFSP; Studienstiftung des deutschen Volkes; MDC-Berlin; ERC starting grant SPACEVAR; HHMI Janelia;  [RGP0021/2018-102],HFSP(Human Frontier Science Program); Studienstiftung des deutschen Volkes; MDC-Berlin; ERC starting grant SPACEVAR(European Research Council (ERC)); HHMI Janelia;,F.P. was funded by a PhD fellowship from Studienstiftung des deutschen Volkes and MDC-Berlin.

This smart meter significantly improves the capabilities of the single-phase version, and overcomes certain shortcomings of other commercial devices, both in terms of versatility and data acquisition and processing capabilities. The system has been calibrated and validated using laboratory testing set-up and real-world applications, such as long-term photovoltaic power plant metering.

Here, we propose detectability of scale-freeness as a benchmark to evaluate time-series extraction settings. Scale-freeness, i.e., power-law distribution of node connections, is a fundamental topological property that is highly conserved across biological networks, and as such needs to be manifest within plausible reconstructions of brain connectivity.

It can be deployed as a testbed for depth controllers, as well as a mobile sensor platform for research or in industrial tanks. We introduce a control law that is based on the feedback linearization method and enhanced by an adaptive fuzzy algorithm to cope with modeling inaccuracies. The proposed depth controller is computationally light enough to run on ADAs embedded hardware. In experiments performed in a wave tank, the adaptive fuzzy scheme shows the ability to deal with both depth regulation and depth profile tracking. ADA is even able to hold on to dynamic isobars despite external disturbances. We demonstrate that under the influence of waves, ADA describes orbital motions similar to water particles.","[Bessa, Wallace M.; Kreuzer, Edwin; Lange, Johann; Pick, Marc-Andre; Solowjow, Eugen] Hamburg Univ Technol, Inst Mech & Ocean Engn, D-21073 Hamburg, Germany",Hamburg University of Technology,"Solowjow, E (corresponding author), Hamburg Univ Technol, Inst Mech & Ocean Engn, D-21073 Hamburg, Germany.",wmbessa@ct.ufrn.br; kreuzer@tuhh.de; johann.lange@tuhh.de; pick@tuhh.de; eugen.solowjow@tuhh.de,"Christensen, Johann Maximilian/JZE-2888-2024; Vasilescu, Iuliu/AAD-8067-2020; Bessa, Wallace Moreira/F-7708-2011","Bessa, Wallace Moreira/0000-0002-0935-7730; Christensen, Johann Maximilian/0000-0001-9871-122X",German Research Foundation [Kr 752/33-1]; Alexander von Humboldt Foundation; Brazilian Coordination for the Improvement of Higher Education Personnel,German Research Foundation(German Research Foundation (DFG)); Alexander von Humboldt Foundation(Alexander von Humboldt Foundation); Brazilian Coordination for the Improvement of Higher Education Personnel,This work was supported by the German Research Foundation under Grant Kr 752/33-1.

The use of Autonomous surface vehicles (ASV) have a promising role to revolutionize the transportation, monitorization, operation and maintenance areas, allowing to perform distinct task from offshore assets inspection to harbor patrolling. This work presents SENSE, an autonomouS vEssel for multi-domaiN inSpection and maintEnance. It provides an open-source hardware and software architecture that is easy to replicate for both research institutes and industry. This is a multi-purpose vehicle capable of acquiring multi-domain data for inspecting and reconstructing maritime infrastructures. SENSE provides a research platform which can increase the situational awareness capabilities for ASVs. SENSE full configuration provides multimodal sensory data acquired from both domains using a Light Detection And Ranging (LiDAR), a stereoscopic camera, and a multibeam echosounder. In addition, it supplies navigation information obtained from a real-time kinematic satellite navigation system and inertial measurement units. Moreover, the tests performed at the harbor of Marina de Leca, at Porto, Portugal, resulted in a dataset which captures a fully operational harbor. It illustrates several conditions on maritime scenarios, such as undocking and docking examples, crossings with other vehicles and distinct types of moored vessels. The data available represents both domains of the maritime scenario, being the first public dataset acquired for multi-domain observation using a single vehicle. This paper also provides examples of applications for navigation and inspection on multi-domain scenarios, such as odometry estimation, bathymetric surveying and multi-domain mapping.","[Campos, Daniel Filipe] Univ Porto, Fac Engn, P-4200465 Porto, Portugal; INESC TEC, Ctr Robot & Autonomous Syst, P-4200465 Porto, Portugal",Universidade do Porto; INESC TEC,"Campos, DF (corresponding author), Univ Porto, Fac Engn, P-4200465 Porto, Portugal.",daniel.f.campos@inesctec.pt,"Matos, Anibal/N-4350-2013","Matos, Anibal/0000-0002-9771-002X; Pinto, Andry Maykol Gomes/0000-0003-2465-5813; Campos, Daniel/0000-0002-3982-1856",Portuguese Government through the FCT-Foundation for Science and Technology [SFRH-BD-144263-2019]; ERDF-European Regional Development Fund through the Operational Program for Competitiveness and Internationalization-COMPETE 2020 Program; FCT [POCI-01-0145-FEDER-030010]; European Union [871571],Portuguese Government through the FCT-Foundation for Science and Technology(Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia (FCT)); ERDF-European Regional Development Fund through the Operational Program for Competitiveness and Internationalization-COMPETE 2020 Program; FCT(Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia (FCT)); European Union(European Union (EU)),"This work was supported in part by the Portuguese Government through the FCT~Foundation for Science and Technology within the Ph.D. Studentship to DC SFRH-BD-144263-2019, in part by the ERDF-European Regional Development Fund through the Operational Program for Competitiveness and Internationalization-COMPETE 2020 Program and FCT within Project POCI-01-0145-FEDER-030010 (DIIUS), and in part by the European Union's Horizon 2020-The EU Framework Program for Research and Innovation 2014~2020 under Grant 871571 (ATLANTIS).",,58,6,7,4,9,IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC,PISCATAWAY,"445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA",2169-3536,,,IEEE ACCESS,IEEE Access,,2022,10,,,,,,113355,113375,,10.1109/ACCESS.2022.3217504,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2022.3217504,,,21,"Computer Science, Information Systems; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Telecommunications",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Computer Science; Engineering; Telecommunications,5Y0RO,,gold,,,8/15/24,WOS:000878999500001,,0,242,,,

Not only does soil moisture represent the water available for plant growth but also water table levels can affect crop productivity. Furthermore, monitoring soil saturation and water table levels is essential for an early warning of extreme rainfall situations. However, the measurement of these parameters employing commercial instruments has certain disadvantages, with a high cost of purchase and maintenance. In addition, the handling of commercial devices makes it difficult to adapt them to the specific requirements of farmers or decision-makers. Open-source IoT hardware platforms are emerging as an attractive alternative to developing flexible and low-cost devices. This paper describes the design of a datalogger device based on open-source hardware platforms to register water table levels and soil moisture data for agronomic applications. The paper begins by describing energy-saving and wireless transmission techniques. Then, it summarizes the linear calibration of the phreatimeter sensor obtained with laboratory and field data. Finally, it shows how non-linear machine-learning techniques improve predictions over classical tools for the moisture sensor (SKU: SEN0193).","[Lopez, Emiliano; Vionnet, Carlos; Contini, Guillermo; Prodolliet, Jorge] Univ Nacl Litoral, Engn & Water Sci Dept, RA-3000 Santa Fe, Argentina; [Vionnet, Carlos] Natl Council Sci & Tech Res, RA-3000 Santa Fe, Argentina; [Ferrer-Cid, Pau; Barcelo-Ordinas, Jose M.; Garcia-Vidal, Jorge] Univ Politecn Cataluna, Comp Architecture Dept, Barcelona 08034, Spain; [Maiztegui, Jose] Univ Nacl Litoral, Agr Sci Dept, RA-3080 Esperanza S, Argentina",National University of the Littoral; Universitat Politecnica de Catalunya; National University of the Littoral,"L√≥pez, E (corresponding author), Univ Nacl Litoral, Engn & Water Sci Dept, RA-3000 Santa Fe, Argentina.",elopez@fich.unl.edu.ar,"Barcelo-Ordinas, Jose M./HTP-1068-2023","Barcelo-Ordinas, Jose M./0000-0002-9738-2425; Ferrer-Cid, Pau/0000-0003-2112-8516; Lopez, Emiliano/0000-0001-9218-1846; Vionnet, Carlos/0000-0002-6708-2624; Prodolliet, Jorge Adrian/0000-0001-9162-0624","Universidad Nacional del Litoral [CAID 50520190100249LI, CAAT 03012020]; Secretaria d'Universitats i Recerca de la Generalitat de Catalunya i del Fons Social Europeu [PID2019-107910RB-I00, 2017SGR-990]",Universidad Nacional del Litoral; Secretaria d'Universitats i Recerca de la Generalitat de Catalunya i del Fons Social Europeu,"This work is supported by Universidad Nacional del Litoral, research grants CAID 50520190100249LI and CAAT 03012020, and the National Spanish funding PID2019-107910RB-I00, by regional project 2017SGR-990, and with the support of Secretaria d'Universitats i Recerca de la Generalitat de Catalunya i del Fons Social Europeu.",,39,3,3,3,12,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,1424-8220,,SENSORS-BASEL,Sensors,SEP,2022,22,18,,,,,,,6840,10.3390/s22186840,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/s22186840,,,23,"Chemistry, Analytical; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Instruments & Instrumentation",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Chemistry; Engineering; Instruments & Instrumentation,4R9GF,36146185,"Green Published, gold",,,8/15/24,WOS:000857062300001,,0,243,,,

This prototype device employs 18 unique angular measurement positions and a variety of user-selectable LED light sources. The motivation for this project was the need to generate more parameter-rich data sets pertaining to the light-scattering properties of natural sediment suspensions, and to address the issues raised by Kitchener et al. (2017) concerning the inconsistent calibration methodologies currently employed to quantify suspended sediment concentration (SSC) by optical turbidity measurement. The mechanical design comprises re-purposed waste plastic materials and 3D-printed parts. The active light-source control and monitoring hardware and firmware executes on the open-source Arduino embedded microcontroller platform. The modular light sensors plug into any of the angular measurement positions, providing a 0-5 V nominal output signal, which is readable by the user's choice of data-acquisition system. The device will facilitate the highly detailed characterization of suspended sediment samples, providing 18 voltage output channels for analysis by the user. The precise calibration of the light sensors is by the use of neutral density (ND) filters in conjunction with light-source electrical current measurements, providing light-source intensity values as required. The empirical data provided by existing turbidity meters are acquired using incommensurate methodologies, and therefore they are not cross-comparable. A new methodology, described here, facilitates the cross-comparability of turbidity measurements. (C) 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.","[Kitchener, Ben G.

In this context, affordable precision instruments can play a significant role in the optimization of crops in developing countries where precision agriculture tools are barely available. In this work, a simple to use, cost-effective instrument for spectral analysis of plants and fruits based on open-source hardware and software has been developed. The instrument is a 7-band spectrophotometer equipped with a microprocessor that allows one to acquire the reflectance spectrum of samples and compute up to 9 vegetation indices. The accuracy in reflectance measurements is between 0.4% and 1.4% full scale, just above that of high-end spectrophotometers, while the precision at determining the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) is 0.61%, between 3 and 6 times better than more expensive commercial instruments. Some use cases of this instrument have been tested, and the prototype has proven to be able to precisely monitor minute spectral changes of different plants and fruits under different conditions, most of them before they were perceptible to the bare eye. This kind of information is essential in the decision-making process regarding harvesting, watering, or pest control, allowing precise control of crops. Given the low cost (less than USD 100) and open-source architecture of this instrument, it is an affordable tool to bring precision agriculture techniques to small farmers in developing countries.","[Javier Fernandez-Alonso, Francisco; Torres-Costa, Vicente] Autonomous Univ Madrid, Appl Phys Dept, Madrid 28049, Spain; [Javier Fernandez-Alonso, Francisco; Torres-Costa, Vicente] Autonomous Univ Madrid, Nicolas Cabrera Univ Inst Mat Sci, Madrid 28049, Spain; [Hernandez, Zulimar; Torres-Costa, Vicente] Autonomous Univ Madrid, Copernicus UAM Remote Sensing Lab, Madrid 28049, Spain",Autonomous University of Madrid; Autonomous University of Madrid; Autonomous University of Madrid,"Torres-Costa, V (corresponding author), Autonomous Univ Madrid, Appl Phys Dept, Madrid 28049, Spain.; Torres-Costa, V (corresponding author), Autonomous Univ Madrid, Nicolas Cabrera Univ Inst Mat Sci, Madrid 28049, Spain.; Torres-Costa, V (corresponding author), Autonomous Univ Madrid, Copernicus UAM Remote Sensing Lab, Madrid 28049, Spain.",franciscoj.fernandez05@estudiante.uam.es; zulimar.hernandez@uam.es; vicente.torres@uam.es,"Fernandez Alonso, Francisco Javier/KHC-3807-2024; Torres-Costa, Vicente/L-2379-2013","HERNANDEZ HERNANDEZ, ZULIMAR/0000-0002-7790-8397; Torres-Costa, Vicente/0000-0001-5066-2799; Fernandez Alonso, Francisco Javier/0000-0002-7943-9328","Comunidad de Madrid, Spain within the framework of Universidad Autonoma de Madrid, Spain","Comunidad de Madrid, Spain within the framework of Universidad Autonoma de Madrid, Spain","This work was funded by the Comunidad de Madrid, Spain, within the framework of the agreement with the Universidad Autonoma de Madrid, Spain in item ""Excellence of University Professorate"".",,59,1,1,2,7,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2077-0472,,AGRICULTURE-BASEL,Agriculture-Basel,AUG,2023,13,8,,,,,,,1467,10.3390/agriculture13081467,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/agriculture13081467,,,18,Agronomy,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Agriculture,Q5BY6,,"gold, Green Published",,,8/15/24,WOS:001057683300001,,0,245,,,

Ball milling advantages include the potential for high capacity, pre-dicted fineness in a specific amount of time, reliability, safety, and simplicity, but has dis-advantages of high weight, energy consumption and costs, which limit accessibility. To overcome these limitations this study applies the free and open source hardware approach coupled to distributed digital manufacturing to fabricate a ball mill with a simple, cus-tomizable design that can be used in a wide range of scientific applications and circum-stances including those without access to reliable grid electricity. The highly -customizable design reduces the cost to 130 for an AC powered version and 315 for a switchable power that enables off-grid operation with a solar module and bat-tery. Using a solar photovoltaic energy source not only improves the power reliability, but also makes it easier to move the ball mill for use in field environments.

However, since commercially available instruments are limited to droplet manipulation, our work addresses the need for accelerated integration of other components, such as temperature control, that can expand the application domain. Methods: We developed PhageBox-an accessible device that can be used as a biochip extension. At hardware level, PhageBox integrates temperature and electromagnetic control modules. At software level, PhageBox is controlled by embedded software containing a unique model for bio-protocol programming, and a graphical user interface for visual device feedback and operation. Results: To evaluate PhageBox's efficacy for biomedical applications, we performed functional testing. Similarly, we validated the temperature control using thermography, obtaining a range of +/- 0.2 C-degrees . The electromagnets produced a magnetic force of 15 milliTesla, demonstrating precise immobilization of magnetic beads. We show the potential of PhageBox for bacteriophage research through three initial protocols: a universal framework for PCR, T7 bacteriophage restriction enzyme digestion, and concentrating phi X174 RF genomic DNA. Conclusion: Our work presents an open-source hardware and software extension for digital microfluidics devices. This extension integrates temperature and electromagnetic modules, demonstrating efficacy in biomedical applications and potential for bacteriophage research. Significance: We developed PhageBox to be accessible: the components are off-the-shelf at a low cost ( <= $200), and the hardware designs and software code are open-source.

Nonetheless, the costs and issues regarding their implementation and deployment limit the access of the students and educators to their advantages and features such as technical and educational. In this line, this study describes a fully open-source remote laboratory in hardware and software for education in automatic control systems employing Raspberry Pi and Python language with an approximate cost of USD 461. Even, by changing some components, the cost can be reduced to USD 420 or less. To illustrate the functionalities of the labora-tory, we proposed a low-cost tank control system with its respective instrumentation, sig-nal conditioning, identification, and control, which are exposed in this document. However, other experiments can be easily scalable and adaptable to the remote laboratory. Concerning the interface of the laboratory, we designed a complete user-friendly web interface with real-time video for the users to perform the different activities in automatic control such as identification or controller implementation through the programming lan-guage Python. The instructions to build and replicate the hardware and software are indi-cated in the open repositories provided for the project as well as in this paper. Our intention with this project is to offer a complete low-cost and open-source remote labora-tory that can be adapted and used for the students, educators, and stakeholders to learn, experiment, and teach in the field of automatic control systems.

A better understanding of the mechanical properties of 3-D printing thermoplastics at cryogenic temperatures is essential to material selection, part design, and printing optimization. The goal of the present study was to explore the feasibility of development for a 3-D printed device ('CryoTensileDevice') to hold a test specimen in liquid nitrogen and be mounted in standard mechanical testing systems to evaluate 3-D printing material behaviors at cryogenic temperatures. The CryoTensileDevice was prototyped with flexible filaments with a per-unit material cost of <US$5 and a printing time of 5 h. The commonly used printing filament polylactic acid (PLA) was selected to evaluate the utility of the CryoTensileDevice. At room temperature, the CryoTensileDevice did not significantly (P 0.05) affect PLA tensile measurements such as Young's modulus, yield stress, yield strain, stress at break, or strain at break. With the CryoTensileDevice, specimens 3-D printed with PLA at 50%, 75%, and 100% infill rates had comparable tensile properties when tested at room and liquid nitrogen temperatures. The PLA showed superior performance in tensile properties in comparison to acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS). This device can assist characterization of 3-D printing approaches for cryogenic work, and opens a pathway for future innovations to create a variety of 3-D printed devices to study a wide range of material properties for cryogenic applications.","[Liu, Yue; Monroe, William T.] Louisiana State Univ, Dept Biol & Agr Engn, 163 EB Doran Bldg, Baton Rouge, LA 70803 USA; [Dong, Ju; Tiersch, Terrence R.; Wu, Qinglin] Louisiana State Univ, Sch Renewable Nat Resources, Agr Ctr, Baton Rouge, LA 70803 USA; [Tiersch, Terrence R.] Louisiana State Univ, Aquat Germplasm & Genet Resources Ctr, Sch Renewable Nat Resources, Agr Ctr, Baton Rouge, LA 70820 USA",Louisiana State University System; Louisiana State University; Louisiana State University System; Louisiana State University; Louisiana State University System; Louisiana State University,"Monroe, WT (corresponding author), Louisiana State Univ, Dept Biol & Agr Engn, 163 EB Doran Bldg, Baton Rouge, LA 70803 USA.",tmonroe@lsu.edu,"Wu, Qing-Lin/A-2727-2015",,"National Institutes of Health, Office of Research Infrastructure Programs [R24OD010441, R24-OD028443]; National Institute of Food and Agriculture, United States Department of Agriculture [LAB94420, NC1194]; Louisiana State University Research & Technology Foundation [AG-2018-LIFT003]; LSU-ACRES (Audubon Center for Research of Endangered Species) Collaborative Program; NIH Office of the Director [R24OD028443] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER","National Institutes of Health, Office of Research Infrastructure Programs; National Institute of Food and Agriculture, United States Department of Agriculture(United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)); Louisiana State University Research & Technology Foundation; LSU-ACRES (Audubon Center for Research of Endangered Species) Collaborative Program; NIH Office of the Director(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH Office of the Director)","This work was supported in part by funding from the National Institutes of Health, Office of Research Infrastructure Programs (R24OD010441 and R24-OD028443), with additional support provided by the National Institute of Food and Agriculture, United States Department of Agriculture (Hatch project LAB94420 and NC1194), the Louisiana State University Research & Technology Foundation (AG-2018-LIFT003), and the LSU-ACRES (Audubon Center for Research of Endangered Species) Collaborative Program.",,31,6,7,1,8,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0011-2275,1879-2235,,CRYOGENICS,Cryogenics,JAN,2022,121,,,,,,,,103409,10.1016/j.cryogenics.2021.103409,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cryogenics.2021.103409,,21-Dec,8,"Thermodynamics; Physics, Applied",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Thermodynamics; Physics,XU6UV,36779016,"Bronze, Green Accepted",,,8/15/24,WOS:000734398100003,,0,253,,,

The authors are focusing on a new symmetrical robot which can be used to rehabilitate the right upper limb and the left upper limb. The robotic arm can be automatically extended or reduced depending on the measurements of the patient's arm. The main idea is to integrate electrical stimulation into motor rehabilitation by robot. The goal is to provide automatic electrical stimulation based on muscle status during the rehabilitation process. Design/methodology/approach The developed robotic arm can be automatically extended or reduced depending on the measurements of the patient's arm. The system merges two rehabilitation strategies: motor rehabilitation and electrical stimulation. The goal is to take the advantages of both approaches. Electrical stimulation is often used for building muscle through endurance, resistance and strength exercises. However, in the proposed approach the electrical stimulation is used for recovery, relaxation and pain relief. In addition, the device includes an electromyography (EMG) muscle sensor that records muscle activity in real time. The control architecture provides the ability to automatically activate the appropriate stimulation mode based on the acquired EMG signal. The system software provides two modes for stimulation activation: the manual preset mode and the EMG driven mode. The program ensures traceability and provides the ability to issue a patient status monitoring report. Findings The developed robotic device is symmetrical and reconfigurable. The presented rehabilitation system includes a muscle stimulator associated with the robot to improve the quality of the rehabilitation process. The integration of neuromuscular electrical stimulation into the physical rehabilitation process offers effective rehabilitation sessions for neuromuscular recovery of the upper limb. A laboratory-made stimulator is developed to generate three modes of stimulation: pain relief, massage and relaxation. Through the control software interface, the physiotherapist can set the exercise movement parameters, define the stimulation mode and record the patient training in real time. Research limitations/implications There are certain constraints when applying the proposed method, such as the sensitivity of the acquired EMG signals. This involves the use of professional equipment and mainly the implementation of sophisticated algorithms for signal extraction. Practical implications Functional electrical stimulation and robot-based motor rehabilitation are the most important technologies applied in post-stroke rehabilitation. The main objective of integrating robots into the rehabilitation process is to compensate for the functions lost in people with physical disabilities. The stimulation technique can be used for recovery, relaxation and drainage and pain relief. In this context, the idea is to integrate electrical stimulation into motor rehabilitation based on a robot to obtain the advantages of the two approaches to further improve the rehabilitation process. The introduction of this type of robot also makes it possible to develop new exciting assistance devices. Originality/value The proposed design is symmetrical, reconfigurable and light, covering all the joints of the upper limbs and their movements. In addition, the developed platform is inexpensive and a portable solution based on open source hardware platforms which opens the way to more extensions and developments. Electrical stimulation is often used to improve motor function and restore loss of function. However, the main objective behind the proposed stimulation in this paper is to recover after effort. The novelty of the proposed solution is to integrate the electrical stimulation powered by EMG in robotic rehabilitation.","[Bouteraa, Yassine; Elmogy, Ahmed] Prince Sattam bin Abdulaziz Univ, Al Kharj, Saudi Arabia; [Bouteraa, Yassine] ENIS, CEM Lab, Sfax, Tunisia; [Bouteraa, Yassine] Univ Sfax, Digital Res Ctr Sfax, Sfax, Tunisia; [Ben Abdallah, Ismail] Natl Sch Engineers Sfax ENIS, Control & Energy Management Lab CEM Lab, Sfax, Tunisia; [Ben Abdallah, Ismail] Digital Res Ctr Sfax, Sfax, Tunisia; [Elmogy, Ahmed] Tanta Univ, Fac Engn, Tanta, Egypt",Prince Sattam Bin Abdulaziz University; Universite de Sfax; Ecole Nationale dIngenieurs de Sfax (ENIS); Universite de Sfax; Centre de Recherche en Numerique de Sfax (CRNS); Universite de Sfax; Ecole Nationale dIngenieurs de Sfax (ENIS); Centre de Recherche en Numerique de Sfax (CRNS); Universite de Sfax; Egyptian Knowledge Bank (EKB); Tanta University,"Bouteraa, Y (corresponding author), Prince Sattam bin Abdulaziz Univ, Al Kharj, Saudi Arabia.; Bouteraa, Y (corresponding author), ENIS, CEM Lab, Sfax, Tunisia.; Bouteraa, Y (corresponding author), Univ Sfax, Digital Res Ctr Sfax, Sfax, Tunisia.",yassinebouteraa@gmail.com; ismaelbanabdallah@yahoo.fr; a.elmogy@psau.edu.sa,"Elmogy, Ahmed/ABB-4988-2021; Bouteraa, Yassine/AAA-7999-2019; Abdallah, Ismail Ben/Q-4762-2016; Tariq, Usman/AAF-8954-2020","Elmogy, Ahmed/0000-0001-7282-6598; Bouteraa, Yassine/0000-0001-8785-3513; Abdallah, Ismail Ben/0000-0003-3836-9009;",Deanship of Scientific Research at Prince Sattam Bin Abdulaziz University [2019/01/11706],Deanship of Scientific Research at Prince Sattam Bin Abdulaziz University,This project was supported by the Deanship of Scientific Research at Prince Sattam Bin Abdulaziz University under the research project # 2019/01/11706.,,40,22,23,7,100,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0143-991X,1758-5791,,IND ROBOT,Ind.

The comparatively low cost and no-fluid-contact design of peristaltic pumps make them the go-to systems for such ventures, but using commercially available pumping systems this still becomes a costly endeavor at typically $250-$1000 per pump line. Here we have developed an alternative, a peristaltic pump that can be fabricated in most research laboratories using 3D-printing and readily available off-the-shelf parts. The pump features 8 parallel channels with linear ranges spanning from 0.7 mL/min to 6 mL/min. The pump can be fabricated and assembled by anyone with access to a 3D-printer at a cost of less than $45 per channel and is driven by a stepper motor that connects directly to any computer. This device has the potential to be disruptive in areas such as drug screening and assay development, as well as lab-on-a-chip applications and cell cultivation, where it significantly reduces hardware expenses and allows for construction of more comprehensive fluidic systems at a fraction of current costs.

Large-scale research and commercial applications of these computations are developing rapidly across artificial intelligence fields as diverse as semantic text querying, retrieval of multimedia materials, and prediction of the properties of pharmacological molecules and engineered materials. While vector similarity searching is, at present, predominantly implemented on standard central processing unit (CPU) hardware running optimized indexing algorithms, the interest in massively-parallel computing architectures is increasing. Accordingly, a range of systems based on graphics processing units (GPU) and field-programmable gate arrays (FPGA) have been proposed; however, the availability of the design materials for these systems remains largely confined to a small number of corporations and research institutions. Here, we introduce a fully open-source hardware accelerator for vector similarity searching, based on an array of 21 FPGAs densely intertwined with 42 GB of high-speed dynamic memory and installed on a custom-designed compute node board, which yields an aggregate bandwidth of 33.6 GB/s and can be seamlessly reconfigured to implement nearly arbitrary distance calculations. A novel logic and software architecture, based on a lane-wise organization of independent engines implementing distributed distance calculation and sorting, allows attaining noteworthy query latency and power consumption performance on both single- and multi-node system configurations. The entire circuit board hardware, FPGA logic, and host software design is herein presented and freely provided for unlimited use, supporting open innovation and research in this area.","[Minati, Ludovico; Fandrich, Mick] InterMot Technol Inc, Oregon City, OR 97045 USA; [Minati, Ludovico] Tokyo Inst Technol, Inst Innovat Res, Tokyo Tech World Res Hub Initiat WRHI, Yokohama, Kanagawa 2268503, Japan; [Movsisyan, Vardan; Gyozalyan, Khachatur; Papazyan, Tigran; Makaryan, Hrach; Harutyunyan, Taron; Ghaltaghchyan, Hayk] InterMot Technol LLC, Yerevan 0014, Armenia; [Mccormick, Matthew; Mccormick, Chris] in2H2 Inc, Nearist Ai, Folsom, CA 95630 USA; [Aldrigo, Stefano] Tecno77 SRL, I-36040 Brendola, Italy",Tokyo Institute of Technology,"Minati, L (corresponding author), InterMot Technol Inc, Oregon City, OR 97045 USA.; Minati, L (corresponding author), Tokyo Inst Technol, Inst Innovat Res, Tokyo Tech World Res Hub Initiat WRHI, Yokohama, Kanagawa 2268503, Japan.",lminati@ieee.org,"Minati, Ludovico/R-1076-2017","Minati, Ludovico/0000-0002-2532-1674",,,,,49,0,0,2,10,IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC,PISCATAWAY,"445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA",2169-3536,,,IEEE ACCESS,IEEE Access,,2019,7,,,,,,112269,112283,,10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2934715,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2934715,,,15,"Computer Science, Information Systems; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Telecommunications",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Computer Science; Engineering; Telecommunications,IT4LF,,gold,,,8/15/24,WOS:000482831700010,,0,256,,,

The challenge is to consider all of the different structures and components available and build the optimal power management on a microscale. The purpose of this paper is to streamline the design process by creating a novel reconfigurable testbed called Medlay. First, we propose a uniform interface for management functions e.g., power conversion, energy storing and power routing. This interface results in a clear layout because power and status pins are strictly separated, and inputs and outputs have fixed positions. Medlay is the ready-to-use and open-hardware platform based on the interface. It consists of a base board and small modules incorporating e.g., dc-dc converters, power switches and supercapacitors. Measurements confirm that Medlay represents a system on one circuit board, as parasitic effects of the interconnections are negligible. The versatility regarding different setups on the testbed is determined to over 250,000 combinations by layout graph grammar. Lastly, we underline the applicability by recreating three state-of-the-art systems with the testbed. In conclusion, Medlay facilitates building and testing power management in a very compact, clear and extensible fashion.","[Kokert, Jan; Beckedahl, Tobias; Reindl, Leonhard M.] Univ Freiburg, Dept Microsyst Engn IMTEK, Lab Elect Instrumentat, Georges Kohler Allee 106, D-79110 Freiburg, Germany",University of Freiburg,"Kokert, J (corresponding author), Univ Freiburg, Dept Microsyst Engn IMTEK, Lab Elect Instrumentat, Georges Kohler Allee 106, D-79110 Freiburg, Germany.",jan.kokert@imtek.uni-freiburg.de; becksed@googlemail.com; reindl@imtek.uni-freiburg.de,"Reindl, Leonhard/AAH-3274-2020","Reindl, Leonhard/0000-0002-5068-8929","Ministry of Science, Research and Arts of Baden-Wurttemberg, Germany; German Research Foundation (DFG); University of Freiburg","Ministry of Science, Research and Arts of Baden-Wurttemberg, Germany; German Research Foundation (DFG)(German Research Foundation (DFG)); University of Freiburg","This work was financially supported by the Ministry of Science, Research and Arts of Baden-Wurttemberg, Germany.

Here, we combined Arduino processors with custom-developed time-based signal readout electronics for a low-cost mobile radiation detection system; the system utilizes a time-over-threshold technique that provides compact electronics. Arduino processors were used for chip configuration, serial communication, and real-time data acquisition. In this study, we tested two commercial Arduino processors, Nano and Due, in various signal environments and compared their performances.

We obtained a large number of physiological signals (electroencephalography (EEG), electrocardiography (ECG), breathing rate (BR), electrodermal activity (EDA), and skin temperature (ST)) with which we analyzed internal states in general, but with a focus on stress. The findings show the reliability and feasibility of the proposed body area network (BAN) according to battery lifetime (greater than 15 h), packet loss rate (0% for our custom-made designs), and signal quality (signal-noise ratio (SNR) of 9.8 dB for the ECG circuit, and 61.6 dB for the EDA).

CO2 is supplied through the sublimation of dry ice stored inside a thermos to create a sustained 5% CO2 supply. The unit is controlled via G-Code commands sent by the Raspberry Pi to the controller board. In addition, we built a custom software application for remote control and used the open-source Grafana dashboard for remote monitoring. Our data show that we can maintain consistent CO2 and temperature levels for over three days without manual interruption. The results from our culture plates and real-time PCR indicate that our incubator performed equally well when compared to a much more expensive commercial CO2 incubator.

Despite technological advances and a need for methodological improvements, chromogenic and fluorogenic enzymatic techniques remain the mainstays of water quality monitoring for both public health agencies and regulated utilities. We demonstrated that bioelectroanalytical approaches to FIB enumeration are possible and can be achieved using commercially available enzyme-specific resorufin glycosides, although these are expensive, not widely available or designed for purpose. Following this, we designed two naphthoquinone glycosides which performed better, achieving Escherichia coli detection in the range 5.0x10(2) to 5.0x10(5) CFUml(-1) 22-54% quicker than commercially available resorufin glycosides. The molecular design of the naphthoquinone glycosides requires fewer synthetic steps allowing them to be produced for as little as US$50 per kg. Tests with environmental samples demonstrated the low tendency for abiotic interference and that, despite specificity being maintained between -glucuronidase and -galactosidase, accurate enumeration of E.coli in environmental samples necessitates development of a selective medium. In comparison to a commercially available detection method, which has U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) approval, our approach performed better at high organism concentrations, detecting 500 organisms in 9h compared with 13.5h for the commercial method. Bioelectroanalytical detection is comparable to current approved methods and with further development could result in improved detection times. A recent trend for low-cost open-source hardware means that automated, potentiostatically controlled E.coli detection systems could be constructed for less than US$100 per channel.","[Hinks, Jamie; Han, Evelina J.

It is specifically a hardware/software platform that allows Dew Computing researchers and developers to automate performance tests on Android-based smartphones. The hardware is based on a NodeMCU Esp8266 microcontroller that runs a firmware for managing the outputs. This software allows enabling/disabling the relays that connect the sockets that power the chargers of up to 4 mobile devices minimizing the need for human intervention. The firmware runs a web server that serves Rest requests from a Rest client with the commands to drive the digital outputs. These digital outputs activate or deactivate the relays to allow current to pass or not to the sockets. Such capability is essential to automate the study of battery behavior on battery-driven devices such as smartphones. Motrol is easy to assemble, knowledge in electronics or programming languages is not necessary, it is constructed with open hardware, and it is cheap, being its total cost -USD 30.

Here, we introduce a minimal reader prototype composed of open-source hardware and open-source software that has the benefits of automatic assay quantification while avoiding the interoperability issues associated with closed-source readers. An image-processing algorithm was developed to automate the selection of an optimal region of interest and measure the average pixel intensity. When used to quantify signals produced by lateral flow immunoassays for detecting antibodies against SARS-CoV-2, results obtained with the proposed algorithm were comparable to those obtained with a manual method but with the advantage of improving the precision and accuracy when quantifying small spots or faint and patchy signals.","[Russell, Steven M.; Alba-Patino, Alejandra; Vaquer, Andreu; Clemente, Antonio; de la Rica, Roberto] Hlth Res Inst Balearic Isl IdISBa, Multidisciplinary Sepsis Grp, Palma De Mallorca 07120, Spain; [Alba-Patino, Alejandra; Vaquer, Andreu] Univ Balearic Isl, Dept Chem, Palma De Mallorca 07122, Spain; [de la Rica, Roberto] CIBER Enfermedades Infecciosas CIBERINFEC, Madrid 28029, Spain",Institut Investigacio Sanitaria Illes Balears (IdISBa); Universitat de les Illes Balears,"Russell, SM; Clemente, A (corresponding author), Hlth Res Inst Balearic Isl IdISBa, Multidisciplinary Sepsis Grp, Palma De Mallorca 07120, Spain.",andreu.vaquer@ssib.es; andreu.vaquer@ssib.es; andreu.vaquer@ssib.es; andreu.vaquer@ssib.es; roberto.delarica@ssib.es,"de la Rica, Roberto/F-9430-2014","de la Rica, Roberto/0000-0002-5750-1469; Vaquer Vadell, Andreu/0000-0002-7983-5881; Clemente, Antonio/0000-0002-0412-1315","Fundacio La Caixa [CI20-00170]; LIBERI program at IdISBa; European Union NextGenerationEU""/PRTR"";  [PDC2021-121819-I00];  [MCIN/AEI/10.13039/501100011033]","Fundacio La Caixa(La Caixa Foundation); LIBERI program at IdISBa; European Union NextGenerationEU""/PRTR""; ;","This research was funded by Fundacio La Caixa grant number CI20-00170 (CaixaImpulse Validate program).

The system is based on open-source hardware and delivers an open-source code for an adaptive Kalman filter to enhance positioning precision for data quality assurance at an outdoor experimental site. The results demonstrate that the system can deliver reliable trajectories for low-mobility objects. To mitigate accident risk and severity, varied cycling speed calming measures are tested at an experimental site. Based on the trajectory data, the statistical features of cycling velocities are evaluated and compared.

The entire system can be built for around 500 euro. Commercially available flow systems can be very expensive with equipment starting at, but often greatly exceeding, 10,000 euro. This high price of entry makes such technology prohibitively expensive for many research groups. Such systems stand to benefit the emerging academic pharmaceutical field by providing the experience and availability of reliable and affordable solutions. To implement accessible flow chemistry at research facilities, the systems must be made affordable. In addition, space in research laboratories is usually limited and commercially available flow systems can be very bulky. Having a compact and individually adjustable system is thus beneficial, with 3D printing technology offering the solution. Our compact 3D-printed system meets the needs of many applications in flow chemistry research as well as educational requirements for universities. As a proof of concept, we conceptualized, developed, and tested a custom flow system that can be used to synthesize [F-18]2-fluoro-2-desoxy-d-glucose ([F-18]FDG), the most commonly used PET-tracer. This system was designed to perform the typical functions and operations required in radiotracer production i.e. radiofluorination, dilution, SPE-trapping, deprotection, and SPE-elution.

We try to reduce some of these barriers by presenting a super-resolution upgrade to our recently presented open-source optical toolbox UC2. Our new injection moulded parts allow larger builds with higher precision. The 4x lower manufacturing tolerance compared to three-dimensional printing makes assemblies more reproducible. By adding consumer-grade available open-source hardware such as digital mirror devices and laser projectors, we demonstrate a compact three-dimensional multimodal setup that combines image scanning microscopy and structured illumination microscopy.

Extending visual Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) with other modalities such as an inertial measurement unit (IMU) can boost robustness and accuracy. However, for a tight sensor fusion, accurate time synchronization of the sensors is often crucial. Changing exposure times, internal sensor filtering, multiple clock sources and unpredictable delays from operation system scheduling and data transfer can make sensor synchronization challenging. In this paper, we present VersaVIS, an Open Versatile Multi-Camera Visual-Inertial Sensor Suite aimed to be an efficient research platform for easy deployment, integration and extension for many mobile robotic applications. VersaVIS provides a complete, open-source hardware, firmware and software bundle to perform time synchronization of multiple cameras with an IMU featuring exposure compensation, host clock translation and independent and stereo camera triggering. The sensor suite supports a wide range of cameras and IMUs to match the requirements of the application. The synchronization accuracy of the framework is evaluated on multiple experiments achieving timing accuracy of less than 1 ms. Furthermore, the applicability and versatility of the sensor suite is demonstrated in multiple applications including visual-inertial SLAM, multi-camera applications, multi-modal mapping, reconstruction and object based mapping.","[Tschopp, Florian; Riner, Michael; Fehr, Marius; Bernreiter, Lukas; Furrer, Fadri; Novkovic, Tonci; Cadena, Cesar; Siegwart, Roland; Nieto, Juan] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Autonomous Syst Lab, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland; [Fehr, Marius] Voliro Airborne Robot, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland; [Pfrunder, Andreas] Sevensense Robot, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland",Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich,"Tschopp, F (corresponding author), Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Autonomous Syst Lab, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland.",florian.tschopp@mavt.ethz.ch; michael.riner-kuhn@mavt.ethz.ch; marius.fehr@mavt.ethz.ch; lukas.bernreiter@mavt.ethz.ch; fadri.furrer@mavt.ethz.ch; tonci.novkovic@mavt.ethz.ch; andreas.pfrunder@sevensense.ch; cesarc@ethz.ch; rsiegwart@ethz.ch; nietoj@ethz.ch,"Furrer, Fadri/AAQ-3028-2020; Cadena, Cesar/AAM-4987-2020; Siegwart, Roland/A-4495-2008","Cadena, Cesar/0000-0002-2972-6011; Tschopp, Florian/0000-0001-7346-2941; Bernreiter, Lukas/0000-0002-3162-0363; Nieto, Juan/0000-0003-4808-0831; Novkovic, Tonci/0000-0003-0209-5915; Riner-Kuhn, Michael/0000-0001-7954-6468; Furrer, Fadri/0000-0002-6070-1760; Fehr, Marius/0000-0003-3276-4067; Siegwart, Roland/0000-0002-2760-7983","Siemens Mobility, Germany; National Center of Competence in Research (NCCR) Robotics through the Swiss National Science Foundation","Siemens Mobility, Germany; National Center of Competence in Research (NCCR) Robotics through the Swiss National Science Foundation(Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF))","This work was partly supported by Siemens Mobility, Germany and by the National Center of Competence in Research (NCCR) Robotics through the Swiss National Science Foundation.",,32,18,20,2,25,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,1424-8220,,SENSORS-BASEL,Sensors,MAR,2020,20,5,,,,,,,1439,10.3390/s20051439,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/s20051439,,,18,"Chemistry, Analytical; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Instruments & Instrumentation",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Chemistry; Engineering; Instruments & Instrumentation,LC4CE,32155749,"Green Published, Green Submitted, gold",,,8/15/24,WOS:000525271500201,,0,271,,,

The control strategies can be changed according to the different weather conditions and installations characteristics, which guaranties the optimum performance of the system. The use of the 3G network as communication platform makes the C&VRC useful in remote and low accessibility places, because it is the most extended worldwide.

In this paper, a low-cost, computer-aided, and geophone-based system designed to record, monitor, and analyze three-component microtremor data is presented. This proposed system is not a simple data acquisition system. It is also an integrated system developed to interpret the microtremor data using the horizontal-to-vertical spectral ratio (H/V) method without any external software. Therefore, the H/V peak frequency and amplitude can be easily estimated using this system. The proposed system has several features such as a 200 Hz sampling frequency, approximately 72 dB dynamic range, text data format, and data analysis tools. This system consists of a graphical user interface developed by using the .NET Framework 4.5.2 and external hardware that includes signal conditioning circuits, voltage converter circuit, external analog-to-digital converter, and Arduino Uno board. The proposed system uses low-cost vertical and horizontal geophones with a 4.5 Hz natural frequency to measure three-component microtremor data. The developed software undertakes many tasks such as communication between the external hardware and computer, transferring, monitoring, and recording the seismic data to the computer, and interpretation of the recorded data using the Nakamura method. Channel consistency and internal noise measurement tests were performed to demonstrate the accuracy and precision of the proposed system. The proposed system was compared to a commercial triaxial digital seismograph, and satisfactory results were obtained. The developed system is a completely open-source and open-hardware system and can be easily used in academic studies conducted by researchers and university students who are interested in seismic ambient noise analysis.","[Kafadar, Ozkan] Kocaeli Univ, Dept Comp Programming, TR-41140 Kocaeli, Turkey",Kocaeli University,"Kafadar, O (corresponding author), Kocaeli Univ, Dept Comp Programming, TR-41140 Kocaeli, Turkey.",okafadar@kocaeli.edu.tr,"KAFADAR, √ñZKAN/F-6475-2018",,,,,,20,10,10,2,7,COPERNICUS GESELLSCHAFT MBH,GOTTINGEN,"BAHNHOFSALLEE 1E, GOTTINGEN, 37081, GERMANY",2193-0856,2193-0864,,GEOSCI INSTRUM METH,Geosci.

The system features highly customisable and reproducible visible and infrared illu-mination and allows for optogenetic stimulation. OptoPi acquires images using a Raspberry Pi camera, features motorised LED-based illumination, Arduino control, as well as irradiance monitoring to fine-tune illumination conditions with real time feedback. Our open-source software (BioImageProcessing) can be used to simultaneously track multiple unmarked animals both in on-line and off-line modes. We demonstrate the functionality of OptoPi by recording and tracking under different illumination conditions the sponta-neous behaviour of larval zebrafish as well as adult Drosophila flies and their first instar lar-vae, an experimental animal that due to its small size and transparency has classically been hard to track. Further, we showcase OptoPi's optogenetic capabilities through a series of experiments using transgenic Drosophila larvae.& COPY; 2023 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Time-division multiplexed illumination allows independent readout of fluorescence evoked by different excitation wavelengths from a single photoreceiver signal. Validation experiments indicate this approach offers better signal to noise for a given average excitation light intensity than sinusoidally-modulated illumination. pyPhotometry is substantially cheaper than commercial hardware filling the same role, and we anticipate, as an open source and comparatively simple tool, it will be easily adaptable and therefore of broad interest to a wide range of users.","[Akam, Thomas; Walton, Mark E.] Univ Oxford, Dept Expt Psychol, Oxford, England; [Akam, Thomas] Champalimaud Ctr Unknown, Champalimaud Neurosci Program, Lisbon, Portugal",University of Oxford; Fundacao Champalimaud,"Akam, T (corresponding author), Univ Oxford, Dept Expt Psychol, Oxford, England.; Akam, T (corresponding author), Champalimaud Ctr Unknown, Champalimaud Neurosci Program, Lisbon, Portugal.",thomas.akam@psy.ox.ac.uk,,,Wellcome Senior Research Fellowship [202831/Z/16/Z],Wellcome Senior Research Fellowship(Wellcome Trust),"We thank Laura Grima for providing the dopamine neuron recording shown in Figure 5a, b, and for comments on the manuscript.

The operators will be able to remotely control the machines and in case of handling dangerous material or accidents, there would only be damage to the hardware components. Many of the process parameters can also be read with low-cost probes and devices that can be easily interfaced with microprocessors. We include for example, but not limited to, temperature, pH, redox potential, electrochemical measurements in general or the use of probes for specific analytes.

This device supports a number of potential waveforms necessary to perform cyclic, square wave, linear sweep and anodic stripping voltammetry. As we demonstrate, it is suitable for a wide range of applications ranging from food-and drug-quality testing to environmental monitoring, rapid DNA detection, and educational exercises. The device's schematics, parts lists, circuit board layout files, sample experiments, and detailed assembly instructions are available in the supporting information and are released under an open hardware license.","[Rowe, Aaron A.; Bonham, Andrew J.; White, Ryan J.; Plaxco, Kevin W.] Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Dept Chem & Biochem, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA; [Zimmer, Michael P.; Yadgar, Ramsin J.; Hobza, Tony M.; Honea, Jim W.; Ben-Yaacov, Ilan; Plaxco, Kevin W.] Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA; [Plaxco, Kevin W.] Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Program Biomol Sci & Engn, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA",University of California System; University of California Santa Barbara; University of California System; University of California Santa Barbara; University of California System; University of California Santa Barbara,"Rowe, AA (corresponding author), Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Dept Chem & Biochem, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA.",kwp@chem.ucsb.edu,"White, Ryan J/G-9043-2013; Plaxco, Kevin/O-1793-2013","Plaxco, Kevin/0000-0003-4772-8771; Rowe, Aaron/0000-0003-3724-0318; Bonham, Andrew/0000-0003-1591-8378","Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation through the Grand Challenges Explorations Initiative [OPP1015402]; National Institutes of Health [GM062958-01, 2R01EB002046]; United States Department of Energy by Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory [DE-AC52-07NA27344]; Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation [OPP1015402] Funding Source: Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation",Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation through the Grand Challenges Explorations Initiative; National Institutes of Health(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA); United States Department of Energy by Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation(Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation),"This project was funded by a grant (OPP1015402) from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation through the Grand Challenges Explorations Initiative, and by the National Institutes of Health through grants GM062958-01 and 2R01EB002046.

As questions asked of behaviour and brain activity become more sophisticated, the ability to specify and run richly structured tasks becomes more important. An increasing focus on reproducibility also necessitates accurate communication of task logic to other researchers. To these ends, we developed pyControl, a system of open-source hardware and software for controlling behavioural experiments comprising a simple yet flexible Python-based syntax for specifying tasks as extended state machines, hardware modules for building behavioural setups, and a graphical user interface designed for efficiently running high-throughput experiments on many setups in parallel, all with extensive online documentation. These tools make it quicker, easier, and cheaper to implement rich behavioural tasks at scale. As important, pyControl facilitates communication and reproducibility of behavioural experiments through a highly readable task definition syntax and self-documenting features. Here, we outline the system's design and rationale, present validation experiments characterising system performance, and demonstrate example applications in freely moving and head-fixed mouse behaviour.","[Akam, Thomas; Walton, Mark E.] Univ Oxford, Dept Expt Psychol, Oxford, England; [Akam, Thomas; Costa, Rui M.] Champalimaud Ctr Unknown, Champalimaud Neurosci Program, Lisbon, Portugal; [Lustig, Andy] Howard Hughes Med Inst, Janelia Res Campus, Ashburn, VA USA; [Rowland, James M.; Panniello, Mariangela; Kohl, Michael M.] Univ Oxford, Dept Physiol Anat & Genet, Oxford, England; [Kapanaiah, Sampath K.

Often computer screens, speakers and keyboards are sufficient. However, these devices are not appropriate for some situations. For example, some studies present tactile or olfactory stimuli or brain stimulation. Likewise, keyboard buttons are not appropriate for use with vocal responses, small animals or individuals with motor impairments. New method: We describe StimSync, which simulates USB keyboard inputs, allowing use with most experimental software. StimSync can measure button presses, optical signals from magnetic resonance imaging systems, changes in ambient light (e.g. synchronizing intracranial electrography), and auditory events (a voice key). In addition to the USB keyboard mode (necessarily millisecond precision), StimSync can also be set to provide higher precision timing. This feature can be used to validate timing, ensuring event synchronization (e.g. auditory events, visual events, brain stimulation). In addition to recording inputs, StimSync provides seven digital outputs for controlling external devices. Finally, StimSync can record analog inputs; we illustrate how this can be used to evaluate the rise time for computer displays. Results: We observed outputs with a mean latency of 2.1 ms (sd = 0.17 ms) and USB inputs with a mean latency of 2 ms (sd = 0.54 ms). Comparison with existing method(s): StimSync statistically outperforms two professional solutions and numerically outperforms other devices described in the literature. Conclusions: StimSync (http://www.mccauslandcenter.sc.edu/CRNL/tools/stimsync) provides an open-source solution for controlling and validating neuroscience experiments. In addition to sharing the design, we have produced a batch of devices to demonstrate the market for professional implementations.

Although they can host different types of sensors, these vehicles were specifically designed for geophysical surveys, i.e., for the acquisition of bathymetric and stratigraphic data through single- and multibeam echosounders, side-scan sonars, and seismic-reflection systems. The main characteristic of the OpenSWAP vehicles is their ability of following pre-defined routes with high accuracy under acceptable weather and sea conditions. This would open the door to 4D (repeated) surveys, which constitute a powerful tool to analyze morphological and stratigraphic changes of the sediment/water interface and of the shallow substratum eventually caused by sediment dynamics (erosion vs. deposition), slumps and gravitative failures, earthquakes (slip along seismogenic faults and secondary effects of shaking), tsunamis, etc. The low cost and the open hardware/software architectures of these systems, which can be modified by the end users, lead for planning and execution of cooperative and adaptive surveys with different instruments not yet implemented or tested. Together with a technical description of the vehicles, we provide different case studies where they were successfully employed, carried out in environments not, or very difficultly accessed through conventional systems.","[Stanghellini, Giuseppe; Gasperini, Luca] CNR, UO Geol Marina, Ist Sci Marine, ISMAR CNR, Via Gobetti 101, I-40129 Bologna, Italy; [Del Bianco, Fabrizio] Proambiente Scrl, Via Gobetti 101, I-40129 Bologna, Italy",Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche (CNR); Istituto di Scienze Marine (ISMAR-CNR),"Gasperini, L (corresponding author), CNR, UO Geol Marina, Ist Sci Marine, ISMAR CNR, Via Gobetti 101, I-40129 Bologna, Italy.",giuseppe.stanghellini@ismar.cnr.it; f.delbianco@consorzioproambiente.it; luca.gasperini@ismar.cnr.it,"Gasperini, Luca/B-8796-2017","STANGHELLINI, GIUSEPPE/0000-0003-1315-6066; Del Bianco, Fabrizio/0000-0002-6277-0145; Gasperini, Luca/0000-0002-0276-0607",POR-FESR Emilia Romagna Project NAIADI,POR-FESR Emilia Romagna Project NAIADI,This research was funded by POR-FESR Emilia Romagna Project NAIADI (P.I.

However, most vitrification tools adopted in aquatic research were initially designed for applications other than sperm (such as human embryo freezing) and, thus, pose challenges for adoption to sperm vitrification. Three-dimensional (3D) printing combined with open hardware sharing is an emerging strategy to address challenges in the development of cryopreservation tools. The goal of this study was to develop a 3D printed Vitrification Device for Cryo-Vials (VDCV) that can be integrated with the existing vial storage systems. The VDCV combined the vitrification and handling components to achieve functions of sample handling, vitrification, storage, and identification. The vitrification component featured a base, a stem, and a loop. A total of 36 configurations with various loop lengths (8, 10, and 12 mm); loop widths (2.0, 2.5, 3.0, and 3.5 mm); and support structures (open, transverse, and axial) of the VDCD prototypes were designed, fabricated, and tested. Device handling orientations (horizontal and vertical holding angles prior to and during freezing) were also investigated. Computer simulations estimated that the cooling rate of the samples ranged from 0.6-1.5 x 10(5) degrees C/min in all the configurations. Prior to freezing, loops with axial supports produced a minimum of 92% film retention. The overall trends of full vitrification occurrence were observed: horizontal plunging > vertical plunging, and axial support > transverse support and open loop. A loop length of 8 mm had the highest overall vitrification occurrence (86-100%). No significant differences (p = 0.6584) were shown in a volume capacity (5.7-6.0 mu L) among the three supporting configurations. A single unit of VDCV can provide loading efficiencies of about 6 x 10(7) sperm/vial, pooling of samples from 3-6 males/vial, and fertilization for 1800 eggs/vial. The VDCV are low-cost (<$0.5 material cost per unit) and can be customized, standardized, securely labeled, and efficiently stored. The prototypes can be accessed by user communities through open-fabrication file sharing and fabricated with consumer-level 3D printers, thus facilitating community-level standardization.","[Liu, Yue; Lin, Andy; Monroe, William Todd] Louisiana State Univ, Agr Ctr, Dept Biol & Agr Engn, Baton Rouge, LA 70803 USA; [Liu, Yue; Tiersch, Terrence R.] Louisiana State Univ, Aquat Germplasm & Genet Resources Ctr, Sch Renewable Nat Resources, Agr Ctr, Baton Rouge, LA 70820 USA",Louisiana State University System; Louisiana State University; Louisiana State University System; Louisiana State University,"Monroe, WT (corresponding author), Louisiana State Univ, Agr Ctr, Dept Biol & Agr Engn, Baton Rouge, LA 70803 USA.",yliu@agcenter.lsu.edu; andylinbr@gmail.com; ttiersch@agcenter.lsu.edu; tmonroe@lsu.edu,,"Liu, Yue/0000-0003-3838-8277; Monroe, William Todd/0000-0002-7889-3799","National Institutes of Health, Office of Research Infrastructure Programs [R24-OD010441, R24-OD028443]; National Institute of Food and Agriculture, United States Department of Agriculture (Hatch project) [LAB94420]; Louisiana State University Research & Technology Foundation [AG-2018-LIFT-003]; LSU-ACRES (Audubon Center for Research of Endangered Species) Collaborative Program","National Institutes of Health, Office of Research Infrastructure Programs; National Institute of Food and Agriculture, United States Department of Agriculture (Hatch project); Louisiana State University Research & Technology Foundation; LSU-ACRES (Audubon Center for Research of Endangered Species) Collaborative Program","This work was supported in part by funding from the National Institutes of Health, Office of Research Infrastructure Programs (R24-OD010441 and R24-OD028443), with additional support provided by the National Institute of Food and Agriculture, United States Department of Agriculture (Hatch project LAB94420), the Louisiana State University Research & Technology Foundation (AG-2018-LIFT-003), and the LSU-ACRES (Audubon Center for Research of Endangered Species) Collaborative Program.",,39,10,10,2,13,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2076-3417,,APPL SCI-BASEL,Appl.

It enables drivers to confidently share their vehicle information across multiple applications to improve the transportation experience for all stakeholders, as well as to potentially monetize their data. The foundations for an application ecosystem have been developed which, taken together with the fair value for driving data and low barriers to entry, will drive adoption of CloudThink as the standard method for projecting physical vehicles into the cloud.

To achieve standardization of sperm activation, microfluidic mixers have shown improved reproducibility over activation by hand, but challenges remain in optimizing and simplifying the use of these microdevices for greater adoption. The device described herein incorporates a novel micromixer geometry that aligns two sperm inlet streams with modified herringbone structures that split and recombine the sample at a 1:6 dilution with water to achieve rapid and consistent initiation of motility. The polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) chip can be operated in a positive or negative pressure configuration, allowing a simple micropipettor to draw samples into the chip and rapidly stop the flow. The device was optimized to not only activate zebrafish sperm but also enables practical use with standard computer-assisted sperm analysis (CASA) systems. The micromixer geometry could be modified for other aquatic species with differing cell sizes and adopted for an open hardware approach using 3D resin printing where users could revise, fabricate, and share designs to improve standardization and reproducibility across laboratories and repositories.","[Belgodere, Jorge A.

In the presented work, we have proposed a simple system for microscopy utilising open-source platform Arduino. Testing this system showed that it had sufficient sensitivity to determine the physical processes occurring in a cryopreserved sample such as intra- and extracellular water crystallisation and salt eutectic. Utilising this system, we investigated the mechanisms of cryoprotection and cryodamage of testis interstitial cells (ICs) in cryoprotective media, which included cryoprotective agents such as dimethyl sulphoxide (Me2SO), as well as foetal bovine serum or polymers (dextran, hydroxyethyl starch and polyethylene glycol). It was shown that a serum-/xeno-free medium that included 0.7 M Me2SO and 100 mg/mL dextran was able to reduce intracellular water crystallisation in cells, change the structure of extracellular ice, and reduce salt eutectic and recrystallisation. All these effects correlated with better IC survival after cryopreservation in the medium. This medium is potentially less toxic as it has lower concentrations of Me2SO compared to serum-containing media developed for cryopreservation of testicular cells. This would pave a way for the creation of nontoxic serum-free compositions that does not require removal before use of cryopreserved living cells for laboratory practice or in clinics. Research in the field of cryobiology involves many technics linked with the assessment of cell recovery after cooling/warming as well as quantification, identification and description of physical processes occurring in and out of the cells. These processes can affect the overall outcome of cryopreservation. Thus, the investigation of the mechanisms of cryoprotection and cryodamage is of high importance. In this work, we have developed a system for cryomicroscopy utilising open-source platform for prototyping electronic devices and systems Arduino. The platform includes hardware and software designed to develop various projects. It also supports a programming language. The language was used to create a code to control cooling rate of the sample undergoing microscopy. The system was able to visualise the structure of the forming ice crystals, recrystallisation, salt eutectic crystallisation/melting and intracellular phase transitions. It can be utilised in combination with other approaches and techniques. The system helped us to solve specific tasks of cryobiological experimentation connected with the establishment of mechanisms of cryoprotection and cryodamage of testis interstitial cells (ICs). The microscopy data allowed us to compare different media developed for cryopreservation of testicular cells. The serum-containing cryoprotective medium (1.4 M Me2SO and 10% foetal bowine serum) was able to suppress darkening of cell, known as 'flashing' associated with intracellular phase transitions by moderately dehydrating cells, and salt eutectic transitions during cooling/warming. However, the media contains relatively high Me2SO concentration and may be toxic. Additionally, the use of serum in the media can result in transferring infection when cryopreserved cells are used in medicine or veterinary, or lead to instability of the composition of serum-containing media from batch to batch. In the course of the research, we have shown that using the serum-/xeno-free medium supplemented with 0.7 M Me2SO and 100 mg/mL Dex (0.7 Me2SO+Dex) can also reduce cell 'flashing'. The medium influenced the size and shape of extracellular ice crystals in a way that can potentially reduce the risk of mechanical cell damage. This medium promoted amorphous solidification in the space between the extracellular ice crystals, thus, lowering the salt eutectic transitions and recrystallisation that could otherwise cause additional cell damage. Therefore, application of the developed system for cryomicroscopy, which allowed real-time visualisation of cryobiological processes, made it possible to draw a conclusion about cryoprotecitive properties of medium for ICs. 0.7 Me2SO+Dex can be the basis for the creation of commercial serum-free media with a defined composition that does not require removal before use.","[Pakhomov, Oleksandr; Shevchenko, Nadiia; Chernobai, Nadiia; Prokopiuk, Volodymyr; Yershov, Serhii; Bozhok, Galyna] Natl Acad Sci Ukraine, Inst Problems Cryobiol & Cryomed, Dept Cryoendocrinol, Kharkiv, Ukraine; [Pakhomov, Oleksandr] Natl Acad Sci Ukraine, Inst Problems Cryobiol & Cryomed, Dept Cryoendocrinol, 23 Pereyaslavskaya St, UA-61016 Kharkiv, Ukraine",National Academy of Sciences Ukraine; Institute for Problems of Cryobiology & Cryomedicine of NASU; National Academy of Sciences Ukraine; Institute for Problems of Cryobiology & Cryomedicine of NASU,"Pakhomov, O (corresponding author), Natl Acad Sci Ukraine, Inst Problems Cryobiol & Cryomed, Dept Cryoendocrinol, 23 Pereyaslavskaya St, UA-61016 Kharkiv, Ukraine.",aleksandr.pakhomov2017@gmail.com,"Shevchenko, Nadiia/AAE-3992-2022","Shevchenko, Nadiia/0000-0001-6794-1444; Pakhomov, Oleksandr/0000-0002-7494-654X",,,,,58,0,0,1,2,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-2720,1365-2818,,J MICROSC-OXFORD,J.

More people than ever-from artists, makers and entrepreneurs to educators and students-are connecting microcontrollers with sensors and actuators to create new interactive devices. However, physical computing still presents many challenges and demands many skills, spanning electronics, low-level protocols, and software-road blocks that reduce participation. While USB has made connecting peripherals to a personal computing device (PC) trivial, USB components are expensive and require a PC to operate. This makes USB impractical for many physical computing scenarios where cost, size and low power operation are often important. We introduce Jacdac, an open-source hardware and software platform that brings the user experience of USB to physical computing at a fraction of the cost and resource requirements. It combines an intuitive connector, standardized hardware and software interfaces, a simple bus-based protocol that runs on virtually any microcontroller, and integration with Microsoft MakeCode for the micro:bit. In this way, Jacdac provides a low-cost, extensible web-based plug-and-play experience for physical computing. We evaluated Jacdac in an international hackathon involving over 80 participants who built functional artifacts with Jacdac.

For example, researcher-developed sensors, such as audio and video loggers, are being increasingly attached to wildlife tracking collars to provide insights into a range of topics from species interactions to physiology. However, such devices are often prohibitively power-intensive, relative to conventional wildlife collar sensors, and their retrieval without compromising long-term data collection and animal welfare remains a challenge. We present an open-source system (SensorDrop) for remotely detaching individual sensors from wildlife collars. SensorDrop facilitates the retrieval of power-intensive sensors while leaving non-resource-intensive sensors intact on animals. SensorDrop systems can be made using commercially available components and are a fraction of the cost of other timed drop-off devices that detach full wildlife tracking collars. From 2021 to 2022, eight SensorDrop units were successfully deployed on free-ranging African wild dog packs in the Okavango Delta as part of audio-accelerometer sensor bundles attached to wildlife collars. All SensorDrop units detached after 2-3 weeks and facilitated the collection of audio and accelerometer data while leaving wildlife GPS collars intact to continue collecting locational data (>1 year), critical for long-term conservation population monitoring in the region. SensorDrop offers a low-cost method to remotely detach and retrieve individual sensors from wildlife collars. By selectively detaching battery-depleted sensors, SensorDrop maximizes the amount of data collected per wildlife collar deployment and mitigates ethical concerns on animal rehandling. SensorDrop adds to the growing body of open-source animal-borne technologies being utilized by wildlife researchers to innovate and expand upon data collection practices and supports the continued ethical use of novel technologies within wildlife studies.","[Rafiq, K.; Abrahms, B.] Univ Washington, Ctr Ecosyst Sentinels, Dept Biol, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Rafiq, K.; Abrahms, B.] Botswana Predator Conservat, Maun, Botswana; [Appleby, R.

Given fundamental power requirements for such communication, burdened mass guidelines and battery technology, this constraint necessitates the continued use of very high frequency (VHF) radio beacons. As such, efforts should be made to mitigate their primary deficiencies: detection range, localization time and localization accuracy. The integration of a radiotelemetry system with an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) could significantly improve the capacity for data collection from VHF tags. We present a UAV-integrated radiotelemetry system that relies on open source hardware and software. Localization methods, including signal processing, bearing estimation based on principal component analysis, localization techniques and test results, are discussed. Using a low-power beacon applicable for bats and small birds, testing showed that the improved vantage of the UAV-radiotelemetry system (UAV-RT) provided significantly higher received signal power compared to the low-level flights (maximum range beyond 1.4 km). Flight testing of localization methods showed median bearing errors between 2.3 degrees and 6.8 degrees, with localization errors of between 5% and 14% of the distance to the tag. In a direct comparison to an experienced radiotelemetry user, the UAV-RT system provided bearing and localization estimates with 53% less error. This paper introduces the core functionality and use methods of the UAV-RT system, while presenting baseline localization performance metrics. An associated website hosts plans for assembly and software installation. The methods of UAV-RT use for tag detection will be further developed in future works. For both the detection and localization problems, the mobility of a flying asset drastically reduces tracker time requirements. A 7-min flight would be sufficient to collect five equally spaced bearing estimates over a 1-km transect. The use of a software-defined radio on the UAV-RT system will allow for the simultaneous detection and localization of multiple tags.","[Shafer, Michael W.; Vega, Gabriel; Rothfus, Kellan] No Arizona Univ, Dept Mech Engn, Flagstaff, AZ 86011 USA; [Flikkema, Paul] No Arizona Univ, Sch Informat Comp & Cyber Syst, Flagstaff, AZ 86011 USA",Northern Arizona University; Northern Arizona University,"Shafer, MW (corresponding author), No Arizona Univ, Dept Mech Engn, Flagstaff, AZ 86011 USA.",michael.shafer@nau.edu,,"Shafer, Michael/0000-0001-6894-4460; Flikkema, Paul/0000-0003-2985-7895",Division of Biological Infrastructure [1556417]; National Science Foundation; Direct For Biological Sciences; Div Of Biological Infrastructure [1556417] Funding Source: National Science Foundation,Division of Biological Infrastructure(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Biological Sciences (BIO)); National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Direct For Biological Sciences; Div Of Biological Infrastructure(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Biological Sciences (BIO)),"Division of Biological Infrastructure, Grant/Award Number: 1556417; National Science Foundation",,32,12,17,3,39,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",2041-210X,2041-2096,,METHODS ECOL EVOL,Methods Ecol.

At locations where the ultrasound image showed distinct irregularities, scanning electron microscopy images identified mossy surface layers typical for lithium plating.","[Wasylowski, David; Kisseler, Niklas; Ditler, Heinrich; Sonnet, Morian; Fuchs, Georg; Ringbeck, Florian; Sauer, Dirk Uwe] Rhein Westfal TH Aachen, Inst Power Elect & Elect Drives ISEA, Chair Electrochem Energy Convers & Storage Syst, Jagerstr 17-19, D-52066 Aachen, Germany; [Sauer, Dirk Uwe] Rhein Westfal TH Aachen, Inst Power Generat & Storage Syst PGS, E ON ERC, Mathieustr 10, D-52074 Aachen, Germany; [Wasylowski, David; Ditler, Heinrich; Sonnet, Morian; Ringbeck, Florian; Sauer, Dirk Uwe] JARA Energy, Julich Aachen Res Alliance, Templergraben 55, D-52056 Aachen, Germany; [Sauer, Dirk Uwe] Forschungszentrum Julich, Helmholtz Inst Munster HI MS, IEK 12, D-52425 Julich, Germany; [Fuchs, Georg] Safion GmbH, Huttenstr 7, D-52068 Aachen, Germany",RWTH Aachen University; E-ON; RWTH Aachen University; Helmholtz Association; Research Center Julich,"Wasylowski, D (corresponding author), Rhein Westfal TH Aachen, Inst Power Elect & Elect Drives ISEA, Chair Electrochem Energy Convers & Storage Syst, Jagerstr 17-19, D-52066 Aachen, Germany.",david.wasylowski@isea.rwth-aachen.de,"Sauer, Dirk Uwe/A-7414-2012","Sauer, Dirk Uwe/0000-0002-5622-3591; Ditler, Heinrich/0000-0002-4320-6207; Wasylowski, David/0000-0001-8629-7439; Sonnet, Morian/0000-0002-6168-2880; Kisseler, Niklas/0000-0002-6462-3042","Federal Ministry of Education and Research, Germany, the research cluster ""Batterienutzungskonzepte'' through the project MADAM4Life [03XP0327C]; Federal Ministry of Education and Research, Germany, the research cluster ""AQua'' through the project InOPlaBat [03XP0352A]","Federal Ministry of Education and Research, Germany, the research cluster ""Batterienutzungskonzepte'' through the project MADAM4Life; Federal Ministry of Education and Research, Germany, the research cluster ""AQua'' through the project InOPlaBat","This work was funded by the Federal Ministry of Education and Research, Germany as part of the research cluster ""Batterienutzungskonzepte'' through the project MADAM4Life (grant number 03XP0327C) and as part of the research cluster ""AQua'' through the project InOPlaBat (grant number 03XP0352A).

This has lately been applied in the educational domain, aimed to better support learners during the learning process. For this purpose, we have developed the AICARP (Ambient Intelligence Context-aware Affective Recommender Platform) infrastructure, which detects changes in the emotional state of the user and provides personalized multisensorial support to help manage the emotional state by taking advantage of ambient intelligence features. We have developed a third version of this infrastructure, AICARP.V3, which addresses several problems detected in the data acquisition stage of the second version, (i.e., intrusion of the pulse sensor, poor resolution and lowsignal to noise ratio in the galvanic skin response sensor and slow response time of the temperature sensor) and extends the capabilities to integrate new actuators. This improved incorporates a new acquisition platform(shield) called PhyAS (Physiological Acquisition Shield), which reduces the number of control units to only one, and supports both gathering physiological signalswith better precision and delivering multisensory feedback with more flexibility, by means of new actuators that can be added/discarded on top of just that single shield. The improvements in the quality of the acquired signals allow better recognition of the emotional states. Thereof, AICARP.V3 gives a more accurate personalized emotional support to the user, based on a rule-based approach that triggers multisensorial feedback, if necessary. This represents progress in solving an open problem: develop systems that perform as effectively as a human expert in a complex task such as the recognition of emotional states.","[Uria-Rivas, R.; Santos, O.

A lack of affordable and adaptable tools in this area limits research progress and harmonized quality assurance.PurposeTo develop and test a suite of open-source hardware and software tools for the measurement, characterization, reporting, and correction of geometric distortion in MRI.MethodsAn open-source python library was developed, comprising modules for parametric phantom design, data processing, spherical harmonics, distortion correction, and interactive reporting. The code was used to design and manufacture a distortion phantom consisting of 618 oil filled markers covering a sphere of radius 150 mm. This phantom was imaged on a CT scanner and a novel split-bore 1.0 T MRI magnet. The CT images provide distortion-free dataset. These data were used to test all modules of the open-source software.ResultsAll markers were successfully extracted from all images. The distorted MRI markers were mapped to undistorted CT data using an iterative search approach. Spherical harmonics reconstructed the fitted gradient data to 1.0 +/- 0.6% of the input data. High resolution data were reconstructed via spherical harmonics and used to generate an interactive report. Finally, distortion correction on an independent data set reduced distortion inside the DSV from 5.5 +/- 3.1 to 1.6 +/- 0.8 mm.ConclusionOpen-source hardware and software for the measurement, characterization, reporting, and correction of geometric distortion in MRI have been developed. The utility of these tools has been demonstrated via their application on a novel 1.0 T split bore magnet.","[Whelan, Brendan M.; Liu, Paul Z. Y.; Shan, Shanshan; Waddington, David E.

The proposed RCP system consists of a PC-based computer-aided control system design (CACSD) tool for computing control action and tiny palm-sized open source hardware for input and output (I/O) operation and data transfer through a built-in high-speed USB interface. The popular-priced and portable open source hardware is used as a bridge between CACSD tools and real plants to deliver the control and sensor data at the sampling time points. Ten I/O function blocks written in C code are developed based on the CACSD tool employed for the proposed light-weight RCP system in order to handle I/O operation in a simple way. In addition, we suggest two practical strategies, a batch transfer strategy and a variable sampling period method, to increase the sampling rate of the control system. It is shown through experiment that the proposed light-weight RCP system works well up to a sampling rate of 2 kHz without adopting expensive hardware and C code generators.

The capabilities can be extended to data taking and signal analysis at mid-level rates. Two detector realizations are presented, which cover the readouts of proportional counter tubes and of scintillators or wavelength-shifting fibers with silicon photomultipliers (SiPMs). The SiPMTrigger realizes a small-scale design for coincidence readout of SiPMs as a trigger or veto detector. It consists of a custom mixed signal front-end board featuring signal amplification, discrimination and a coincidence unit for rates of up to 200 kHz. The nCatcher transforms an Arduino Nano to a proportional counter readout with pulse shape analysis: time over threshold measurement and a 10-bit analog-to-digital converter for pulse heights. The device is suitable for low-to-medium-rate environments up to 5 kHz, where a good signal-to-noise ratio is crucial. We showcase the monitoring of thermal neutrons.

Therefore, injections can be given in order to deliver substances that cannot cross the blood-brain barrier. The two most important parameters of the microinjection to control are volume and speed. The volume should not be so large that it displaces the brain tissue and tears it. The injection speed must also be slow so that the liquid that comes out of the syringe can diffuse into the tissue without displacing it and damaging it.

In 1993 the Cuban Meteorological Service decided to mount a modernized radar prototype at Camaguey Meteorological Center, incorporating computer control and data acquisition hardware to achieve fully unmanned operation. Modernization of conventional weather radars is now possible within a small budget using open hardware and software architectures. Our Primary Processor ""ELBRUS"" (Signal Processor + Radar Controller) makes use of available computer cards and commercial PC systems. The system architecture was designed with a particular stress on software. All functions that could be handled within the Data Acquisition Computer have been put there. Also, a versatile Product Generator and Processing System were developed. Vests processor Vesta RPG and its front end application Vesta\Process deal with product and composite generation, data base management and web server links. They function in a server-client fashion using standard protocols. Results obtained with this prototype are now being extended to other 6 radars under a National Program for the modernization of the Cuban Weather Radar Network, which also includes composition and distribution of the products.

A smartphone Bluetooth Android interface was also created to circumvent the use of a computer. We demonstrated that our scheme is suitable for measurements in classical electrochemical conditions but also to carry out experiments with ultramicroelectrodes. We could thus reach a noise resolution of less than 1 pA. Scan rates of 8000 Vs-1 with ohmic drop compensation were also achieved. The device is suitable for teaching purposes but also for experiments in a participative science context on the ground, or countries with lower financial possibilities. (c) 2022 The Author(s).

The sensor, based on instantaneous measurements, functions as a position server for dual-axis solar trackers in photovoltaic plants. The proposed device has been developed with free software and hardware, which makes it a pioneering solution because it is open and accessible as well as capable of being improved by the scientific community, thereby contributing to the rapid advancement of technology. In addition, the device includes an algorithm developed ex professo that makes it possible to predetermine the regions of the celestial sphere for which, according to the geometric characteristics of the PV plant, there would be shading between the panels. In this way, solar trackers do not have to locate the Sun's position at all times according to astronomical models, while taking into account factors such as shadows or cloudiness that also affect levels of incident irradiance on solar collectors. Therefore, with this device, it is possible to provide photovoltaic plants with dual-axis solar tracking with a low-cost device that helps to optimise the trajectory of the trackers and, consequently, their radiative capture and energy production.","[Gomez-Uceda, Francisco J.] Univ Cordoba, Dept Mech, Campus Rabanales, Cordoba 14071, Spain; [Ramirez-Faz, Jose; Fernandez-Ahumada, Luis Manuel] Univ Cordoba, Dept Elect Engn & Automat, Campus Rabanales, Cordoba 14071, Spain; [Varo-Martinez, Marta] Univ Cordoba, Dept Appl Phys Radiol & Phys Med, Campus Rabanales, Cordoba 14071, Spain",Universidad de Cordoba; Universidad de Cordoba; Universidad de Cordoba,"Varo-Martinez, M (corresponding author), Univ Cordoba, Dept Appl Phys Radiol & Phys Med, Campus Rabanales, Cordoba 14071, Spain.",fjgomez@uco.es; jramirez@uco.es; fa2vamam@uco.es; lmfernandez@uco.es,"Fern√°ndez-Ahumada, Luis Manuel/AAC-3303-2020; Fern√É¬°ndez-Ahumada, Luis M./GNW-2351-2022; VARO-MARTINEZ, MARTA/F-9794-2016; Gomez Uceda, Francisco Javier/GQZ-2137-2022","Fern√°ndez-Ahumada, Luis Manuel/0000-0002-2355-0190; VARO-MARTINEZ, MARTA/0000-0003-4867-5528; Ramirez Faz, Jose/0000-0002-6529-0649; Gomez Uceda, Francisco Javier/0000-0002-2350-0900",CLARA Project from the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme [730482]; H2020 Societal Challenges Programme [730482] Funding Source: H2020 Societal Challenges Programme,CLARA Project from the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme; H2020 Societal Challenges Programme(Horizon 2020European Union (EU)H2020 Societal Challenges Programme),"This research is partially supported by the CLARA Project, which has received funding from the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under Grant Agreement No 730482.",,65,8,8,2,5,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,1424-8220,,SENSORS-BASEL,Sensors,FEB,2021,21,3,,,,,,,726,10.3390/s21030726,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/s21030726,,,16,"Chemistry, Analytical; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Instruments & Instrumentation",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Chemistry; Engineering; Instruments & Instrumentation,QD4LU,33494507,"Green Published, gold",,,8/15/24,WOS:000615492600001,,0,302,,,

This study analyzes the economic impacts of a theoretical international agreement that eliminates patent rights for any nuclear aggressor (i.e., free global compulsory licensing of all intellectual property (IP) for a nuclear aggressor). The results found that all but one of the nuclear states would have a significant economic disincentive to start a nuclear attack if the proposal was put into force. Payback times ranged from 1.2 to 40 years, where the entire GDP of a nuclear aggressor would be needed to offset the loss for aggression, indicate such a mechanism as a whole would be an effective nuclear deterrent. This method would not be universally effective without ensuring all nuclear states are members of the international economy and IP processes. With the growth of open-source products and reduced value of patents, this mechanism does have a limited effectiveness time. Currently it appears to be a policy trajectory worthy of future work that can enhance safety from nuclear threat without causing harm to countries of goodwill.","[Pearce, Joshua M.] Western Univ, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, London, ON N6A 5B9, Canada; [Pearce, Joshua M.] Western Univ, Ivey Business Sch, London, ON N6A 5B9, Canada",Western University (University of Western Ontario); Western University (University of Western Ontario),"Pearce, JM (corresponding author), Western Univ, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, London, ON N6A 5B9, Canada.; Pearce, JM (corresponding author), Western Univ, Ivey Business Sch, London, ON N6A 5B9, Canada.",joshua.pearce@uwo.ca,"Pearce, Joshua/C-9240-2013","Pearce, Joshua/0000-0001-9802-3056",Thompson Endowment; Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada,Thompson Endowment; Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada(Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)CGIAR),This research was funded by the Thompson Endowment and the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada.,,130,0,0,0,0,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2313-576X,,SAFETY,Safety,SEP,2022,8,3,,,,,,,55,10.3390/safety8030055,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/safety8030055,,,12,"Public, Environmental & Occupational Health",Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI),"Public, Environmental & Occupational Health",4S9HY,,gold,,,8/15/24,WOS:000857743700001,,0,303,,,

A trainer for online laparoscopic surgical skills assessment based on the performance of experts and nonexperts is presented. The system uses computer vision, augmented reality, and artificial intelligence algorithms, implemented into a Raspberry Pi board with Python programming language. Methods. Two training tasks were evaluated by the laparoscopic system: transferring and pattern cutting. Computer vision libraries were used to obtain the number of transferred points and simulated pattern cutting trace by means of tracking of the laparoscopic instrument. An artificial neural network (ANN) was trained to learn from experts and nonexperts' behavior for pattern cutting task, whereas the assessment of transferring task was performed using a preestablished threshold. Four expert surgeons in laparoscopic surgery, from hospital Raymundo Abarca Alarcon, constituted the experienced class for the ANN. Sixteen trainees (10 medical students and 6 residents) without laparoscopic surgical skills and limited experience in minimal invasive techniques from School of Medicine at Universidad Autonoma de Guerrero constituted the nonexperienced class. Data from participants performing 5 daily repetitions for each task during 5 days were used to build the ANN. Results. The participants tend to improve their learning curve and dexterity with this laparoscopic training system. The classifier shows mean accuracy and receiver operating characteristic curve of 90.98% and 0.93, respectively. Moreover, the ANN was able to evaluate the psychomotor skills of users into 2 classes: experienced or nonexperienced. Conclusion. We constructed and evaluated an affordable laparoscopic trainer system using computer vision, augmented reality, and an artificial intelligence algorithm. The proposed trainer has the potential to increase the self-confidence of trainees and to be applied to programs with limited resources.","[Alonso-Silverio, Gustavo A.; Bruno-Sanchez, Raul; Alarcon-Paredes, Antonio] Univ Autonoma Guerrero, Chilpancingo, Guerrero, Mexico; [Perez-Escamirosa, Fernando] Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Ciudad De Mexico, Mexico; [Ortiz-Simon, Jose L.] Inst Tecnol Nuevo Laredo, Nuevo Laredo, Tamaulipas, Mexico; [Munoz-Guerrero, Roberto; Minor-Martinez, Arturo] Inst Politecn Nacl, Ciudad De Mexico, Mexico",Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico; Instituto Politecnico Nacional - Mexico,"Alarc√≥n-Paredes, A (corresponding author), Univ Autonoma Guerrero, Sch Engn, Av Lazaro Cardenas S-N,Ciudad Univ Zona Sur, Chilpancingo 39087, Guerrero, Mexico.",aalarcon@uagro.mx,"P√©rez-Escamirosa, Fernando/AAS-7435-2020; Alarc√≥n-Paredes, Antonio/Q-6353-2018; Minor, Arturo AMM/I-2943-2017","P√©rez-Escamirosa, Fernando/0000-0001-7886-8692; Alarc√≥n-Paredes, Antonio/0000-0002-9785-1252; Alonso-Silverio, Gustavo A/0000-0002-2699-140X",National Council of Science and Technology of Mexico,National Council of Science and Technology of Mexico(Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia (CONACyT)),"The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This work was financially supported by the National Council of Science and Technology of Mexico in a way of scholarship for Raul Bruno-Sanchez.",,42,32,33,3,34,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",1553-3506,1553-3514,,SURG INNOV,Surg.

The resultant system is highly flexible, and we present the details of the design as well as a performance analysis. CAPRI will be deployed in Peru, near the magnetic equator, for long-term operations in the area. FM stations near Lima, Peru, will be utilized with the targets of interest being the equatorial electrojet and the spread F.

Using a lower cost heat sink reduces the cost to - $6 k. The instrument is suitable for studying ambient ice nucleating particle concentrations and laboratory-based process-level studies of ice nucleation. The design plans allow individuals to self-manufacture the cold-stage using 3D printing, off-the-shelf parts, and a handful of standard tools. Software to operate the instrument and analyze the data is also provided. The design is intended to be simple enough that a graduate student can build it as part of a course or thesis project.

This task can become difficult taking into account that the subject must control all functionalities with the same limb. It can increase the risk of car accident. To reduce this type of distraction, we propose the construction of a prototype to control the functionalities in a car using gestures captured by electromyographic signals. The data is simulated by an Arduino and, afterwards, sent to a Raspberry Pi. Then we perform signal classification using an Extreme Learning Machine. The result of the classification will be used to control automotive functionalities. Our work demonstrates the feasibility of real-time car functionalities control using electromyography and efficient low-cost hardware. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

For emerging technologies, such as ambient ionization mass spectrometry (AIMS), the assembly of a functional prototype is often more time-consuming than developing the actual probes. The modification of commercial platforms for testing hardware is usually not possible due to technical and legal restrictions. Therefore, we designed a robotic platform, which is based on RepRap 3D-printer components, and therefore easy to adopt for custom set-ups. Adjustable rails in an aluminium frame construction facilitate the mounting of additional parts such as sensors, probes, or optical components. The Open LabBot uses industry-standard G-code for its control. Its simple syntax facilitates the programming of the movement. We developed two programs for the robot control and mass spectrometry imaging: ""LABI-Imaging"" for synchronizing the robot movements and MS data acquisition and ""RmsiGUI"", a software solution for the complete AIMS workflow. We proved the functionality of the system by the automated sampling and classification of essential oils with a PlasmaChip probe. Further, we performed an AIMSI imaging experiment of a lime slice with laser desorption low-temperature plasma (LD-LTP) ionization, demonstrating the integration of the complete workflow in RmsiGUI. The design of the Open LabBot and the software are released under open licenses to promote their use and adoption in the instrument developers' community.","[Rosas-Roman, Ignacio; Ovando-Vazquez, Cesare; Moreno-Pedraza, Abigail; Guillen-Alonso, Hector; Winkler, Robert] Ctr Res & Adv Studies CINVESTAV Irapuato, Dept Biochem & Biotechnol, Km 9-6 Libramiento Norte Carr Irapuato Leon, Irapuato 36824, Gto, Mexico; [Ovando-Vazquez, Cesare] Natl Supercomp Ctr, CONACYT Potosino Inst Sci & Technol Res IPYCIT, Camino Press San Jose 2055,Cot Lomas 4ta Secc, San Luis Potosi 78216, Slp, Mexico",,"Winkler, R (corresponding author), Ctr Res & Adv Studies CINVESTAV Irapuato, Dept Biochem & Biotechnol, Km 9-6 Libramiento Norte Carr Irapuato Leon, Irapuato 36824, Gto, Mexico.",robert.winIder@cinvestay.mx,"; Winkler, Robert/A-1500-2009; Moreno-Pedraza, Abigail/J-3683-2017","Rosas Roman, Ignacio Raul/0000-0002-7727-6967; Winkler, Robert/0000-0001-6732-1958; Moreno-Pedraza, Abigail/0000-0001-8228-7663; Guillen Alonso, Hector/0000-0001-5162-0697",CONACyT Fronteras project [2015-2/814]; bilateral grant CONACyT-DFG [2016/277850]; CONACyT,CONACyT Fronteras project; bilateral grant CONACyT-DFG; CONACyT(Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia (CONACyT)),The project was funded by the CONACyT Fronteras project 2015-2/814 and the bilateral grant CONACyT-DFG 2016/277850 to RW.

Starting with the evaluation board of the chip, open-source hardware and software components were integrated into a breadboard prototype. This required modifying the microchip with the breadboard-friendly Arduino Nano board in addition to a data logger and a Bluetooth breakout board. The digitized ECG signal can be transmitted by serial cable, via Bluetooth to a PC, or to an Android smartphone system for visualization. The data logging shield provides gigabytes of storage, as the signal is recorded to a microSD card adapter. A menu incorporates the device's several operating modes. Simulation and testing assessed the system stability and performance parameters in terms of not losing any sample data throughout the length of the recording and finding the maximum sampling frequency; and validation determined and resolved problems that arose in open-source development. Ultimately, a custom printed circuit board was produced requiring advanced manufacturing options of 2.5 mils trace widths for the small package components. The fabricated device did not degrade the AD823X noise performance, and an ECG waveform with negligible distortion was obtained. The maximum number of samples/second was 2380 Hz in serial cable transmission, whereas in microSD recording mode, a continuous ECG signal for up to 36 h at 500 Hz was verified. A low-cost, high-quality portable ECG for long-term monitoring prototype that reasonably complies with electrical safety regulations and medical equipment design was realized.","[Bravo-Zanoguera, Miguel; Cuevas-Gonzalez, Daniel; Garcia-Vazquez, Juan P.; Avitia, Roberto L.] Autonomous Univ Baja California, Engn Fac, Blvd Benito Juarez S-N, Mexicali 21280, BC, Mexico; [Reyna, Marco A.] Autonomous Univ Baja California, Engn Inst, Blvd Benito Juarez S-N, Mexicali 21280, BC, Mexico",Universidad Autonoma de Baja California; Universidad Autonoma de Baja California,"Bravo-Zanoguera, M (corresponding author), Autonomous Univ Baja California, Engn Fac, Blvd Benito Juarez S-N, Mexicali 21280, BC, Mexico.",mbravo@uabc.edu.mx; cuevas.daniel@uabc.edu.mx; mreyna@uabc.edu.mx; pablo.garcia@uabc.edu.mx; ravitia@uabc.edu.mx,"Lopez, Roberto/JGM-0027-2023; Bravo-Zanoguera, Miguel Enrique/ACL-3911-2022; L.

Specifically, this paper reports an impedance sensing probe compatible with cryogenic temperatures and conventional containers in cryopreservation of aquatic species based on printed circuit board technology its characterization in cryopreservation conditions including different sperm extenders (buffer) compositions and concentrations, presence of cryoprotectant, and multiple cooling rates. The developed probe based on printed circuit board (PCB) technology shows a capability of measuring conditions during cryopreservation differentiating among samples with different buffer contents and cryoprotectants. The probe also demonstrates the capability to distinguish different cooling regimes and detect phase change phenomena. This PCB-based sensing platform provides quantitative impedance measurement data during the cryopreservation process at sample preparation, cooling, and while frozen.

We present a hand-held, automatic capillary viscometer, termed Viscopette which can be fabricated simply by assembling globally available mechanical (a stepper motor and an inline pressure sensor), fluidic (a positive-displacement pipette and a cut tubing piece), electronic (an Arduino board) parts in a 3D-printed housing. The Viscopette is specifically designed to improve user experience by adopting how to use commercial micropipettes, and fits within 7.3 cm x 7.3 cm x 38.8 cm (without the cut tubing piece) with an overall weight of 437 g for portable use. By exploiting the high level of controllability of the open-source microcontroller, the Viscopettes enables time-varying shear-rate (or flow-rate) control for viscosity analysis, and simple viscosity measurement by calculating the ratio of a pressure value measured using the inline pressure sensor and a set flow-rate condition. With the advantages of easeof-use, portability, and shear-rate controllability, we demonstrate the Viscopette's ability to accurately analyze Newtonian and non-Newtonian fluids. Our method addresses the unmet need in portable, highperformance viscometers suitable for use as an open-source equipment, which can facilitate on-site, accurate viscosity analysis even by non-expert users.

However, modules in most MR prototypes are large, mechanically complex, expensive, and difficult to manufacture. Soldercubes partially overcome this contradiction through optimizing some components for volume manufacturing processes. With the integration of a soldering connector which weighs only 2 g and has no moving parts, Soldercubes are among the cheapest, lightest and smallest among comparable self-reconfiguring MR systems.

The designed prototype allows remote control, and remote and real-time monitoring of the recorded signals by any internet browser. The system is formed by several Nodes (based on the CC3200 microcontroller of Texas Instruments), which are in charge of digitizing the ambient vibrations registered by three-component seismic sensors and transmitting them to a central server. This server records all the received signals, but also allows their real-time visualization in several remote client browsers thanks to the JavaScript's Node.js technology. The data transmission uses not only Wi-Fi technology, but also the existing network resources that nowadays can be found usually in any official or residential building (lowering deployment costs). A data synchronization scheme was also implemented to correct the time differences between the Nodes, but also the long-term drifts found in the internal clock of the microcontrollers (improving the quality of records). The completed system is a low-cost, open-hardware and open-software design. The prototype was tested in a real building, recording ambient vibrations in several floors and observing the differences due to the building structure.","[Jornet-Monteverde, Julio Antonio; Galiana-Merino, Juan Jose] Univ Alicante, Dept Phys Syst Engn & Signal Theory, Crta San Vicente Del Raspeig S-N, San Vicente Del Raspeig 03080, Spain; [Galiana-Merino, Juan Jose] Univ Alicante, Univ Inst Phys Appl Sci & Technol, Crta San Vicente Del Raspeig S-N, San Vicente Del Raspeig 03080, Spain; [Soler-Llorens, Juan Luis] Univ Alicante, Dept Earth Sci & Environm, Crta San Vicente Del Raspeig S-N, San Vicente Del Raspeig 03080, Spain",Universitat d'Alacant; Universitat d'Alacant; Universitat d'Alacant,"Galiana-Merino, JJ (corresponding author), Univ Alicante, Dept Phys Syst Engn & Signal Theory, Crta San Vicente Del Raspeig S-N, San Vicente Del Raspeig 03080, Spain.; Galiana-Merino, JJ (corresponding author), Univ Alicante, Univ Inst Phys Appl Sci & Technol, Crta San Vicente Del Raspeig S-N, San Vicente Del Raspeig 03080, Spain.",julio.jornet@ua.es; jj.galiana@ua.es; jl.soler@ua.es,"Soler-Llorens, Juan Luis/I-7379-2016; GALIANA-MERINO, JUAN JOSE/L-1948-2014","Soler-Llorens, Juan Luis/0000-0003-4540-8790; JORNET, JULIO/0000-0003-3014-4534; GALIANA-MERINO, JUAN JOSE/0000-0002-0818-2836","European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation program [821046]; Ministerio de Economia, Industria y Competitividad [CGL2016-77688-R]; Conselleria de Participacion, Transparencia, Cooperacion y Calidad Democratica de la Generalitat Valenciana; University of Alicante [VIGROB-116]","European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation program; Ministerio de Economia, Industria y Competitividad; Conselleria de Participacion, Transparencia, Cooperacion y Calidad Democratica de la Generalitat Valenciana; University of Alicante","This study was funded by the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation program under grant agreement No 821046, the Ministerio de Economia, Industria y Competitividad through research project CGL2016-77688-R, by the Conselleria de Participacion, Transparencia, Cooperacion y Calidad Democratica de la Generalitat Valenciana, and by Research Group VIGROB-116 (University of Alicante).",,41,14,14,2,14,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,1424-8220,,SENSORS-BASEL,Sensors,JUN,2021,21,11,,,,,,,3875,10.3390/s21113875,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/s21113875,,,26,"Chemistry, Analytical; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Instruments & Instrumentation",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Chemistry; Engineering; Instruments & Instrumentation,SQ9OM,34199758,"Green Published, gold",,,8/15/24,WOS:000660677200001,,0,315,,,

This damage occurred 3 days before the challenge. An entirely new working mobile platform was built from scratch using a low-cost chassis. It was able to compete with the other participants in the challenge and achieved various tasks (similar to 83% of the tasks completed by the best performer). The paper provides a complete description of the work carried out and the system used during the competition. The development was based on low-cost solutions, in particular: Adoption of open-hardware and open-software technology, providing cheap and fast-prototyping solutions. Use of smartphones, allowing sophisticated sensors to be exploited in an affordable way. Employment of Cloud infrastructures, to reduce the computational burden of offloading heavy processes. Results of this experience represent a concrete demonstration, showing that even low-cost solutions can achieve complex tasks, such as those required for the European robotic competition. The presented lessons learned aim to provide guidelines useful for reacting to unexpected events.

The presented approach employs the Whipple model for the kinematic and inverse dynamic simulation of a bicycle ride using as an input three generalized coordinates registered with digital sensors. During the experimental phase, students ride the instrumented bicycle to collect the necessary sensor data. The kinematic and inverse dynamic simulations based on these signals provide a full picture of the motion of the system in different positions and at a range of velocities and accelerations. In addition, they estimate the traction, control, and tire-to-road contact forces during the ride. To validate the simulated results, the simulated velocity and accelerations are compared with the data acquired with an inertial measurement unit (IMU) installed on the bicycle. The paper describes the experimental setup of the instrumented bicycle, enabling readers to build the very same system for their own educational use.

The posit number system composed of a run-time varying exponent component, which is defined by a composition of varying length ""regime-bit"" and ""exponent-bit"" (with a maximum size of ES bits, the exponent size). This in effect also makes the fraction part to vary at run-time in size and position. These run-time variations inherit an interesting hardware design challenge for posit arithmetic architectures. The posit number system, being at an infant stage of its development, possess very limited hardware solutions for its arithmetic architectures. In this view, this paper targets the algorithmic development and generic HDL generators (PACoGen) for basic posit arithmetic. The proposed open source PACoGen currently includes the adder/subtractor, multiplier, and division arithmetic. The PACoGen can provide the Verilog HDL code respective posit arithmetic for any given posit word width (N) and exponent size (ES), as defined under the posit number system. Further, pipelined architectures of 32-bit posit with 6-bit exponent size are also proposed and discussed for addition/subtraction, multiplication, and division arithmetic. The proposed posit arithmetic architectures are demonstrated on the Virtex-7 (xc7vx330t-3ffg1157) FPGA device as well as Nangate 15 nm ASIC platform.

We propose an intuitive yet elegant design for a 3D-printed digital pipette designed for robots to carry out chemical experiments. It costs less than 200 USD, and the simple design with three parts enables a new user to assemble one in 10 minutes. We conducted a performance evaluation that closely followed ISO 8655-6. Our results show that robots with the digital pipette could conduct accurate liquid delivery with 0.2% random error for the nominal volume (10 mL). This performance is comparable to commercially available liquid handling devices, whose typical random errors are 0.3%. We propose an economical 3D-printed pipette, which aims to overcome the limitations of two-finger robot grippers. It enables general-purpose robot arms to achieve high precision in liquid transfer tasks that is comparable to commercial devices.","[Yoshikawa, Naruki; Darvish, Kourosh; Vakili, Mohammad Ghazi; Garg, Animesh; Aspuru-Guzik, Alan] Univ Toronto, Toronto, ON M5S 1A1, Canada; [Yoshikawa, Naruki; Darvish, Kourosh; Garg, Animesh; Aspuru-Guzik, Alan] Vector Inst Artificial Intelligence, Toronto, ON M5G 1M1, Canada; [Aspuru-Guzik, Alan] Canadian Inst Adv Res CIFAR, Toronto, ON M5G 1M1, Canada",University of Toronto; Vector Institute for Artificial Intelligence; Canadian Institute for Advanced Research (CIFAR),"Yoshikawa, N; Garg, A; Aspuru-Guzik, A (corresponding author), Univ Toronto, Toronto, ON M5S 1A1, Canada.; Yoshikawa, N; Garg, A; Aspuru-Guzik, A (corresponding author), Vector Inst Artificial Intelligence, Toronto, ON M5G 1M1, Canada.; Aspuru-Guzik, A (corresponding author), Canadian Inst Adv Res CIFAR, Toronto, ON M5G 1M1, Canada.",naruki.yoshikawa@mail.utoronto.ca; garg@cs.toronto.edu; alan@aspuru.com,"Garg, Animesh/AGK-2223-2022; Aspuru-Guzik, Alan/A-4984-2008","Garg, Animesh/0000-0003-0482-4296; Aspuru-Guzik, Alan/0000-0002-8277-4434; Yoshikawa, Naruki/0000-0003-1546-8709; Ghazi Vakili, mohammad/0000-0002-2927-4975; Darvish, Kourosh/0000-0003-4984-432X",Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada [IRCPJ 547644-18]; NSERC-Google Industrial Research Chair Award,Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada(Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)CGIAR); NSERC-Google Industrial Research Chair Award,"We thank the Acceleration Consortium for financial support, Sebastian Arellano-Rubach and Kevin Angers for helping with graphics, and Florian Shkurti for the useful discussions.

Low-cost sensors open the possibility of monitoring storm and waste water systems at a much greater spatial and temporal resolution without prohibitive costs and resource investment. To aid in this, this work developed a low-cost, low-power velocity sensor based on acoustic Doppler velocimetry. The sensor, costing less than 50 USD is open-source, open-hardware, compact, and easily interfaceable to a wide range of data-logging systems. A freely available sensor design at this price point does not currently exist, and its novelty is in enabling high-resolution real-time monitoring schemes. The design is capable of measuring water velocities up to 1200 mm/s. The sensor is characterised and then verified in an in-field long-term test. Finally, the data from this test are then used to evaluate the performance of the sensor in a real-world scenario.

A total of 122 participants-healthy and diagnosed with type 2 diabetes-were invited to be part of this study. The entire set of participants was divided into two partitions: a training subset of 72 participants, which was intended for model selection, and a validation subset comprising the remaining 50 participants, to test the selected model. A 3D-printed chamber for providing a light-controlled environment and a low-cost microcontroller unit were used to acquire optical measurements. The MFCC, PCA and ICA were calculated by an open-hardware computing platform. The glucose levels estimated by the system were compared to actual glucose concentrations measured by venipuncture in a laboratory test, using the mean absolute error, the mean absolute percentage error and the Clarke error grid for this purpose.

Depending on the number of samples to be analyzed, conventional processing of each FFPE block separately can be laborious or impracticable. This effort can be drastically reduced by using tissue microarrays (TMAs). TMAs have a wide range of applications and can be considered as a high-throughput method to process up to hundreds of miniaturized tissue samples simultaneously on a single microscopy slide, in order to reduce labor, costs and sample consumption, and to increase results comparability. Several commercial and self-made solutions to fabricate TMAs with varying degrees of automation are available. However, these solutions may not be suitable for every situation, either due to high costs, high complexity, lack of precision or lack of flexibility, especially when diagnostically oriented pathology institutes or laboratories with constrained resources are considered. This article introduces the TMA-Mate, an open-source 3D printable modular toolkit for constructing high-density TMAs of arbitrary layouts, providing an affordable, lightweight, and accessible procedure to implement TMAs into existing histology processing pipelines. Step-by-step demonstrations for replicating the hardware and constructing TMAs are included.& COPY; 2023 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

The high -resolution scaffolds produced by MEW have been primarily used for tissue engineering, cancer research, bio-fabrication and biomaterials. Unfortunately, the commercial MEW device's prohibitive affordability and lack of standardization of custom devices, represent obstacles to further research. Built on the achievements and affordability of material extrusion 3D printers, we convert an open-source Voron 0.1 printer into a highly capable MEW device, termed as MEWron. To guarantee availability, the use of commercial and affordable components is prioritized, while in the cases where this has not been possible, 3D printed, and easy-to-machine components have been employed. Two main approaches have been followed, the first one focused on the existing material extrusion configuration (i.e., filament-based feeding system and material input) while the second one focuses on a conventional MEW pneumatic feeding system and syringe reservoir. When not including the high voltage supply, both approaches have a final budget below $1000. The manuscript describes all required steps and components to modify a Voron 0.1 printer and provides the computer-aided design (CAD) for required custom components reproduction. Moreover, the MEWron devices' reliability is demonstrated, as well as their potential to extend the MEW field boundaries. We believe that the open-source MEWron device will facilitate unprece-dented MEW technology accessibility using a well-established and modifiable platform.","[Reizabal, Ander; Kangur, Taavet; Saiz, Paula G.; Menke, Sonke; Dalton, Paul D.; Luposchainsky, Simon] Univ Oregon, Phil & Penny Knight Campus Accelerating Sci Impact, 1505 Franklin Blvd, Eugene, OR 97403 USA; [Reizabal, Ander] BCMaterials, Basque Ctr Mat Applicat & Nanostruct, Bldg Martina Casiano, UPV-EHU Sci Pk, Barrio Sarri, Leioa 48940, Spain; [Kangur, Taavet; Moser, Christophe; Brugger, Juergen] Ecole Polytech Fed Lausanne, Lab Appl Photon Devices, CH-1015 Lausanne, Switzerland; [Saiz, Paula G.] Univ Basque Country UPV EHU, Fac Sci & Technol, Dept Phys Chem, Macromol Chem Res Grp LABQUIMAC, Bilbao, Spain",University of Oregon; BCMaterials; Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; Ecole Polytechnique Federale de Lausanne; University of Basque Country,"Dalton, PD; Luposchainsky, S (corresponding author), Univ Oregon, Phil & Penny Knight Campus Accelerating Sci Impact, 1505 Franklin Blvd, Eugene, OR 97403 USA.",pdalton@uoregon.edu; slupo@uoregon.edu,"Luposchainsky, Simon/HIK-3307-2022; Moser, Christophe/ABF-3174-2020; G.

Results: We developed a novel deep learning-based root extraction method that leverages the latest advances in convolutional neural networks for image segmentation and incorporates temporal consistency into the root system architecture reconstruction process. Automatic extraction of phenotypic parameters from sequences of images allowed a comprehensive characterization of the root system growth dynamics. Furthermore, novel time-associated parameters emerged from the analysis of spectral features derived from temporal signals. Conclusions: Our work shows that the combination of machine intelligence methods and a 3D-printed device expands the possibilities of root high-throughput phenotyping for genetics and natural variation studies, as well as the screening of clock-related mutants, revealing novel root traits.","[Gaggion, Nicolas; Milone, Diego H.; Ferrante, Enzo] Univ Nacl Litoral, FICH, CONICET, Res Inst Signals Syst & Computat Intelligence Sin, Santa Fe, Argentina; [Ariel, Federico; Camoirano, Alejandra] Univ Nacl Litoral, FBCB, CONICET, Inst Agrobiotecnol Litoral IAL, Colectora Ruta Nacl 168 Km 0, Santa Fe, Argentina; [Daric, Vladimir; Lambert, Eric; Legendre, Simon; Roule, Thomas; Crespi, Martin; Blein, Thomas] Univ Paris Saclay, INRA, CNRS, Inst Plant Sci Paris Saclay IPS2, Batiment 630, F-91192 Gif Sur Yvette, France; [Daric, Vladimir; Lambert, Eric; Legendre, Simon; Roule, Thomas; Crespi, Martin; Blein, Thomas] Univ Paris, Batiment 630, F-91192 Gif Sur Yvette, France",Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Cientificas y Tecnicas (CONICET); National University of the Littoral; Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Cientificas y Tecnicas (CONICET); National University of the Littoral; Universite Paris Cite; Universite Paris Saclay; INRAE; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Universite Paris Cite,"Ferrante, E (corresponding author), Univ Nacl Litoral, FICH, CONICET, Res Inst Signals Syst & Computat Intelligence Sin, Santa Fe, Argentina.; Blein, T (corresponding author), Univ Paris Saclay, INRA, CNRS, Inst Plant Sci Paris Saclay IPS2, Batiment 630, F-91192 Gif Sur Yvette, France.; Blein, T (corresponding author), Univ Paris, Batiment 630, F-91192 Gif Sur Yvette, France.",thomas.blein@ips2.universite-paris-saclay.fr; eferrante@sinc.unl.edu.ar,"Roule, Thomas/GRE-6111-2022; Lambert, Eric/KOC-9728-2024; Ferrante, Enzo/AAU-6518-2020; Crespi, Martin/AAB-1424-2020; Ariel, Federico/AAU-6726-2020; Milone, Diego/A-5678-2015","Crespi, Martin/0000-0002-5698-9482; Ariel, Federico/0000-0001-8478-8808; Camoirano, Alejandra/0000-0002-9929-287X; DARIC, Vladimir/0000-0002-2479-3784; Milone, Diego/0000-0003-2182-4351; Roule, Thomas/0000-0001-6661-9357; Blein, Thomas/0000-0001-9788-5201","French State (Saclay Plant Sciences) [ANR-17-EUR-0007, ANR-11IDEX-0003-02]; CNRS through the MITI interdisciplinary programs; AXA Research Fund; ANPCyT [PICT 2018-3384, PICT2018-3907]; UNL [CAI+D 50220140100084LI, 50620190100145LI]; CNRS (Laboratoire International Associe NOCOSYM)",French State (Saclay Plant Sciences); CNRS through the MITI interdisciplinary programs; AXA Research Fund(AXA Research Fund); ANPCyT(ANPCyT); UNL; CNRS (Laboratoire International Associe NOCOSYM),"This work was supported by grants from French State (Saclay Plant Sciences, reference No. ANR-17-EUR-0007, EUR SPS-GSR) managed by the French National Research Agency under an Investments for the Future program (reference No. ANR-11IDEX-0003-02) to V.D., T.R., M.C., and T.B.; CNRS through the MITI interdisciplinary programs to T.B.; AXA Research Fund, ANPCyT (PICT2018-3907) and UNL (CAI+D 50220140100084LI and 50620190100145LI) to E.F.; ANPCyT (PICT2019-04137) to F.A.; ANPCyT (PICT 2018-3384) to DM.; and CNRS (Laboratoire International Associ ' e NOCOSYM) to M.C. and F.A.",,61,18,19,5,39,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",2047-217X,,,GIGASCIENCE,GigaScience,JUL,2021,10,7,,,,,,,giab052,10.1093/gigascience/giab052,http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/gigascience/giab052,,,15,Biology; Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Life Sciences & Biomedicine - Other Topics; Science & Technology - Other Topics,2A8TW,34282452,"Green Published, Green Submitted, gold",,,8/15/24,WOS:000809769200003,,0,330,,,

To this end, it provides an easily usable task-based programming abstraction, and combines this with powerful tool support to automatically implement the individual hardware accelerators and integrate them into usable system-on-chips. Currently, TaPaSCo relies on the host to manage task parallelism and perform the actual task launches. However, for more expressive parallel programming patterns, such as pipelines of task farms, the round trips from the hardware accelerators back to the host for launching child tasks, especially when exploiting data-dependent execution times, quickly add up. The major contribution of this work is the addition of on-chip task scheduling and launching capabilities to TaPaSCo. This enables not only low-latency dynamic task parallelism, it also encompasses the efficient on-chip exchange of parameter values and task results between parent and child accelerator tasks. For larger distributed systems, the dynamic launch capability can even be extended over the network to span multiple FPGAs. Our solution is able to handle recursive task structures, and is shown to achieve latency reductions of over 35x compared to the prior approaches.","[Heinz, Carsten; Koch, Andreas] Tech Univ Darmstadt, Embedded Syst & Applicat Grp, Darmstadt, Germany",Technical University of Darmstadt,"Heinz, C (corresponding author), Tech Univ Darmstadt, Embedded Syst & Applicat Grp, Darmstadt, Germany.",heinz@esa.tu-darmstadt.de; koch@esa.tu-darmstadt.de,,"Heinz, Carsten/0000-0001-5927-4426",German Federal Ministry for Education and Research (BMBF) [01 IS 17091 B.],German Federal Ministry for Education and Research (BMBF)(Federal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF)),This research was funded by the German Federal Ministry for Education and Research (BMBF) in project 01 IS 17091 B.,,18,1,1,0,0,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",1939-8018,1939-8115,,J SIGNAL PROCESS SYS,J.

WMSNs applications produce large amount of data, which require high transmission rates. An efficient and seamless delivery of multimedia services in WMSNs is still a challenging task. This article proposes an intelligent video surveillance platform (IVSP) for wireless multimedia sensor networks. IVSP presents the design of a networked system for joint rate control and error control of video over resource-constrained embedded devices. First, a combination of two different congestion indicators is introduced to differentiate between congestion levels and handle them accordingly. Second, a feedback-based rate controller is developed to maximize received video quality, in which sensor nodes can adaptively adjust their sending rates. Finally, a different retransmission mechanism for different packets is proposed. Lost packets can be stored temporarily and resend when free channel is available to avoid congestion. The core component of IVSP is an open source hardware platform, which is based on Raspberry Pi sensor nodes. IVSP is extensively evaluated on 7 Raspberry Pi sensor nodes. We present the results of 7-node real-world deployment of IVSP in a video surveillance application and show that it works well in long-term deployments.","[Abbas, Nasim; Yu, Fengqi; Fan, Yang] Chinese Acad Sci, Shenzhen Inst Adv Technol, Shenzhen 518055, Peoples R China; [Abbas, Nasim; Yu, Fengqi; Fan, Yang] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China","Chinese Academy of Sciences; Shenzhen Institute of Advanced Technology, CAS; Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, CAS","Yu, FQ (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Shenzhen Inst Adv Technol, Shenzhen 518055, Peoples R China.; Yu, FQ (corresponding author), Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China.",abbas.nasim@siat.ac.cn; fq.yu@siat.ac.cn; yangfan1@siat.ac.cn,"Fan, Yang/J-1246-2016",,"National key RD plan [2016YFC0105002, 61674162]; Shenzhen Key Lab for RF Integrated Circuits; Shenzhen Shared Technology Service Center for Internet of Things; Guangdong government [2013S046, 2015B010104005]; Shenzhen government [JCYJ20160331192843950]; Shenzhen Peacock Plan",National key RD plan; Shenzhen Key Lab for RF Integrated Circuits; Shenzhen Shared Technology Service Center for Internet of Things; Guangdong government; Shenzhen government; Shenzhen Peacock Plan,"This work was supported in part by National key R&D plan (Grant number 2016YFC0105002 and 61674162), Shenzhen Key Lab for RF Integrated Circuits, Shenzhen Shared Technology Service Center for Internet of Things, Guangdong government funds (Grant numbers 2013S046 and 2015B010104005), Shenzhen government funds (Grant numbers JCYJ20160331192843950), and Shenzhen Peacock Plan.",,42,16,17,1,26,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2076-3417,,APPL SCI-BASEL,Appl.

It is based upon a single-degree-of-freedom potentiometer fader coupled to a DC motor, also known as a ""motorized fader."" A light is connected in parallel with the motor to help communicate the force's strength visually. The FireFader consists of only open-source hardware and open-source software elements. Consequently, it is relatively easy for users to repurpose it into new projects involving varying kinds and numbers of motors and sensors. An open-source device driver for the FireFader allows it to be linked to a computer via USB so that the computer can perform the feedback control calculations. For example, the computer can simulate the acoustics of a virtual musical instrument to concurrently synthesize sound and calculate the motor force as a function of the fader position. The serial connection over USB increases the latency of the control signal compared to embedded implementations, but the serial connection facilitates easier programming via the computer, and the force feedback can be automatically disabled when the user is not touching the fader. Some new devices derived from the FireFader design are presented.","[Berdahl, Edgar] Tech Univ Berlin, Sekretariat EN 8, Audio Commun Grp, D-10587 Berlin, Germany; [Kontogeorgakopoulos, Alexandros] Cardiff Metropolitan Univ, Cardiff Sch Art & Design, Cardiff CF5 2YB, S Glam, Wales",Technical University of Berlin; Cardiff Metropolitan University,"Berdahl, E (corresponding author), Tech Univ Berlin, Sekretariat EN 8, Audio Commun Grp, Einsteinufer 17C, D-10587 Berlin, Germany.",eberdahl@mail.tu-berlin.de; akontogeorgakopoulos@cardiffmet.ac.uk,,,Alexander von Humboldt Foundation,Alexander von Humboldt Foundation(Alexander von Humboldt Foundation),"The authors would like to thank the Alexander von Humboldt Foundation for supporting this work and would like to acknowledge the researchers who have influenced, motivated, and enabled this work, including Bill Verplank, Claude Cadoz, Stefan Weinzierl, Jean-Loup Florens, Annie Luciani, and Chris Chafe.",,36,15,21,0,3,MIT PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"ONE ROGERS ST, CAMBRIDGE, MA 02142-1209 USA",0148-9267,1531-5169,,COMPUT MUSIC J,Comput.

Sensor-management systems typically perform three fundamental tasks: sample sensors at a specified time or period, save data onto retrievable media, and switch power to components on and off in between sample cycles to conserve battery energy and increase field operation time. These tasks are commonly accomplished through integrating separate off-the-shelf components into the desired system such as: power relays, SD card hardware, Real-Time Clocks (RTCs), and coin cell batteries. To enable faster prototyping, the Openly Published Environmental Sensing Lab abstracted all of these requirements into a single printed circuit board (PCB), Hypnos, that can be included in any project to achieve these commonly-required capabilities: powering on and off connected sensors on a schedule and logging collected data to the removable SD card. The hardware is laid out in a ""Feather"" form factor, a popular configuration in the open-source hardware community, to easily mate with other industry standard products. The onboard RTC acts as an alarm clock that wakes a user-attached microprocessor from low-power sleep modes in between sample cycles. By integrating all these components into a single PCB, we save cost while significantly reducing physical system size. The design as well as a suite of code functions that enable the user to configure all the Hypnos board features are detailed. (C) 2021 The Authors.

The NRCP system consists of a PC controller equipped with MATLAB/Simulink software and an embedded target designed with open-source hardware, e.g., Raspberry Pi and STM32. Therefore, it benefits from the following advantages, such as simple structure, low cost, convenient deployment, and robust scalability. In order to verify the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed NRCP, a networked magnetic levitation control system (NMLCS) is developed on the basis of this NRCP system. Furthermore, a discrete-time equivalent-input-disturbance (DEID)-based model predictive control approach is proposed for NMLCS to deal with the common practical issues in NCSs, such as time delay and disturbance. Specifically, the time delay is modeled as delay-induced disturbance (DID), whose influence is effectively estimated and eliminated by the designed controller. Several experimental case studies are performed to verify the effectiveness of the NRCP, the DEID-based control algorithm, and the analytical method of DID.","[Huang, Guangpu; Wu, Xiang; Guo, Fanghong; Yu, Li; Zhang, Wen-An] Zhejiang Univ Technol, Coll Informat Engn, Hangzhou 310023, Peoples R China; [Huang, Guangpu; Wu, Xiang; Guo, Fanghong; Yu, Li; Zhang, Wen-An] Zhejiang Prov United Key Lab Embedded Syst, Hangzhou 310023, Peoples R China",Zhejiang University of Technology,"Wu, X (corresponding author), Zhejiang Univ Technol, Coll Informat Engn, Hangzhou 310023, Peoples R China.",1111703014@zjut.edu.cn; xiangwu@zjut.edu.cn; fhguo@zjut.edu.cn; lyu@zjut.edu.cn; wazhang@zjut.edu.cn,"wang, xin/JWA-3772-2024; wang, shuo/KCL-3379-2024; Wu, Xiang/ABD-2222-2022","Yu, Li/0000-0003-3889-3863; Zhang, Wen-An/0000-0002-4355-2783","Natural Science Foundation of Zhejiang Province [LQ22F030015, LD21F030002]; NSFC-Zhejiang Joint Foundation for the Integration of Industrialization and Informatization [U1709213]; Key Research and Development Program of Zhejiang Province [2020C01109]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [61903333]",Natural Science Foundation of Zhejiang Province(Natural Science Foundation of Zhejiang Province); NSFC-Zhejiang Joint Foundation for the Integration of Industrialization and Informatization; Key Research and Development Program of Zhejiang Province; National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),"This work was supported in part by the Natural Science Foundation of Zhejiang Province under Grant LQ22F030015 and Grant LD21F030002, in part by the NSFC-Zhejiang Joint Foundation for the Integration of Industrialization and Informatization under Grant U1709213, in part by the Key Research and Development Program of Zhejiang Province under Grant 2020C01109, and in part by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant 61903333.",,35,7,7,7,55,IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC,PISCATAWAY,"445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA",0278-0046,1557-9948,,IEEE T IND ELECTRON,IEEE Trans.

From a technical point of view, the use of compound parabolic collectors (CPC) has been consolidated in the last decades. However, the relatively high cost of tooling conventional manufacturing processes for these collectors makes them difficult to afford in the most impoverished regions. This work presents the development of low-cost CPC and parabolic through solar collectors (PTC) by 3D printing of the structure and the use of recycled reflective materials. Besides, open-source hardware has been used to control system operation, including a supplementary UV LED system to compensate for the operation under low solar irradiance. Regarding the tested reflective materials, an optimum is obtained using an aluminium adhesive sheet that leads to an efficiency of 80% compared to a commercial CPC made of high-quality anodised aluminium, being the cost 20 times lower. On the other hand, incorporating a low-cost solar tracking system in a printed PTC reactor could lead to efficiencies up to 300% compared to the commercial CPC, while the cost was 4.5 times lower. Finally, the LED compensation system was successfully validated, allowing the operation with a constant treatment capacity during operation in cloudy conditions.

Despite the simplicity of this technique the entry price for such machines might be prohibitive, ranging from few hundreds to thousands of Euros. Here we present Maasi, an affordable alternative that is easy to build and has all functional key features to be used in a wide range of applications. Our design has a price of less than hundred Euros and an assembly time of only two hours. One of the key design principles was to use only 3D printed parts in combination with affordable Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) components [1]. Reducing the complexity we use an electronic speed controller (ESC) with telemetry, to eliminate the need for a rotor position sensor [2]. A touchscreen further improves its usability, thus setting a perfect startpoint for the design of other affordable lab tools. The Maasi project includes different 3D printable substrate holders allowing treatment of formats up to 80 mm in diameter. We furthermore validate the Maasi spin coater by measuring its speed accuracy and performance for coating polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) on glass coverslips for mechanobiological assays.

The goal of this work was to develop a simple (single-piece and single-layer photolithography) sperm counting chamber (SSCC) for aquatic species. Goldfish (Carassius auratus) and zebrafish (Danio rerio) sperm were used for evaluation in the device, which was created with soft lithography. Four designs with different geometries were evaluated for counting accuracy. Open-corner and open-midpoint designs were the most accurate with no significant differences (P > 0.05) for most of the target sperm concentrations (0.5-1.0 x 10(8) cells/mL). The open-corner design was not significantly different from the Makler (R) counting chamber intended for human sperm cells (P = 0.6) but was significantly different from a hemocytometer (P < 0.001) intended for other cell sizes. Material cost of device production was USD 16 per unit, including photolithography supplies, glass slide and coverslip, and polydimethylsiloxane. The cost can be reduced to USD 2 per unit with repeated wafer casts. This device could be further refined for resin 3-D printing and sharing via open-hardware approaches and modified to best suit species specific applications.","[Belgodere, Jorge A.; Liu, Yue; Reich, Elizabeth L.; Eades, Jason; Monroe, William Todd] Louisiana State Univ, Dept Biol & Agr Engn, Baton Rouge, LA 70803 USA; [Belgodere, Jorge A.; Liu, Yue; Reich, Elizabeth L.; Eades, Jason; Monroe, William Todd] Agr Ctr, Baton Rouge, LA 70803 USA; [Liu, Yue; Tiersch, Terrence R.] Louisiana State Univ, Aquat Germplasm & Genet Resources Ctr, Sch Renewable Nat Resources, Agr Ctr, Baton Rouge, LA 70820 USA",Louisiana State University System; Louisiana State University; Louisiana State University System; Louisiana State University,"Monroe, WT (corresponding author), Louisiana State Univ, Dept Biol & Agr Engn, Baton Rouge, LA 70803 USA.; Monroe, WT (corresponding author), Agr Ctr, Baton Rouge, LA 70803 USA.",tmonroe@lsu.edu,"Eades, Jason/HLG-7394-2023","Monroe, William Todd/0000-0002-7889-3799; Liu, Yue/0000-0003-3838-8277; Belgodere, Jorge/0000-0003-3399-4796; Tiersch, Terrence/0000-0002-7738-1978","National Institutes of Health, Office of Research Infrastructure Programs [R24-OD010441, R24-OD028443]; National Institute of Food and Agriculture, United States Department of Agriculture [LAB94420, NC1194]; United States Agency for International Development [193900.312455.19]; Louisiana Sea Grant Undergraduate Research Opportunity Program (UROP); Louisiana State University Discover Undergraduate Research Grant; Louisiana State University Research & Technology Foundation (LIFT2); LSU-ACRES (Audubon Center for Research of Endangered Species) Collaborative Program; USDA-NAGP-AGGRC Cooperative Agreement [583012-8-006]; NIH Office of the Director [R24OD010441] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER","National Institutes of Health, Office of Research Infrastructure Programs; National Institute of Food and Agriculture, United States Department of Agriculture(United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)); United States Agency for International Development(United States Agency for International Development (USAID)); Louisiana Sea Grant Undergraduate Research Opportunity Program (UROP); Louisiana State University Discover Undergraduate Research Grant; Louisiana State University Research & Technology Foundation (LIFT2); LSU-ACRES (Audubon Center for Research of Endangered Species) Collaborative Program; USDA-NAGP-AGGRC Cooperative Agreement; NIH Office of the Director(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH Office of the Director)","This work was supported in part by funding from the National Institutes of Health, Office of Research Infrastructure Programs (R24-OD010441 and R24-OD028443), with additional support provided by National Institute of Food and Agriculture, United States Department of Agriculture (Hatch project LAB94420 and NC1194), a USDA-NAGP-AGGRC Cooperative Agreement (Award 583012-8-006), United States Agency for International Development (193900.312455.19), Louisiana Sea Grant Undergraduate Research Opportunity Program (UROP), Louisiana State University Discover Undergraduate Research Grant, Louisiana State University Research & Technology Foundation (LIFT2), and LSU-ACRES (Audubon Center for Research of Endangered Species) Collaborative Program.",,47,4,4,0,5,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2410-3888,,FISHES-BASEL,Fishes,OCT,2022,7,5,,,,,,,231,10.3390/fishes7050231,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/fishes7050231,,,14,Fisheries; Marine & Freshwater Biology,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Fisheries; Marine & Freshwater Biology,5O4MW,36644608,"gold, Green Accepted",,,8/15/24,WOS:000872450600001,,0,340,,,

Widespread field testing for nitrate could begin to address the nitrate pollution problem, however, the Cadmium Reduction Method, the leading certified method to detect and quantify nitrate, demands the use of a toxic heavy metal. An alternative, the recently proposed Environmental Protection Agency Nitrate Reductase Nitrate-Nitrogen Analysis Method, eliminates this problem but requires an expensive proprietary spectrophotometer. The development of an inexpensive portable, handheld photometer will greatly expedite field nitrate analysis to combat pollution. To accomplish this goal, a methodology for the design, development, and technical validation of an improved open-source water testing platform capable of performing Nitrate Reductase Nitrate-Nitrogen Analysis Method. This approach is evaluated for its potential to i) eliminate the need for toxic chemicals in water testing for nitrate and nitrite, ii) reduce the cost of equipment to perform this method for measurement for water quality, and iii) make the method easier to carryout in the field. The device is able to perform as well as commercial proprietary systems for less than 15% of the cost for materials.

In this paper, we describe a new wireless controller that is adapted to liquid manipulation tasks, in particular when combined with the proposed 3D-printed pumps. It can be built from widely available electronic components and managed with open-source software. The use of peristaltic pumps enables to move volumes from milliliters to liters with a relative error below 1% or a syringe pump capable of injecting volumes in the range of milliliters with microliter accuracy. The system is remotely controllable over WiFi and easily automated using the MQTT communication protocol. The programming of the microcontroller is performed on the Arduino IDE. The WiFi settings and the calibration value can be easily modified, stored and exported in the form of a JSON file to create a user friendly, plug and play and easily scalable device. Additional sensors or actuators can be added, allowing the system to adapt to various usages. Finally, in addition to its low manufacturing cost and its capability to fit a large variety of tasks involving liquid handling, our system has been specifically designed for research environments where adaptability and repeatability of experiments is essential.

Here the author describes the use of open-source software and open hardware design to build a deconvolution microscope at low cost, using readily available software and hardware. The advantage of this method is its cost-effectiveness and ability to construct a microscope system using commercially available optical components and open-source software.

This thermal situation has important consequences for animal behavior. The explanation is based on the fact that the relationship between the body area of the small animal and that of the adult, gives a greater value than the relationship between the respective volumes.

Although there have been a large number of works done in the field of traffic data collection, there are several barriers which restrict the collection of traffic data at higher resolution in the cities. Installation and maintenance costs can act as a disincentive to use existing methods (e.g., loop detectors, video analysis) at a large scale and hence limit their deployment to only a few roads of the city. This paper presents an approach for vehicle counting using a low cost, simple and easily installable system. In the proposed system, vehicles (i.e., bicycles, cars, trucks) are counted by means of variations in the WiFi signals. Experiments with the developed hardware in two different scenarios-low traffic (i.e., 400 objects) and heavy traffic roads (i.e., 1000 objects)-demonstrate its ability to detect cars and trucks. The system can be used to provide estimates of vehicle numbers for streets not covered by official traffic monitoring techniques in future smart cities.","[Gupta, Shivam; Hamzin, Albert; Degbelo, Auriol] Westfalische Wilhelms Univ, Inst Geoinformat, D-48149 Munster, Germany",University of Munster,"Gupta, S (corresponding author), Westfalische Wilhelms Univ, Inst Geoinformat, D-48149 Munster, Germany.",shivam.gupta@uni-muenster.de; albert.hamzin@uni-muenster.de; degbelo@uni-muenster.de,"Gupta, Shivam/JNE-3789-2023; Gupta, Shivam/E-2555-2016; Degbelo, Auriol/H-6349-2019","Gupta, Shivam/0000-0002-1450-5435; Degbelo, Auriol/0000-0001-5087-8776; Hamzin, Albert/0000-0001-6096-4707",H2020-MSCA-ITN-2014 grant [642332],H2020-MSCA-ITN-2014 grant,This research was funded by H2020-MSCA-ITN-2014 grant number 642332.,,47,7,7,1,2,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,1424-8220,,SENSORS-BASEL,Sensors,NOV,2018,18,11,,,,,,,3623,10.3390/s18113623,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/s18113623,,,22,"Chemistry, Analytical; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Instruments & Instrumentation",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Chemistry; Engineering; Instruments & Instrumentation,HC1YJ,30366415,"Green Published, gold, Green Submitted",,,8/15/24,WOS:000451598900033,,0,348,,,

Output voltages, corresponding to typical behaviors on the captive HS, such as stopping (A), rolling (B), flapping (C), and sliding (D), are clearly obtained, and their analytical interpretation on captured electrical signals are fully validated via a comparison study with consecutively captured images for each motion of the HS.

The device provides an easy, low-cost, and powerful tool for research on plant water relations and gas exchange. Here, we describe in detail how to construct and operate this device to estimate embolism resistance of angiosperm xylem, and how to analyse pneumatic data. Simple and more elaborated ways of constructing a Pneumatron are shown, either using wires, a breadboard, or a printed circuit board. The instrument is based on an open-source hardware and software system, which allows users to operate it in an automated or semi-automated way. A step-by-step manual and a troubleshooting section are provided. An excel spreadsheet and an R-script are also presented for fast and easy data analysis. This manual aims at helping users to avoid common mistakes, such as unstable measurements of the minimum and maximum amount of gas discharged from xylem tissue, which has major consequences for estimating embolism resistance. Major advantages of the Pneumatron device include its automated and accurate measurements of gas diffusion rates, including highly precise measurements of the gas volume in intact, embolised conduits.

The EyeTrackers and Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs) are suitable systems for those people but their main drawback is their cost. More affordable devices are capable of detecting voluntary blinks and translating them into a binary signal that allows the selection, for example, of an ideogram on a communication board. We tested four different systems based on infrared, bioelectrical signals (Electro-Oculography (EOG) and Electro-Encephalography (EEG)), and video processing. The experiments were performed by people with/without disabilities and analyzed the systems' performances, usability, and method of voluntary blinking (long blinks or sequence of two short blinks). The best accuracy (99.3%) was obtained using Infrared-Oculography (IR-OG) and the worst with the EEG headset (85.9%) and there was a statistical influence of the technology on accuracy. Regarding the method of voluntary blinking, the use of long or double blinks had no statistical influence on accuracy, excluding EOG, and the time taken to perform double blinks was shorter, resulting in a potentially much faster interface. People with disabilities obtained similar values but with greater variability. The preferred technology and blinking methods were Video-Oculography (VOG) and long blinks, respectively. The several Open-Source Hardware (MEW) devices have been developed and a new algorithm for detecting voluntary blinks has also been proposed, which outperforms most of the published papers in the reviewed literature.","[Molina-Cantero, Alberto J.; Lebrato-Vazquez, Clara; Merino-Monge, Manuel; Quesada-Tabares, Roylan; Castro-Garcia, Juan A.; Gomez-Gonzalez, Isabel M.] Univ Seville, ETS Ingn Informat, Dept Elect Technol, E-41012 Seville, Spain",University of Sevilla,"Molina-Cantero, AJ (corresponding author), Univ Seville, ETS Ingn Informat, Dept Elect Technol, E-41012 Seville, Spain.",almolina@us.es,"Molina, Alberto/L-6399-2014; Merino-Monge, Manuel/S-1209-2018; Castro-Garc√≠a, Juan Antonio/P-7406-2016; G√≥mez-Gonz√°lez, Isabel M./L-5957-2014; V√°zquez, Clara Lebrato/AAE-7134-2019","Molina, Alberto/0000-0002-2256-0127; Merino-Monge, Manuel/0000-0003-0204-4544; Castro-Garc√≠a, Juan Antonio/0000-0003-1128-6879;",,,,,98,10,12,0,5,IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC,PISCATAWAY,"445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA",2169-3536,,,IEEE ACCESS,IEEE Access,,2019,7,,,,,,70770,70798,,10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2919324,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2919324,,,29,"Computer Science, Information Systems; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Telecommunications",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Computer Science; Engineering; Telecommunications,ID9WE,,gold,,,8/15/24,WOS:000472037100001,,0,356,,,

The robot is programmed to visually track the droplet and either inject more chemical fuel to sustain a motile state or introduce a new chemical component that results in a state change (e.g., division).

The platform is modular, affordable, easy to build and open source. Additional modules presented here include cameras for monitoring eye movements, visual virtual reality, and a micro-manipulator for positioning various probes for recording or optical interference. We demonstrate the utility of the platform by recording eye movements and showing the robust activation of head-direction cells.

Electroencephalographic (EEG) brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) offer a potential communication method for these people without invasive surgery or physical device controls.MethodsAlthough virtual keyboard protocols are well documented in EEG BCI paradigms, these implementations are visually taxing and fatiguing. All English words combine 44 unique phonemes, each corresponding to a unique EEG pattern. In this study, a complete phoneme-based imagined speech EEG BCI was developed and tested on 16 subjects.ResultsUsing open-source hardware and software, machine learning models, such as k-nearest neighbor (KNN), reliably achieved a mean accuracy of 97 +/- 0.001%, a mean F1 of 0.55 +/- 0.01, and a mean AUC-ROC of 0.68 +/- 0.002 in a modified one-versus-rest configuration, resulting in an information transfer rate of 304.15 bits per minute. In line with prior literature, the distinguishing feature between phonemes was the gamma power on channels F3 and F7.DiscussionHowever, adjustments to feature selection, trial window length, and classifier algorithms may improve performance. In summary, these are iterative changes to a viable method directly deployable in current, commercially available systems and software. The development of an intuitive phoneme-based EEG BCI with open-source hardware and software demonstrates the potential ease with which the technology could be deployed in real-world applications.","[Larocco, John] Ohio State Univ, Wexner Med Ctr, Columbus, OH 43210 USA; [Tahmina, Qudsia; Lecian, Sam; Moore, Jason; Helbig, Cole; Gupta, Surya] Ohio State Univ, Dept Elect Engn, Columbus, OH USA",University System of Ohio; Ohio State University; University System of Ohio; Ohio State University,"Larocco, J (corresponding author), Ohio State Univ, Wexner Med Ctr, Columbus, OH 43210 USA.",john.larocco@osumc.edu,,"Larocco, John/0000-0003-2116-5720",IRB [2023H0194],IRB,"The author(s) declare financial support was received for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.

The robot is upgraded by providing it an artificial vision that allows obtaining the position and shape of objects collected by it. A low-cost and open-source hardware solution is also proposed to achieve motion control of the robot through a decentralized control scheme. The robot joints are actuated through five direct current motors coupled to optical encoders. Each encoder signal is fed to a proportional integral derivative controller with anti-windup that employs the motor velocity provided by a state observer. The motion controller works with only two open-architecture Arduino Mega boards, which carry out data acquisition of the optical encoder signals. MATLAB-Simulink is used to implement the controller as well as a friendly graphical interface, which allows the user to interact with the manipulator. The communication between the Arduino boards and MATLAB-Simulink is performed in real-time utilizing the Arduino IO Toolbox. Through the proposed controller, the robot follows a trajectory to collect a desired object, avoiding its collision with other objects.

It also enables rapid prototyping of advanced or novel microscope systems. For long-term time-lapse image data acquisition, slide-scanning or high content analysis, we have developed a novel optical autofocus incorporating orthogonal cylindrical optics to provide robust single-shot closed-loop focus lock, which we have demonstrated to accommodate defocus up to +/- 37 mu mwith <200 nm accuracy, and a two-step autofocus mode which we have shown can operate with defocus up to +/- 68 mu m. We have used this to implement automated single molecule localisation microscopy (SMLM) in a relatively low-cost openFrame-based instrument using multimode diode lasers for excitation and cooled CMOS cameras.","[Lightley, J.; Kumar, S.; Lim, M.

This paper introduces RAVA, a true random number generator based on avalanche noise. RAVA is an open-source device designed to offer a transparent and customizable platform, making auditable and high-quality entropy accessible to a wider audience. The device employs a differential design, which involves comparing two similar noise sources to mitigate the impact of environmental factors. Furthermore, RAVA incorporates a dual entropy core architecture featuring two independent entropy channels that generate random bytes simultaneously. A stochastic model is theoretically derived and empirically confirmed, offering valuable insights into the entropy extraction mechanism and allowing the estimation of the minimum bias attainable. An implementation is presented as a discrete circuit with an ATmega32U4 microcontroller including a USB interface, achieving an unbiased throughput of 136.0 Kbit/s without the necessity of post-processing algorithms. The generated random bytes are evaluated for bias and serial correlation, their entropy is assessed using NIST SP 800-90B estimators, and the randomness quality is verified using the NIST 800-22R1a test suit. For comparison, the same tests are applied to a commercial device based on quantum optical phenomena, revealing similar distributions for both devices across the studied metrics.","[Guerrer, Gabriel] Dor Inst Res & Educ IDOR, IDOR Pioneer Sci Fellow, BR-22281100 Rio de Janeiro, Brazil; [Guerrer, Gabriel] Paradox Sci Inst, Palo Alto, CA 94306 USA",IDOR - Instituto D'Or de Ensino e Pesquisa,"Guerrer, G (corresponding author), Dor Inst Res & Educ IDOR, IDOR Pioneer Sci Fellow, BR-22281100 Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.; Guerrer, G (corresponding author), Paradox Sci Inst, Palo Alto, CA 94306 USA.",gabriel.guerrer@idor.org,,,D'Or Institute for Research and Education (IDOR),D'Or Institute for Research and Education (IDOR),This work was supported by the D'Or Institute for Research and Education (IDOR).,,24,1,1,0,0,IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC,PISCATAWAY,"445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA",2169-3536,,,IEEE ACCESS,IEEE Access,,2023,11,,,,,,119568,119583,,10.1109/ACCESS.2023.3327325,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2023.3327325,,,16,"Computer Science, Information Systems; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Telecommunications",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Computer Science; Engineering; Telecommunications,X8KG2,,gold,,,8/15/24,WOS:001100865400001,,0,365,,,

Typically, their far-field characteristics are validated in expensive, dedicated facilities such as open range sites, or anechoic chambers. Despite being necessary for obtaining high-precision data (e.g., for device qualification), the use of costly infrastructure might not be fully justified when the main goal of measurements includes demonstration of the methodology behind determination of the performance figures of interest (e.g., for the purpose of teaching), or rough validation of the EM simulation model correctness. From this perspective, systems for far-field measurements in non-anechoic environments represent an interesting alternative to the utilization of the state-of-the-art equipment and facilities. Despite their proven usefulness, the mentioned systems are normally constructed around the expensive, laboratory-grade equipment, which contradicts the whole concept of low-cost measurements. This paper discusses a cost-efficient, mobile system for experimental validation of antennas. Its main components include the in-house developed rotary heads, an open-hardware-based vector network analyzer, and the measurements post-processing software. The cost of the system amounts to only around 3630 USD. The capabilities of the device have been demonstrated through measurements of two antenna structures. The considered performance figures include radiation pattern and single-direction gain vs. frequency. Comparisons against the measurements performed in benchmark conditions (anechoic chamber), as well as using professional network analyzer have also been provided. Furthermore, the documentation that facilitates the construction of the system components is shared in an online repository.","[Olencki, Jan; Waladi, Vorya; Bekasiewicz, Adrian] Gdansk Univ Technol, Fac Elect Telecommun & Informat, Gdansk, Poland; [Leifsson, Leifur] Purdue Univ, Sch Aeronaut & Astronaut, W Lafayette, IN USA",Fahrenheit Universities; Gdansk University of Technology; Purdue University System; Purdue University,"Bekasiewicz, A (corresponding author), Gdansk Univ Technol, Fac Elect Telecommun & Informat, Gdansk, Poland.",bekasiewicz@ru.is,"Waladi, Vorya/HTS-5244-2023","Waladi, Vorya/0000-0001-9321-4427; Olencki, Jan/0009-0000-2821-4308",,,,,38,2,2,1,1,IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC,PISCATAWAY,"445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA",2169-3536,,,IEEE ACCESS,IEEE Access,,2023,11,,,,,,39165,39175,,10.1109/ACCESS.2023.3268116,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2023.3268116,,,11,"Computer Science, Information Systems; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Telecommunications",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Computer Science; Engineering; Telecommunications,F0JM4,,gold,,,8/15/24,WOS:000979296000001,,0,366,,,

The DPHP probe showed an accuracy comparable to TDR in estimating water content, with DPHP showing lower values of error index in 3 samples out of 4.

An affinity-based process using Watson-Crick interactions was developed that enables purification of DNA-tagged compounds from complex reaction mixtures. The purification relies on a single-stranded DNA-oligonucleotide, called capture strand, which was covalently coupled to an agarose matrix and to which a DNA-compound conjugate from a DNA-encoded library (DEL) reaction can be reversibly annealed to. The thus-formed DNA duplex tolerated surprisingly stringent washing conditions with multiple solvents to remove excess reactants and reagents. The tolerated solvents included aqueous buffers, aqueous EDTA solutions to remove metal ions, aqueous mixtures of organic solvents, and even pure organic solvents. The purified DNA-conjugate was eluted with aqueous ammonia and could be used for reaction analysis or for instance in DNA -encoded library synthesis.

Those parameters are assessed objectively with commercial instrumentation such as computer-assisted sperm analysis systems (CASA) and hemocytometer. In CASA systems, sperm motility is assessed in the horizontal plane imposed by the stage of the microscope. Thus, there is lack of measurement of the vertical velocity of sperm. The female reproductive tract is a tridimensional space which the sperm traverse to reach the ovum, and there is a need for instruments measuring parameters more relevant to this real-world situation. In this report we describe the design, construction and use of an open-source hardware (OSH) device for evaluation of the vertical velocity of sperm, called UPSPERM. This device was also used to measure sperm concentration, and agreement with hemocytometer was evaluated. Bland-Altman analysis shows good agreement between these two methods of sperm counting. As a first application of UPSPERM, we evaluated the changes in boar sperm motility at distinct pH values between 7.0 and 8.0. The UPSPERM results showed that the vertical velocity of sperm was highest at pH 7.6 and 7.8. We propose that our UPSPERM offers a reliable and affordable option for obtaining measurements of vertical velocity and sperm concentration.","[Rivas Arzaluz, Cindy; Aragon Martinez, Andres] UNAM, Fac Estudios Super Iztacala, Lab Gametos & Desarrollo Tecnol, Paseo Barrios 1, Tlalnepantla, Estado De Mexic, Mexico; [Rivas Arzaluz, Cindy] Unidad Posgrad, Posgrad Ciencias Biol, Edificio A,1er Piso,Ciudad Univ, Mexico City, DF, Mexico; [Ayala, Maria E.] Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Fac Estudios Super Zaragoza, Lab Pubertad, Unidad Invest Biol Reprod, Mexico City, DF, Mexico",Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico; Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico; Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico,"Mart√≠nez, AA (corresponding author), Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Fac Estudios Super Iztacala, Ave Barrios 1, Tlalnepantla 54090, Estado De Mexic, Mexico.",armandres@gmail.com,"Arag√≥n, Andr√©s/AAH-6750-2020; Rivas, Cindy/AEK-8990-2022","Arag√≥n, Andr√©s/0000-0003-2352-2197;",PAPPIT [IN221018],PAPPIT,"PAPPIT, Grant/Award Number: IN221018",,39,3,3,1,3,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1552-4922,1552-4930,,CYTOM PART A,Cytom.

First, a com-pact, mobile system was built using an infrared gas analyzer combined with open-source hardware to control, georeference, and log measurements of CO2 mixing ratios on ve-hicles (car, bicycles). Second, two measurement campaigns, one in summer and one in winter (heating season) were carried out. Five mobile sensors were deployed within a 1x12.7 km transect across the city of Vancouver, BC, Canada. The sensors were operated for 3.5 h on pre-defined routes to map CO2 mixing ratios at street level, which were then averaged to 100 x 100m grid cells. The averaged CO2 mixing ratios of all grids in the study area were 417.9 ppm in summer and 442.5 ppm in winter. In both campaigns, mixing ratios were highest in the grid cells of the downtown core and along arterial roads and lowest in parks and well vegetated residential areas. Third, an aerodynamic resistance approach to calculating emissions was used to derive CO2 emissions from the gridded CO2 mixing ratio mea-surements in conjunction with mixing ratios and fluxes collected from a 28 m tall eddycovariance tower located within the study area. These measured emissions showed a range of 12 to 226CO(2) ha 1 h 1 in summer and of -14 to 163 kgCO(2) ha 1 h 1 in winter, with an average of 35.1 kgCO(2) ha (-1) h (-1) (summer) and 25.9 kgCO(2) ha 1 h 1 (winter). Fourth, an independent emissions inventory was developed for the study area using buildings energy simulations from a previous study and routinely available traffic counts. The emissions inventory for the same area averaged to 22.06 kgCO(2) ha (-1) h (-1) (summer) and 28.76 kgCO(2) ha (-1) h (-1) (winter) and was used to compare against the measured emissions from the mobile sensor network. The comparison on a grid-by-grid basis showed linearity between CO2 mixing ratios and the emissions inventory (R (2) =53 in summer and R (2) = 47 in winter). Also, 87% (summer) and 94% (winter) of measured grid cells show a difference within +/- 1 order of magnitude, and 49% (summer) and 69% (winter) show an error of less than a factor 2. Although associated with considerable errors at the individual grid cell level, the study demonstrates a promising method of using a network of mobile sensors and an aerody-namic resistance approach to rapidly map greenhouse gases at high spatial resolution across cities. The method could be improved by longer measurements and a refined calculation of the aerodynamic resistance.","[Lee, Joseph K.; Christen, Andreas; Ketler, Rick; Nesic, Zoran] Univ British Columbia, Dept Geog, Atmospher Sci Program, Vancouver, BC, Canada; [Nesic, Zoran] Univ British Columbia, Fac Land & Food Syst, Biometeorol Grp, Vancouver, BC, Canada",University of British Columbia; University of British Columbia,"Christen, A (corresponding author), Univ British Columbia, Dept Geog, Atmospher Sci Program, Vancouver, BC, Canada.",andreas.christen@ubc.ca,"Nesic, Zoran/C-9655-2015; Christen, Andreas/I-6037-2012","Nesic, Zoran/0000-0001-5728-513X; Christen, Andreas/0000-0003-3864-1703; Lee, Joseph/0000-0002-2344-8954","NSERC Discovery Grant (""Direct measurement of greenhouse gas exchange in urban ecosystems""); Canada Foundation for Innovation [17141, 33600]; NSERC CREATE; Mozilla Science Lab; ""moovel lab"", Stuttgart, Germany","NSERC Discovery Grant (""Direct measurement of greenhouse gas exchange in urban ecosystems"")(Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)); Canada Foundation for Innovation(Canada Foundation for InnovationCGIARSpanish Government); NSERC CREATE(Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)); Mozilla Science Lab; ""moovel lab"", Stuttgart, Germany","This paper was supported through an NSERC Discovery Grant (""Direct measurement of greenhouse gas exchange in urban ecosystems"", A.

Acquiring such a policy on a real robot is a tedious and time-consuming task. This is more challenging in a multi-agent system where individual data may be required from each agent. While training in simulations is the common approach due to efficiency and low-cost, they rarely describe the real world. Consequently, policies trained in simulations and transferred to the real robot usually perform poorly. In this paper, we present a novel real-to-sim-to-real framework to bridge the reality gap for an agent in collective motion of a homogeneous multi-agent system. First, we propose a novel deep neural-network architecture termed Convolutional-Recurrent Network (CR-Net) to capture the complex state transition of an agent and simulate its motion. Once trained with data from one agent, we show that the CR-Net can accurately predict motion of all agents in the group. Second, we propose to invest a limited amount of real data from the agent in a generative model. Then, training the CR-Net with synthetic data sampled from the generative model is shown to be at least equivalent to real data. Hence, the proposed approach provides a sufficiently accurate model with significantly less real data. The generative model can also be disseminated along with open-source hardware for easier usage. We show experiments on ground and underwater vehicles in which multi-agent RL policies are trained in the simulation for collective motion and successfully transferred to the real-world.","[Gurevich, Anton; Bamani, Eran; Sintov, Avishai] Tel Aviv Univ, Sch Mech Engn, Haim Levanon, IL-6997801 Tel Aviv, Israel",Tel Aviv University,"Sintov, A (corresponding author), Tel Aviv Univ, Sch Mech Engn, Haim Levanon, IL-6997801 Tel Aviv, Israel.",antong@mail.tau.ac.il; eranbamani@mail.tau.ac.il; sintov1@tauex.tau.ac.il,"Sintov, Avishai/JAD-0128-2023","Bamani, Eran/0000-0001-5007-3134",,,,,60,0,0,1,9,SPRINGER LONDON LTD,LONDON,"236 GRAYS INN RD, 6TH FLOOR, LONDON WC1X 8HL, ENGLAND",0941-0643,1433-3058,,NEURAL COMPUT APPL,Neural Comput.

This system decides whether the current block belongs to the object region or not. In this article, a scheme using background modeling based on runtime-weighted features for robustly adaptive moving object segmentation in infrared (IR) image sequence is proposed. Proposed background modeling for an open hardware (H/W) architecture design decreases the size of the search area to construct a sparse block template of search area in infrared images. The authors also compensate for motion compensation when the image moves in previous and current frames of IR imaging system. The method of separation of background and objects applies to adaptive values through time analysis of pixel intensity The proposed method uses more feature information such as intensity, deviation, block matching error, and velocity. The weighting values give a higher weight to feature information which has a large difference between the object and the background region. Based on experimental results, the proposed method showed real-time moving object segmentation through background modeling in the proposed embedded system.

Current is injected using a Keithley 6221 current source, and voltages are recordedwith a 24-bit EEGsystemwithminimumbandwidth of 3.2 kHz. Custom PCBs interface with a PC to control the measurement process, electrode addressing and triggering of external stimuli. The performance of the system was characterised using resistor phantoms to represent human scalp recordings, with an SNR of 77.5 dB, stable across a four hour recording and 20 Hz to 20 kHz. In studies of both haeomorrhage using scalp electrodes, and evoked activity using epicortical electrode mats in rats, it was possible to reconstruct images matching established literature at known areas of onset. Data collected using scalp electrode in humans matched known tissue impedance spectra and was stable over frequency. The experimental procedure is software controlled and is readily adaptable to new paradigms. Where possible, commercial or open-source components were used, to minimise the complexity in reproduction. The hardware designs and software for the system have been released under an open source licence, encouraging contributions and allowing for rapid replication.","[Avery, James; Dowrick, Thomas; Faulkner, Mayo; Goren, Nir; Holder, David] UCL, Dept Med Phys & Biomed Engn, London WC1E 6BT, England",University of London; University College London,"Avery, J (corresponding author), UCL, Dept Med Phys & Biomed Engn, London WC1E 6BT, England.",j.avery@ucl.ac.uk; t.dowrick@ucl.ac.uk; mayo.faulkner@ucl.ac.uk; n.goren@ucl.ac.uk; d.holder@ucl.ac.uk,"Avery, James/C-8526-2018","Avery, James/0000-0002-4015-1802; holder, david/0000-0003-2755-6124",EPSRC [EP/M506448/1]; MRC [MR/K00767X/1]; MRC [MR/K00767X/1] Funding Source: UKRI,EPSRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)); MRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Medical Research Council UK (MRC)); MRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Medical Research Council UK (MRC)),This work was supported by EPSRC grant EP/M506448/1 and MRC grant MR/K00767X/1.,,51,75,76,2,31,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,1424-8220,,SENSORS-BASEL,Sensors,FEB,2017,17,2,,,,,,,280,10.3390/s17020280,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/s17020280,,,20,"Chemistry, Analytical; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Instruments & Instrumentation",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Chemistry; Engineering; Instruments & Instrumentation,EM7HS,28146122,"Green Published, Green Submitted, gold",,,8/15/24,WOS:000395482700064,,0,373,,,

Here, we present three contributions towards making the field of acoustic holography more widespread. Firstly, we introduce an iterative algorithm that accurately calculates the amplitudes and phases of an array of ultrasound emitters in order to create a target amplitude field in mid-air. Secondly, we use the algorithm to analyse the impact of spatial, amplitude and phase emission resolution on the resulting acoustic field, thus providing engineering insights towards array design. For example, we show an onset of diminishing returns for smaller than a quarter-wavelength sized emitters and a phase and amplitude resolution of eight and four divisions per period, respectively. Lastly, we present a hardware platform for the generation of acoustic holograms. The array is integrated in a single board composed of 256 emitters operating at 40 kHz.

The instrument agitates and illuminates microalgae suspensions grown inside flasks. It was optimized for low production cost, simplicity, low power consumption, design flexibility, consistent, and controllable growth light intensity. The illuminated orbital shaker is especially well suited for low-resource research laboratories and education. It is an alternative to commercial instruments for microalgae cultivation. It improves on typical do-it-yourself microalgae growth systems by offering consistent and well characterized illumination light intensity. The illuminated growth area is 20 cm x 15 cm, which is suitable for three T75 tissue culture flasks or six 100 ml Erlenmeyer flasks. The photosynthetic photon flux density, is variable in eight steps (26 - 800 mu mol.m(-2).s(-1)) and programmable in a 24-h light/dark cycle. The agitation speed is variable (0 - 210 RPM). The overall material cost is around 300 pound, including an entry-level orbital shaker. The build takes two days, requiring electronics and mechanical assembly capabilities. The instrument build is documented in a set of open-source protocols, design files, and source code. The design can be readily modified, scaled, and adapted for other orbital shakers and specific experimental requirements. The instrument function was validated by growing fresh-water microalgae Desmodesmus quadricauda and Chlorella vulgaris.

One popular approach is to measure the movements of restrained animals while presenting controlled sensory stimulation. This approach is especially powerful when applied to genetic model organisms, such as Drosophila melanogaster, where modern genetic tools enable unprecedented access to the nervous system for activity monitoring or targeted manipulation. While there is a long history of measuring the behavior of body- and head-fixed insects walking on an air-supported ball, the methods typically require complex setups with many custom components. Here we present a compact, simplified setup for these experiments that achieves high-performance at low cost. The simplified setup integrates existing hardware and software solutions with new component designs. We replaced expensive optomechanical and custom machined components with off-the-shelf and 3D-printed parts, and built the system around a low-cost camera that achieves 180 Hz imaging and an inexpensive tablet computer to present view-angle-corrected stimuli updated through a local network. We quantify the performance of the integrated system and characterize the visually guided behavior of flies in response to a range of visual stimuli. In this paper, we thoroughly document the improved system; the accompanying repository incorporates CAD files, parts lists, source code, and detailed instructions. We detail a complete ~$300 system, including a cold-anesthesia tethering stage, that is ideal for hands-on teaching laboratories. This represents a nearly 50-fold cost reduction as compared to a typical system used in research laboratories, yet is fully featured and yields excellent performance. We report the current state of this system, which started with a 1-day teaching lab for which we built seven parallel setups and continues toward a setup in our lab for larger-scale analysis of visual-motor behavior in flies. Because of the simplicity, compactness, and low cost of this system, we believe that high-performance measurements of tethered insect behavior should now be widely accessible and suitable for integration into many systems. This access enables broad opportunities for comparative work across labs, species, and behavioral paradigms.","[Loesche, Frank; Reiser, Michael B.] Howard Hughes Med Inst, Janelia Res Campus, Ashburn, VA 20147 USA",Howard Hughes Medical Institute,"Reiser, MB (corresponding author), Howard Hughes Med Inst, Janelia Res Campus, Ashburn, VA 20147 USA.",reiserm@janelia.hhmi.org,,"Loesche, Frank/0000-0002-7780-6438",HHMI,HHMI(Howard Hughes Medical Institute),This project was supported by HHMI.,,35,4,4,0,7,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,LAUSANNE,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",1662-5153,,,FRONT BEHAV NEUROSCI,Front.

We choose a Stewart platform with rotary actuators to manipulate the plate. We explain the construction method of the platform in detail. We use a touch panel as a sensor to obtain the positional data at a high sample rate and to make the system compact. As a main control unit, we use a Nucleo-32 board, which is a small and powerful open source hardware with a built-in floating point unit. For controller synthesis, we show a mathematical model of the ball and plate system and explain the kinematics analysis of the Stewart platform. We design a sliding mode controller that includes error integration, which makes the system robust against external disturbances. We describe the results of the simulations and the experiments and then illustrate the advantage of the applied sliding mode control compared to LQ control. The proposed system is cost-effective, can be easily built, has good control performance, and occupies a small space. For these reasons, we expect that the system can be efficiently used as an educational tool.","[Bang, Heeseung; Lee, Young Sam] Inha Univ, Dept Elect Engn, Incheon 22212, South Korea",Inha University,"Lee, YS (corresponding author), Inha Univ, Dept Elect Engn, Incheon 22212, South Korea.",lys@inha.ac.kr,"Bang, Heeseung/GWN-2329-2022","Bang, Heeseung/0000-0003-4331-1952",Inha University,Inha University,This work was supported by the Inha University Research Grant.,,17,27,30,3,11,IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC,PISCATAWAY,"445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA",2169-3536,,,IEEE ACCESS,IEEE Access,,2018,6,,,,,,32401,32408,,10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2838544,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2838544,,,8,"Computer Science, Information Systems; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Telecommunications",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Computer Science; Engineering; Telecommunications,GM1NW,,gold,,,8/15/24,WOS:000437836800001,,0,378,,,

The validation of its operability was performed with two experiments to measure the spatial distribution of the unperturbed field from the generator and the vortex field formed by the spiral phase plate.

One of the most promising solutions that couple the flexibility of a processor with the performance and efficiency of an accelerator is the vector processor architecture. Since RISC-V has only recently frozen its vector ISA extension, no open-source RISC-V-based vector processor has been fabricated and characterized. This brief presents the Yun SoC, featuring the first implementation of an open-source RISC-V-based vector processor in TSMC's 65-nm technology. Our efficient 4-lane design achieves almost peak theoretical performance on large matrix multiplication problems with an FPU utilization of almost 90%. Yun, with a critical path of 30 FO4 inverter delays, achieves a peak performance of 2.83 GFLOPSDP (at 400 MHz and 1.5 V), a leading-edge area efficiency of 3 GFLOPSP/cycle/MGE, and a peak energy efficiency of 10.8 GFLOPSDP (at 100 MHz and 0.85 V).

Rapidly evolving clinical and scientific requirements have created a need for hardware and software that can be customized for specific applications. Hardware may require customization to enable a variety of recording types (e.g., electroencephalogram, local field potentials, or multi-unit activity) while meeting the stringent and costly requirements of MRI safety and compatibility. Real-time signal processing tools are an enabling technology for studies of learning, attention, sleep, epilepsy, neurofeedback, and neuropharmacology, yet real-time signal processing tools are difficult to develop. We describe an open-source system for simultaneous electrophysiology and fMRI featuring low-noise (< 0.6 mu V p-p input noise), electromagnetic compatibility for MRI (tested up to 7T), and user-programmable real-time signal processing. The hardware distribution provides the complete specifications required to build an MRI-compatible electrophysiological data acquisition system, including circuit schematics, print circuit board (PCB) layouts, Gerber files for PCB fabrication and robotic assembly, a bill of materials with part numbers, data sheets, and vendor information, and test procedures. The software facilitates rapid implementation of real-time signal processing algorithms. This system has been used in human EEG/fMRI studies at 3 and 7T examining the auditory system, visual system, sleep physiology, and anesthesia, as well as in intracranial electrophysiological studies of the non-human primate visual system during 3T fMRI, and in human hyperbaric physiology studies at depths of up to 300 feet below sea level.

The DRD-BIBLOX consists of one or more 3D- printed rhizoboxes, which can be filled with soil while still providing root visibility. The rhizoboxes sit in a scaffold of secondhand LEGO((R)) bricks, which allows root development in the dark and non-invasive root tracking with an infrared (IR) camera and an IR light-emitting diode (LED) cluster. Proteomic analyses confirmed significant effects of root illumination on barley root and shoot proteomes. Additionally, we confirmed the significant effect of root illumination on barley root and shoot phenotypes. Our data therefore reinforces the importance of the application of field conditions in the lab and the value of our novel device, the DRD-BIBLOX. We further provide a DRD-BIBLOX application spectrum, spanning from investigating a variety of plant species and soil conditions and simulating different environmental conditions and stresses, to proteomic and phenotypic analyses, including early root tracking in the dark.","[Dermendjiev, Georgi; Schnurer, Madeleine; Thuer, Alexandra; Plott, Stefan; Ibl, Verena] Univ Vienna, Dept Funct & Evolutionary Ecol, Mol Syst Biol MoSys, Vienna, Austria; [Stewart, Ethan; Jez, Jakub] Vienna Bioctr Core Facil VBCF, Plant Sci Facil, Vienna, Austria; [Naegele, Thomas; Marino, Giada; Leister, Dario] Ludwig Maximilians Univ Munchen, Fac Biol, Plant Evolutionary Cell Biol, Planegg Martinsried, Germany",University of Vienna; University of Munich,"Ibl, V (corresponding author), Univ Vienna, Dept Funct & Evolutionary Ecol, Mol Syst Biol MoSys, Vienna, Austria.",verena.ibl@univie.ac.at,"Naegele, Thomas/JAZ-9854-2023; Marino, Giada/D-7527-2017","Naegele, Thomas/0000-0002-5896-238X; Marino, Giada/0000-0002-1525-4244; Plott, Stefan/0000-0002-9135-3519; Jez, Jakub/0000-0002-6481-4383",Austrian Science Fund FWF [33891]; FWF,Austrian Science Fund FWF(Austrian Science Fund (FWF)); FWF(Austrian Science Fund (FWF)),This research was funded by the Austrian Science Fund FWF P 33891 and FWF DOC111.,,61,0,0,3,11,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,LAUSANNE,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",1664-462X,,,FRONT PLANT SCI,Front.

A segmented SAR-ADC uses a coarse SAR-ADC to compute some most significant bits (MSBs). Four methods, namely aligned switching (AS) with bitwise RCRs, AS with a subsample-wise RCR, detect-and-skip aligned switching (DAS-AS) with bitwise RCRs, and DAS-AS with a subsample-wise RCR are introduced for setting fine MSBs. Closed-form analytic expressions of the reference error due to the finite reference capacitance are derived and validated by behavioral modeling and circuit simulation of an 11-bit 50 MS/s segmented SAR ADC in 65-nm CMOS technology. The error expressions can be used to select one of the four methods for setting the fine MSBs and to determine \beta for the required linearity or for implementing digital circuitry for precise error correction.","[Wang, Aili; Shi, C. -J.

As such, distributing these sensors across a robot's body could be beneficial for operation in human environments. We present a stretchable fabric-based skin with force and thermal sensors that is suitable for covering areas of a robot's body, including curved surfaces. It also adds a layer of compliance that conforms to manipulated objects, improving thermal sensing. Our open hardware design addresses thermal sensing challenges, such as the time to heat the sensors, the efficiency of sensing, and the distribution of sensors across the skin. It incorporates small self-heated temperature sensors on the surface of the skin that directly make contact with objects, improving the sensors' response times. Our approach seeks to fully cover the robot's body with large force sensors, but treats temperature sensors as small, point-like sensors sparsely distributed across the skin. We present a mathematical model to help predict how many of these point-like temperature sensors should be used in order to increase the likelihood of them making contact with an object. To evaluate our design, we conducted tests in which a robot arm used a cylindrical end effector covered with skin to slide objects and press on objects made from four different materials. After assessing the safety of our design, we also had the robot make contact with the forearms and clothed shoulders of 10 human participants. With 2.0 s of contact, the actively-heated temperature sensors enabled binary classification accuracy over 90% for the majority of material pairs. The system could more rapidly distinguish between materials with large differences in their thermal effusivities (e.g., 90% accuracy for pine wood vs. aluminum with 0.5 s of contact). For discrimination between humans vs. the four materials, the skin's force and thermal sensing modalities achieved 93% classification accuracy with 0.5 s of contact. Overall, our results suggest that our skin design could enable robots to recognize contact with distinct task-relevant materials and humans while performing manipulation tasks in human environments.

The ARM9 extension board runs in parallel with the dsPIC microprocessor on the e-puck motherboard with communication between the two via an SPI bus. The extension board is designed to handle computationally intensive image processing, wireless communication and high-level intelligent robot control algorithms, while the dsPIC handles low-level sensor interfacing, data processing and motor control. The extension board runs an embedded Linux operating system, along with a Debian-based port of the root file system stored in a Micro SD card.

The same principle can be applied to scanning angle interference microscopy (SAIM), where precision control of the scanned laser beam presents unique technical challenges for the builders of custom azimuthal scanning microscopes. Accurate synchronization between the instrument computer, beam scanning system and excitation source is required to collect high quality data and minimize sample damage in SAIM acquisitions. Drawing inspiration from open-source prototyping systems, like the Arduino microcontroller boards, we developed a new instrument control platform to be affordable, easily programmed, and broadly useful, but with integrated, precision analog circuitry and optimized firmware routines tailored to advanced microscopy. We show how the integration of waveform generation, multiplexed analog outputs, and native hardware triggers into a single central hub provides a versatile platform for performing fast circle-scanning acquisitions, including azimuthal scanning SAIM and multiangle TIRF. We also demonstrate how the low communication latency of our hardware platform can reduce image intensity and reconstruction artifacts arising from synchronization errors produced by software control.

It can offer a reference design for better and further research of CCSs. Then, a cloud-based maglev control system (CMCS) is developed, and a case study on tracking control with disturbance is performed. Furthermore, a dual-structural controller based on equivalent-input-disturbance (EID) and networked predictive control (NPC) approach is devised to enhance the disturbance rejection performance for CCSs with communication constraints. The system is divided into two subsystems, and the separation theorem is applied to simplify the design. A discrete-time EID (DEID) estimator is introduced for one subsystem to compensate for the time delay and the exogenous disturbance. For another subsystem, a time-event-driven strategy-based NPC method is devised to increase the dynamical performance of handling packet loss.

Many industries have shifted to vacuum drying as cost- or time-saving measures. Small-scale vacuum drying, however, has been limited by the high costs of specialty scientific tools. To make vacuum drying more accessible, this study provides design and performance information for a small-scale open source vacuum oven, which can be fabricated from off-the-shelf and 3-D printed components. The oven is tested for drying speed and effectiveness on both waste plastic polyethylene terephthalate (PET) and a consortium of bacteria developed for bioprocessing of terephthalate wastes to assist in distributed recycling of PET for both additive manufacturing as well as potential food. Both materials can be damaged when exposed to high temperatures, making vacuum drying a desirable solution. The results showed that the open source vacuum oven was effective at drying both plastic and biomaterials, drying at a higher rate than a hot-air dryer for small samples or for low volumes of water. The system can be constructed for less than 20% of commercial vacuum dryer costs for several laboratory-scale applications, including dehydration of bio-organisms, drying plastic for distributed recycling and additive manufacturing, and chemical processing.","[Hubbard, Benjamin R.] Michigan Technol Univ, Dept Mech Engn Engn Mech, Houghton, MI 49931 USA; [Putman, Lindsay, I; Techtmann, Stephen] Michigan Technol Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Houghton, MI 49931 USA; [Pearce, Joshua M.] Michigan Technol Univ, Dept Mat Sci & Engn, Houghton, MI 49931 USA; [Pearce, Joshua M.] Michigan Technol Univ, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, Houghton, MI 49931 USA; [Pearce, Joshua M.] Univ Lorraine, Equipe Rech Proc Innovatifs ERPI, F-54010 Nancy, France",Michigan Technological University; Michigan Technological University; Michigan Technological University; Michigan Technological University; Universite de Lorraine,"Pearce, JM (corresponding author), Michigan Technol Univ, Dept Mat Sci & Engn, Houghton, MI 49931 USA.; Pearce, JM (corresponding author), Michigan Technol Univ, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, Houghton, MI 49931 USA.; Pearce, JM (corresponding author), Univ Lorraine, Equipe Rech Proc Innovatifs ERPI, F-54010 Nancy, France.",brhubbar@mtu.edu; liputman@mtu.edu; smtechtm@mtu.edu; pearce@mtu.edu,"; Pearce, Joshua/C-9240-2013","Putman, Lindsay/0000-0001-5175-9373; Hubbard, Benjamin/0000-0002-7614-5332; Pearce, Joshua/0000-0001-9802-3056",Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency ReSource program [HR00112020033]; NSF SBIR Phase II [1746480]; Witte Endowment; Directorate For Engineering [1746480] Funding Source: National Science Foundation; Div Of Industrial Innovation & Partnersh [1746480] Funding Source: National Science Foundation,Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency ReSource program; NSF SBIR Phase II(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Engineering (ENG)); Witte Endowment; Directorate For Engineering(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Engineering (ENG)); Div Of Industrial Innovation & Partnersh(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Engineering (ENG)),"Funding for this work was provided by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency ReSource program cooperative agreement HR00112020033, the NSF SBIR Phase II grant number: 1746480, and theWitte Endowment.

A small-scale autonomous pontoon boat has been built, equipped with the open-hardware flight controller, GPS receiver, Inertial Measurement Units (IMU) and the magnetometer. A 2(3) factorial design based on Design of Experiment (DOE) is carried out to study the influence of three parameters (turn_rate, turn_angle and damping) on the response variable (peak-to-peak deviation from the desired trajectory). Total 24 experiments have been conducted by setting the desired trajectory as a circle with diameter 20 m. The peak-to-peak deviation in each experiment has been observed. The analyses revealed that the damping has low interaction with the turn angle and turn rate while there is a stronger interaction between the turn angle and turn rate. And the peak-to-peak deviation of the trajectory tends to decrease when the parameter damping was set to high value. The regression model has been derived and plotted as a response surface. The optimized parameters were selected from the plot and perform the experiment with three replications. The results confirm that parameters tuning has improved the performance of the boat significantly. With the DOE approach, the impact of two or more parameters on a response, the interaction between parameters can be investigated systematically. This approach is an effective way to tuning the parameters and can be applied to various kinds of the autonomous vehicle.","[Thianwiboon, Mongkol] Mahidol Univ, Fac Engn, Dept Ind Engn, Nakhon Pathom 73170, Thailand",Mahidol University,"Thianwiboon, M (corresponding author), Mahidol Univ, Fac Engn, Dept Ind Engn, Nakhon Pathom 73170, Thailand.",mongkol.thi@mahidol.ac.th,,,,,,,34,2,2,0,0,"CHULALONGKORN UNIV, FAC ENGINEERING",BANGKOK,"254 PHAYATHAI RD, PATHUMWAN, BANGKOK, 10330, THAILAND",0125-8281,,,ENG J-THAIL,Eng.

Generic components are used to allow the repurposing of parts for other uses. The computer-controlled high-voltage power supply box associated with the project can be used for other common high-voltage applications in Aerosol Science and Technology, such as data acquisition and control systems for scanning mobility particle sizers. Computational fluid dynamics simulations are used to quantify the 3D flow field. The transfer function associated with the partial transmission is characterized through modeling and experiments. The observed transfer function is unique but deviates from the ideal transfer function due to the distortion of the flow near the inlet and the outlet of the device. Singly charged particles up to 624 nm and 253 nm can be completely removed for 0.5 L min(-1) and 1 L min(-1), respectively.

Considering the efficiency and precision, we present a novel oriented-object detection method called Rotation-SqueezeDet. This method can run on embedded-platforms in near real-time. Besides, this method can give the oriented bounding box of an object in images to enable a rotation-aware grasping. Based on this method, a UAM platform was designed and built. We have given the formulation, positioning, control, and planning of the whole UAM system. All the mechanical designs are fully provided as open-source hardware for reuse by the community.

Here, we present the development of several microcontroller devices that provide temporal and intensity control of light emitting diodes (LEDs) for computer controlled microscopy illumination. We interfaced one microcontroller with mu Manager for rapid and dynamic overlay of transmitted and fluorescent images. Moreover, on the basis of this illumination system we implemented an electronic circuit to combine two pulsed LED light sources for fast (up to 1 kHz) ratiometric calcium (Ca2+) imaging. This microcontroller enabled the calibration of intracellular Ca2+ concentration and furthermore the combination of Ca2+ imaging with optogenetic activation. The devices are based on affordable components and open-source hardware and software. Integration into existing bright-field microscope systems will take similar to 1 day. The microcontroller based LED imaging substantially advances conventional illumination methods by limiting light exposure and adding versatility and speed.","[Battefeld, Arne; Popovic, Marko A.; Kole, Maarten H.

Indirect low frequency ultrasonic energy (US), using baths, has been recently proposed as an effective alternative for crude oil demulsification. However, the reactor position during sonication and its influence on the demulsification efficiency for crude oil has not been evaluated. In this sense, the aim of this study was to develop an automated system based on an open source hardware for mapping the acoustic field distribution in an US bath operating at 35 kHz using a hydrophone. Data acquired with this system provided information to evaluate the demulsification efficiency in the different positions of the US bath and correlate it with the acoustic intensity distribution. The automated 3D-mapping system revealed a higher acoustic intensity in the regions immediately above the transducers (ca. 0.6 W cm(-2)), while the other regions presented a relatively lower intensity (ca. 0.1 W cm(-2)). Experimental data demonstrated that reactors positioned in the most intense acoustic regions provided a much higher efficiency of demulsificadon in comparison with the ones positioned in the less intense acoustic field regions. Demulsification efficiency up to 93% was obtained with 15 min of sonication (100% amplitude) using few amount of chemical demulsifier. Hence, this work demonstrated that the information acquired with the developed mapping system could be used for inducing a higher efficiency of demulsification only by finding the more suitable position of reactor in the US bath, which certainly will help development of appropriate reactors design when looking for such approach.","[Pedrotti, Matheus F.] Univ Fed Santa Maria, Dept Engn Quim, BR-97105900 Santa Maria, RS, Brazil; [Enders, Michele S.

These protocols are complex and need to be implemented correctly for correct operation of the system-on-chip. Therefore, protocol verification has received significant attention. However, this verification is often limited to checking high-level properties on a protocol specification or an implementation. Verifying these properties directly on an implementation faces scalability challenges due to its size and design complexity. Further, even after some high-level properties are verified, there is no guarantee that an implementation fully complies with a given specification, even if the same properties have also been checked on the specification. We address these challenges and gaps by adding a layer of component specifications, one for each component in the protocol implementation, and specifying and verifying the interactions at the interfaces between each pair of communicating components. We use the recently proposed formal model termed Instruction-Level Abstraction (ILA) as a component specification, which includes an interface specification for the interactions in composing different components. The use of ILA models as component specifications allows us to decompose the complete verification task into two sub-tasks: checking that the composition of ILAs is sequentially equivalent to a verified formal protocol specification, and checking that the protocol implementation is a refinement of the ILA composition. This check requires that each component implementation is a refinement of its ILA specification and includes interface checks guaranteeing that components interact with each other as specified. We have applied the proposed ILA-based methodology for protocol verification to several third-party design case studies. These include an AXI on-chip communication protocol, an off-chip communication protocol, and a cache coherence protocol. For each system, we successfully detected bugs in the implementation, and show that the full formal verification can be completed in reasonable time and effort.","[Lu, Huaixi; Xing, Yue; Gupta, Aarti; Malik, Sharad] Princeton Univ, 1 Nassau Hall, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA",Princeton University,"Lu, HX (corresponding author), Princeton Univ, 1 Nassau Hall, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA.",huaixil@princeton.edu; yuex@princeton.edu; aarti@cs.princeton.edu; sharad@princeton.edu,,"Malik, Sharad/0000-0002-0837-5443; Gupta, Aarti/0000-0001-6676-9400; Lu, Huaixi/0000-0002-3875-1761","Applications Driving Architectures (ADA) Research Center, a JUMP Center - SRC; DARPA; NSF [1628926]; DARPA POSH Program Project: Upscale: Scaling up formal tools for POSH Open Source Hardware","Applications Driving Architectures (ADA) Research Center, a JUMP Center - SRC; DARPA(United States Department of DefenseDefense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA)); NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)); DARPA POSH Program Project: Upscale: Scaling up formal tools for POSH Open Source Hardware(United States Department of Defense)","This work was supported by the Applications Driving Architectures (ADA) Research Center, a JUMP Center co-sponsored by SRC and DARPA.

An effective, reusable, locally-manufactured respirator can mitigate this problem. We describe the development, manufacture, and preliminary testing of an open-hardware-licensed device, the ""simple silicone mask"" (SSM). Methods A multidisciplinary team developed a reusable silicone half facepiece respirator over 9 prototype iterations. The manufacturing process consisted of 3D printing and silicone casting. Prototypes were assessed for comfort and breathability. Filtration was assessed by user seal checks and quantitative fit-testing according to CSA Z94.4-18. Results The respirator originally included a cartridge for holding filter material; this was modified to connect to standard heat-moisture exchange (HME) filters (N95 or greater) after the cartridge showed poor filtration performance due to flow acceleration around the filter edges, which was exacerbated by high filter resistance. All 8 HME-based iterations provided an adequate seal by user seal checks and achieved a pass rate of 87.5% (N = 8) on quantitative testing, with all failures occurring in the first iteration. The overall median fit-factor was 1662 (100 = pass). Estimated unit cost for a production run of 1000 using distributed manufacturing techniques is CAD $15 in materials and 20 minutes of labor. Conclusion Small-scale manufacturing of an effective, reusable N95 respirator during a pandemic is feasible and cost-effective. Required quantities of reusables are more predictable and less vulnerable to supply chain disruption than disposables. With further evaluation, such devices may be an alternative to disposable respirators during public health emergencies. The respirator described above is an investigational device and requires further evaluation and regulatory requirements before clinical deployment. The authors and affiliates do not endorse the use of this device at present.","[Anwari, Vahid] Univ Hlth Network, Toronto Gen Hosp, Joint Dept Med Imaging, Toronto, ON, Canada; [Anwari, Vahid; Kazlovich, Kate; Hiansen, Joshua; Mashari, Azad] Univ Hlth Network, Toronto Gen Hosp, Dept Anesthesiol & Pain Management, Lynn & Arnold Irwin Adv Perioperat Imaging Lab, Toronto, ON, Canada; [Ng, William C.

The superior-inferior movement required to simulate tumour motion during a normal breathing cycle was achieved via the novel use of an Arduino Uno (TM), a low-cost open-source microcontroller board connected to a high torque servo motor. Slow CT imaging was used to acquire the image set and a 4D cone beam CT (4D-CBCT) verified the efficacy of contoured margins before treatment on the moving phantom. Treatment fields were delivered to a section of a CIRS (TM) anthropomorphic phantom. Dose verification to the dynamic phantom with Gafchromic EBT3 film using 3 %-1 mm gamma analysis acceptance criteria registered an absolute dose pass rate for IMRT and VMAT of 98 and 96.6 %, respectively. It was verified that 100 % of the PTV received the prescribed dose of 12 Gy per fraction using the dynamic phantom, and no major discrepancy between planned and measured results due to interplay between multileaf collimator sequences and target motion was observed. This study confirmed that the use of an in-house solution using open source hardware and software with existing quality assurance equipment was appropriate in validating a new treatment technique.","[Munoz, Luis; Ziebell, Amy; Morton, Jason; Bhat, Madhava] Adelaide Radiotherapy Ctr, Genesis Canc Care, 352 South Terrace, Adelaide, SA 5000, Australia",,"Munoz, L (corresponding author), Adelaide Radiotherapy Ctr, Genesis Canc Care, 352 South Terrace, Adelaide, SA 5000, Australia.",luis.munoz@adradcentre.com.au,,,Genesiscare,Genesiscare,"I would like to acknowledge Genesiscare for their funding support, and thank Thulani Nyathi, Christopher Colyer and David Willis for help revising the manuscript.",,33,3,3,0,5,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0158-9938,1879-5447,,AUSTRALAS PHYS ENG S,Australas.

In order to monitor soil salinization in plant physiological experiments, a salinity monitoring system - SProb - was produced to improve our understanding of plant responses to salinity, using open hardware Arduino platform. An experiment was performed and designed to calibrate and check the viability and accuracy of SProb to be used in scientific researches. Salt concentrations were manipulated to identify sensor ability in determining salt accumulation or leaching in soils. Also, two mangrove plant species were grown to identify if root presence would affect soil salt measurements. The soil osmotic potential (psi(s)) was estimated from SProb results and correlated with predawn and midday leaf water potential (psi(l)) of the mangrove plants, to identify if psi(s) would affect plants water regulations. It was also shown that SProb described well the soil salt accumulation or leaching along the time, and the measurements were not affected by the presence of roots. The ranges of psi(s) matched with the range of mangrove psi(l), and the psi(l) decreased with the decrease in psi(s) (increase in salinity). It was confirmed that the SProb sensor is efficient, cheap and has enough accuracy to monitor soil salt concentration. Thus, SProb can be used in plant physiological experiments increasing our ability to make accurate science when such technology is not available in research centers.","[Negrao-Rodrigues, Vanessa] Museu Paraense Emilio Goeldi, Programa Posgrad Bot Trop, Belem, Para, Brazil; [Negrao-Rodrigues, Vanessa] Univ Fed Rural Amazonia, Belem, Para, Brazil; [Teodoro, Grazielle Sales] Univ Fed Para, Inst Ciencias Biol, Dept Biol, Belem, Para, Brazil; [Marques-Azevedo, Mario J.] Plantem Plant Technol & Environm Monitoring Ltd, Dept P&D, Sao Jose Dos Campos, Brazil; [Brum, Mauro] Univ Arizona, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Tucson, AZ USA",Museu Paraense Emilio Goeldi; Universidade Federal Rural da Amazonia (UFRA); Universidade Federal do Para; University of Arizona,"Negrao-Rodrigues, V (corresponding author), Museu Paraense Emilio Goeldi, Programa Posgrad Bot Trop, Belem, Para, Brazil.; Negrao-Rodrigues, V (corresponding author), Univ Fed Rural Amazonia, Belem, Para, Brazil.",vanessanegraorodrigues@gmail.com,"Teodoro, Grazielle S/K-2586-2014; Negr√£o-Rodrigues, Vanessa/JBS-3983-2023; Marques-Azevedo, Mario Jose/G-2389-2018","Teodoro, Grazielle S/0000-0002-5528-8828; Negr√£o-Rodrigues, Vanessa/0000-0003-0400-9152; Marques-Azevedo, Mario Jose/0000-0002-1868-5306",Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior - Brazil (CAPES) [001]; National Science Foundation (NSF) award [175483],Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior - Brazil (CAPES)(Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES)); National Science Foundation (NSF) award(National Science Foundation (NSF)),VNR was supported with a master scholarship by CoordenacAo de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior - Brazil (CAPES) - Finance Code 001.

While in-line particle holography (PH) can provide high-resolution measurements of particles, it suffers from speckle noise. Plenoptic imaging (PI) is less susceptible to speckle noises, but it involves a trade-off between spatial and angular resolution, rendering images with low resolution. Here, we report a simple microscopy setup with the goals of getting the strengths of both techniques.

It also allows us to understand the working principle of pupil plane modulation clearly, benefiting microscopy education.

Spraying during stable atmospheric conditions should be avoided to prevent surface-temperature inversion-induced off-target drift of crop protection materials. Previous statistical analysis determined times of high likelihood of stable atmospheric conditions, which are unfavorable for spraying, during the day under clear and cloudy conditions in hot summer months in the Mississippi Delta. Results validated the thresholds of temperature increase in the morning and temperature drop in the afternoon with wind speeds and the transition between stable and unstable atmospheric conditions. With this information, an algorithm was developed to calculate if atmospheric conditions were favorable for spraying based on field temperature and wind speed at any instant. With this algorithm, a web application was built to provide real-time determination of atmospheric stability and hourly online recommendation of whether aerial applications were appropriate for a location and time in the Mississippi Delta. This study further developed another web application specifically for Stoneville, Mississippi, with data measured from weather stations constructed from inexpensive open-source electronics, accessories, and software for more accurate online guidance for site-specific drift management. The web application is adapted for accessing on mobile terminals, such as smartphones and tablets, and provides timely guidance for aerial applicators and producers to avoid spray drift and air quality issues long distances downwind in the area.","[Huang, Y.; Fisher, D.

Since it is the most labor-intensive stage in the nearly all-analytical protocols, sample preparation automation would be desirable, to increase the analytical throughput, maintaining precision and accuracy, while preventing risks of human exposure to chemical or biological agents. Among different lab-automation strategies, robots have long been an important prospect. Nevertheless, widespread adoption of dedicate ""robot-chemist"" with analytical purposes continues being limited. Open resources that enable non-specialist analysts and researchers to make their own prototypes are still necessary. We have assembled an open-source innovative platform, able to guarantee the online hyphenation of the sample preparation microtechniques with liquid chromatography, mass spectrometry or any other detection system. It is a multi-purpose cartesian robot, programmed to perform sample clean-up operations, allowing the automated pre-concentration of analytes through the performance of solid and liquid phase microextraction protocols, actuating a microextraction syringe driver, and equipped with an in-syringe-stirring mechanism and an adapted interface for online coupling with liquid chromatography or mass spectrometry analysis. The entire sample preparation procedure can be performed by the developed prototype and the enriched extract automatically injected into the separation and detection system. The analytical performance of the developed prototype was assessed for the extraction of polyaromatic hydrocarbons from sewage water, by headspace dynamic single drop microextraction (SDME), dynamic hollow-fiber liquid phase microextraction (HF-LPME) and microextraction by packed sorbent (MEPS). The developed prototype displayed excellent precision and accuracy for the execution of the microextraction protocols, proving to be a promising and competitive open source analytical tool able to extend the state-of-the-art of sample preparation microtechniques.

In this work, a low cost data acquisition system (Geophonino) has been developed for recording seismic signals from a vertical geophone. The signal goes first through an instrumentation amplifier, INA155, which is suitable for low amplitude signals like the seismic noise, and an anti-aliasing filter based on the MAX7404 switched-capacitor filter. After that, the amplified and filtered signal is digitized and processed by Arduino Due and registered in an SD memory card. Geophonino is configured for continuous registering, where the sampling frequency, the amplitude gain and the registering time are user-defined. The complete prototype is an open source and open hardware system. It has been tested by comparing the registered signals with the ones obtained through different commercial data recording systems and different kind of geophones. The obtained results show good correlation between the tested measurements, presenting Geophonino as a low-cost alternative system for seismic data recording. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

The calibration curve for the range from 50 to 200 mu M was found to be linear with a correlation coefficient of r= 0.9994. A good reproducibility was obtained (3% relative standard deviation) and the limit of detection was determined as 8 mu M.

Common approaches for measuring liquid intake in real time include computer-tethered lickometers or video-based systems. Additionally, liquids can be measured or weighed to determine the amount consumed without real-time sensing. Here, we built a photobeam-based sipper device that has the following advantages over traditional methods: (1) it is battery powered and fits in vivarium caging to allow home-measurements; (2) it quantifies the intake of two different liquids simultaneously for preference studies; (3) it is low cost and easily constructed, enabling high-throughput experiments; and (4) it is open source so that others can modify it to fit their experimental needs. We validated the performance of this device in three experiments. First, we calibrated our device using time-lapse video-based measurements of liquid intake and correlated sipper interactions with liquid intake. Second, we used the sipper device to measure preference for water versus chocolate milk, demonstrating its utility for two-bottle choice tasks. Third, we integrated the device with fiber photometry, establishing its utility for measuring neural activity in studies of ingestive behavior. This device requires no special equipment or caging, and is small, battery powered, and wireless, allowing it to be placed directly in rodent home cages. The total cost of fabrication is less than $100, and all design files and code are open source. Together, these factors greatly increase scalability and utility for a variety of behavioral neuroscience applications.","[Godynyuk, Elizabeth; Tooley, Jessica R.; Kravitz, Alexxai, V; Creed, Meaghan C.] Washington Univ, Dept Anesthesiol, St Louis, MO 63108 USA; [Bluitt, Maya N.; Kravitz, Alexxai, V; Creed, Meaghan C.] Washington Univ, Dept Psychiat, St Louis, MO 63108 USA; [Kravitz, Alexxai, V; Creed, Meaghan C.] Washington Univ, Dept Neurosci, St Louis, MO 63108 USA; [Kravitz, Alexxai, V; Creed, Meaghan C.] Washington Univ, Dept Biomed Engn, St Louis, MO 63108 USA",Washington University (WUSTL); Washington University (WUSTL); Washington University (WUSTL); Washington University (WUSTL),"Creed, MC (corresponding author), Washington Univ, Dept Anesthesiol, St Louis, MO 63108 USA.; Creed, MC (corresponding author), Washington Univ, Dept Psychiat, St Louis, MO 63108 USA.; Creed, MC (corresponding author), Washington Univ, Dept Neurosci, St Louis, MO 63108 USA.; Creed, MC (corresponding author), Washington Univ, Dept Biomed Engn, St Louis, MO 63108 USA.",Meaghan.creed@wustl.edu,"Creed, Meaghan/AAW-8136-2021","Tooley, Jessica/0000-0001-8602-6794; Godynyuk, Elizabeth/0000-0003-0740-4473","Washington University in St. Louis; Brain and Behavior Research Foundation (NARSAD) [27461, 27197]; National Institutes of Health National Institute on Drug Abuse Cutting-Edge Basic Research Award [R21-DA-047127]; Whitehall Foundation [2017-12-54]; Rita Allen Scholar Award in Pain",Washington University in St. Louis; Brain and Behavior Research Foundation (NARSAD)(NARSAD); National Institutes of Health National Institute on Drug Abuse Cutting-Edge Basic Research Award; Whitehall Foundation; Rita Allen Scholar Award in Pain,"This research was supported by internal funds from Washington University in St. Louis (to A.V.K. and M.C.C.), the Brain and Behavior Research Foundation (NARSAD Young Investigator Grant #27461 to A.V.K., Grant #27197 to M.C.C.), National Institutes of Health National Institute on Drug Abuse Cutting-Edge Basic Research Award (Grant R21-DA-047127), Whitehall Foundation Grant (#2017-12-54), and Rita Allen Scholar Award in Pain (to M.C.C.).",,34,24,32,1,4,SOC NEUROSCIENCE,WASHINGTON,"11 DUPONT CIRCLE, NW, STE 500, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA",,2373-2822,,ENEURO,eNeuro,SEP-OCT,2019,6,5,,,,,,,UNSP ENEURO.0292-19.2019,10.1523/ENEURO.0292-19.2019,http://dx.doi.org/10.1523/ENEURO.0292-19.2019,,,9,Neurosciences,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Neurosciences & Neurology,JJ6QC,31533961,"Green Published, gold",,,8/15/24,WOS:000494278900042,,0,419,,,

These systems should be able to execute safety-critical applications but, at the same time, to run non-safety-critical functionalities without affecting the integrity of the safetycritical tasks. This paper presents a new system architecture which includes safetycritical and non-safety-critical parts in order to form a mixed-criticality system. The system consists of a reliable platform with a dual-core processor (implemented using a FPGA) architecture designed as open-hardware, running two isolated real-time operating systems which are connected through a safe core-to-core communication channel that executes the safety-critical applications. Moreover, the safety-critical system is connected to an external processor, an ARM9, which is used as an external sensing system. The ARM9 runs the non-safety-critical applications and allows the system to insert modifications updating without affecting the safety capabilities of the safetycritical part. This platform is described providing evidences of the isolation between safety-critical (SC) and non-safety-critical (NSC) applications, as well as describing an updating methodology for non-safety-critical applications.

Most systems available to the public have price tags in the thousands of dollars and their dimensions cannot be easily customized. Current systems have a maximum length of about ten meters, and for a typical greenhouse application that length may not be sufficient. The price of the system increases with an increase in length, and with a base price in the thousands of dollars it becomes impractical to buy a system for such application. Our HyperRail is a modular linear motion system with a repeatability of 2 mm and current top speed of 200 mm/s. This is possible through a stepper motor driver that allows for 1/16th microstepping giving an average of 6180 steps per revolution. An advantage that this system has is its ability to increase or decrease the length of system with minimum effort and only nominal increase in price. The HyperRail can be mounted on a set of tripods or directly on the structure of a building such as a greenhouse. The base price for a three-meter system, on tripods is US$278 and only US$45 for each additional 1.5 m of length. (C) 2019 The Authors.

Mechanosensitive ion channels (MSCs), especially ones of Piezo family (Piezo1 and Piezo2), play a crucial role in mechanotransduction. These transmembrane proteins directly react to mechanical cues by triggering the onset of an ionic current. The relevance of this mechanism in driving physiology and pathology is emerging, and there is a growing need for the identification of an affordable and reliable assay to measure it. Setting up a mechanosensitivity assay requires exerting a mechanical stimulus on single cells while observing the downstream effects of channels opening. We propose an open-hardware approach to stimulate single adherent cells through controlled microindentation, using a 3D-printed actuation platform. We validated the device by measuring the mechanosensitivity of a neural mice cell line where the expression level and activity of Piezo1 were genetically and pharmacologically manipulated. Moreover, this extremely versatile device could be integrated with different read-out technologies, offering a new tool to improve the understanding of mechanotransduction in living cells.","[Capponi, Giulio; Neri, Igor; Cottone, Francesco; Mattarelli, Maurizio] Univ Perugia, Dipartimento Fis & Geol, I-06100 Perugia, Italy; [Capponi, Giulio; Zambito, Martina; Florio, Tullio] Univ Genoa, Sez Farmacol, Dipartimento Med Interna, I-16132 Genoa, Italy; [Vassalli, Massimo] Univ Glasgow, James Watt Sch Engn, Glasgow G12 8LT, Lanark, Scotland; [Caponi, Silvia] Univ Perugia, Ist Officina Mat, Italian Natl Res Council IOM CNR, Unit Perugia,Dept Phys & Geol, Via A Pascoli, I-06123 Perugia, Italy; [Florio, Tullio] Osped Policlin San Martino, Ist Ricovero & Cura Carattere Sci, I-16132 Genoa, Italy",University of Perugia; University of Genoa; University of Glasgow; Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche (CNR); Istituto Officina dei Materiali (IOM-CNR); University of Perugia,"Capponi, G (corresponding author), Univ Perugia, Dipartimento Fis & Geol, I-06100 Perugia, Italy.; Capponi, G; Florio, T (corresponding author), Univ Genoa, Sez Farmacol, Dipartimento Med Interna, I-16132 Genoa, Italy.; Vassalli, M (corresponding author), Univ Glasgow, James Watt Sch Engn, Glasgow G12 8LT, Lanark, Scotland.; Florio, T (corresponding author), Osped Policlin San Martino, Ist Ricovero & Cura Carattere Sci, I-16132 Genoa, Italy.",giulio.capponi@studenti.unipg.it; massimo.vassalli@glasgow.ac.uk; tullio.florio@unige.it,"Neri, Igor/F-1482-2010; Florio, Tullio/A-2211-2012; CAPONI, SILVIA/F-9821-2010; Mattarelli, Maurizio/C-5337-2008; Vassalli, Massimo/F-6762-2011","Neri, Igor/0000-0002-9047-9822; Florio, Tullio/0000-0002-2394-996X; Zambito, Martina/0009-0006-3970-172X; COTTONE, FRANCESCO/0000-0003-4920-5907; CAPONI, SILVIA/0000-0002-4219-3256; Mattarelli, Maurizio/0000-0001-9184-7968; Vassalli, Massimo/0000-0002-3063-4376; Capponi, Giulio/0000-0003-1491-9483",European Social Fund (ESF)-Regione Liguria (POR FSE 2014-2020); Royal Society International Exchange [nR2 n202232],European Social Fund (ESF)-Regione Liguria (POR FSE 2014-2020)(European Social Fund (ESF)); Royal Society International Exchange(Royal Society),This research was co-funded by the European Social Fund (ESF)-Regione Liguria (POR FSE 2014-2020).

An automated high-throughput protocol was developed demonstrating the synthesis of CdSe nanocrystals using sonochemistry and different combinations of sample conditions, including precursor and ligand compositions and concentrations. Cavitation caused by ultrasound fields causes local and transient increases in temperature and pressure sufficient to drive the decomposition of organometallic precursors to drive the chemical reaction leading to nanocrystal formation. A total of 625 unique sample conditions were prepared and analyzed in triplicate with an individual sample volume of as little as 0.5 mL, which drastically reduced chemical waste and experimental times. The rapid onset of cavitation and quick dissipation of energy result in fast nucleation with little nanocrystal growth leading to the formation of small nanocrystals or magic-size clusters (MSCs) depending on composition. Using the effective mass approximation, the calculated QD diameters obtained under all our experimental conditions ranged between 1.3 and 2.1 nm, which was also validated with small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS). Polydispersity, QD shape and optical properties largely varied depending on the concentration of ligands present in solution. Statistical analysis of the spectroscopic data corroborates the qualitative relationships observed from the optical characterization of the samples with the model-agnostic SHAP analysis. The complete workflow relies on relatively low-cost and open-source systems. Automation and the reduced volumes also allow for cost-efficient experimentation, increasing the accessibility of this MAP. The high-throughput capabilities of the automated sonication platform, the extensible nature of the Jubilee system, and the modular nature of the protocol, make the workflow adaptable to a variety of future studies, including other nanocrystal design spaces, emulsification processes, and nanoparticle re-dispersion or exfoliation. A sonochemical Materials Acceleration Platform was implemented to synthesize CdSe nanocrystals under 625 unique conditions (in triplicate) in less than 6 weeks. The modularity of the workflow is adaptable to a variety of applications.","[Politi, Maria; Baum, Fabio; Vaddi, Kiran; Antonio, Edwin; Bishop, Brittany P.; Holmberg, Vincent C.; Pozzo, Lilo D.] Univ Washington, Dept Chem Engn, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Vasquez, Joshua; Peek, Nadya] Univ Washington, Dept Human Ctr Design & Engn, Seattle, WA USA",University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle; University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle,"Pozzo, LD (corresponding author), Univ Washington, Dept Chem Engn, Seattle, WA 98195 USA.",dpozzo@uw.edu,,"Politi, Maria/0000-0002-5815-3371; Pozzo, Lilo/0000-0001-7104-9061","This project was supported by the National Science Foundation through NSF-CBET grant no. 1917340, the Data Intensive Research Enabling Clean Technology (DIRECT) National Science Foundation (NSF) National Research Traineeship (DGE-1633216), and the UW Molec [1917340]; National Science Foundation through NSF-CBET [DGE-1633216]; Data Intensive Research Enabling Clean Technology (DIRECT) National Science Foundation (NSF) National Research Traineeship [DMR-1719797]; UW Molecular Engineering Materials Center [DMR-2116265]; U.S. National Science Foundation through the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) program; University of Washington, Department of Chemical Engineering; Joint Center for Deployment and Research in Earth Abundant Materials; state of Washington through the University of Washington Clean Energy Institute; UW eScience Institute","This project was supported by the National Science Foundation through NSF-CBET grant no. 1917340, the Data Intensive Research Enabling Clean Technology (DIRECT) National Science Foundation (NSF) National Research Traineeship (DGE-1633216), and the UW Molec; National Science Foundation through NSF-CBET; Data Intensive Research Enabling Clean Technology (DIRECT) National Science Foundation (NSF) National Research Traineeship; UW Molecular Engineering Materials Center; U.S. National Science Foundation through the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) program(National Science Foundation (NSF)); University of Washington, Department of Chemical Engineering; Joint Center for Deployment and Research in Earth Abundant Materials; state of Washington through the University of Washington Clean Energy Institute; UW eScience Institute","This project was supported by the National Science Foundation through NSF-CBET grant no. 1917340, the Data Intensive Research Enabling Clean Technology (DIRECT) National Science Foundation (NSF) National Research Traineeship (DGE-1633216), and the UW Molecular Engineering Materials Center, a Materials Research Science and Engineering Center (Grant No. DMR-1719797).

However, combining 2P imaging with spectrally arbitrary light stimulation can be challenging due to crosstalk between stimulation light and fluorescence detection. To overcome this limitation, we present a simple and low-cost electronic solution based on an ESP32 microcontroller and a TLC5947 LED driver to rapidly time-interleave stimulation and detection epochs during scans. Implemented for less than $100, our design can independently drive up to 24 arbitrary spectrum LEDs to meet user requirements. We demonstrate the utility of our stimulator for colour vision experiments on the in vivo tetrachromatic zebrafish retina and for optogenetic circuit mapping in Drosophila. (C) 2020 The Authors.

However, since the absolute power in EEG decreases rapidly with increasing frequency following a ""1/f"" power law, and the gamma band includes line noise frequency, these oscillations are highly susceptible to instrument noise. Previous studies that recorded stimulus-induced gamma oscillations used expensive research-grade EEG amplifiers to address this issue. While low-cost EEG amplifiers have become popular in Brain Computer Interface applications that mainly rely on low-frequency oscillations (< 30 Hz) or steady-state-visually-evoked-potentials, whether they can also be used to measure stimulus-induced gamma oscillations is unknown. We recorded EEG signals using a low-cost, open-source amplifier (OpenBCI) and a traditional, research-grade amplifier (Brain Products GmbH), both connected to the OpenBCI cap, in male (N = 6) and female (N = 5) subjects (22-29 years) while they viewed full-screen static gratings that are known to induce two distinct gamma oscillations: slow and fast gamma, in a subset of subjects. While the EEG signals from OpenBCI were considerably noisier, we found that out of the seven subjects who showed a gamma response in Brain Products recordings, six showed a gamma response in OpenBCI as well. In spite of the noise in the OpenBCI setup, the spectral and temporal profiles of these responses in alpha (8-13 Hz) and gamma bands were highly correlated between OpenBCI and Brain Products recordings. These results suggest that low-cost amplifiers can potentially be used in stimulus-induced gamma response detection.","[Pattisapu, Srividya; Ray, Supratim] Indian Inst Sci, Ctr Neurosci, Bengaluru, India",Indian Institute of Science (IISC) - Bangalore,"Ray, S (corresponding author), Indian Inst Sci, Ctr Neurosci, Bengaluru, India.",sray@iisc.ac.in,,"Ray, Supratim/0000-0002-1968-1382; Pattisapu, Srividya/0000-0001-7047-1754",Wellcome Trust/DBT India Alliance [IA/S/18/2/504003]; DBT-IISc Partnership Programme,Wellcome Trust/DBT India Alliance(Wellcome TrustWellcome Trust DBT India Alliance); DBT-IISc Partnership Programme(Newton-Al-Farabi Partnership Programme),"This work was supported by Wellcome Trust/DBT India Alliance (Senior fellowship IA/S/18/2/504003 to S.R.), and DBT-IISc Partnership Programme.

Samples were instrumentally processed in a relatively short time, and neither an intentional reduction of the linear flow rate nor an unconventional fluorescence instrument were required. Through the inclusion of external circuitry based on open-source hardware, the occurrence time of each individual fluorescence intensity reading was recorded. For the reported instrumental setup, irregular signal sampling was verified. In order to consider samples-specific time measurements, the PARAFAC (Parallel Factor Analysis) algorithm, and the derived APARAFAC (Augmented-PARAFAC) strategy, were adapted. The functional information was employed during the computational stages, through the development and implementation of smoothing strategies. To tackle differences between the rate of spectral acquisition and the rate of change in the concentration of the mobile fluorophores, Expectation Maximization was implemented. Data from samples with one calibrated analyze (Vitamin B6-Pyridoxine), in presence of uncalibrated interferents, were modeled. In order to preserve the original data structure, unfolding data operations were minimized. The resolved profiles of all species were in agreement with the corresponding chromatographic and spectral references. Results suggest that the effects derived from the loss of trilinearity previously reported in the literature for LC-EEM data, depend on interpretation and subsequent modeling of the data. The reported strategies can be useful with other flow techniques and kinetics.","[Siano, Gabriel G.; Giovanini, Leonardo L.] FICH UNL CONICET, Sinc I, Inst Invest Senales Sistemas & Inteligencia Com, Ciudad Univ UNL,S3000ZAA, Santa Fe, Argentina; [Siano, Gabriel G.] FBCB UNL, Catedra Quim Analit 2, Ciudad Univ UNL,S3000ZAA, Santa Fe, Argentina; [Vera Candioti, Luciana] FBCB UNL, Catedra Bromatol & Nutr, Ciudad Univ UNL,S3000ZAA, Santa Fe, Argentina; [Vera Candioti, Luciana] Consejo Nacl Invest Cient & Tecn, Godoy Cruz 2290,C1425FQB, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina",National University of the Littoral; National University of the Littoral; Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Cientificas y Tecnicas (CONICET),"Siano, GG (corresponding author), FICH UNL CONICET, Sinc I, Inst Invest Senales Sistemas & Inteligencia Com, Ciudad Univ UNL,S3000ZAA, Santa Fe, Argentina.",gsiano@sinc.unl.edu.ar,,,"CONICET (Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Cientificas y Tecnicas) [PIP-2015, 0111]",CONICET (Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Cientificas y Tecnicas)(Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Cientificas y Tecnicas (CONICET)),"The authors express their gratitude to CONICET (Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Cientificas y Tecnicas, Project PIP-2015 No. 0111) for financially supporting this work.

Such systems often require to be multi-modal and multi-channel capable of acquiring and processing several different types of physiological signals simultaneously in realtime. Developments of modular and scalable electrophysiological data acquisition systems for experimental research enhance understanding and progress in the field. To contribute to such an endeavor, we present an open-source hardware project called High-Channel Count Electrophysiology or HiCCE, targeting to produce an easily-adaptable, cost-effective, and affordable electrophysiological acquisition system as an alternative solution for mostly available commercial tools and the current state of the art in the field. In this paper, we describe the design and validation of the entire chain of the HiCCE-128 electrophysiological data acquisition system. The system comprises of 128 independent channels capable of acquiring signal at 31.25 kHz, with 16 effective bits per channel with a measured noise level of about 3 fiV. The reliability and feasibility of the implemented system have been confirmed through a series of tests and real-world applications. The modular design methodology based on the FPGA Mezzanine Card (FMC) standard allows the connection of the HiCCE-128 board to programmable system-on-chip carrier devices through the high-speed FMC link. The implemented architecture enables end users to add various high-response electrophysiological signal processing techniques in the field programmable gate arrays (FPGA) part of the system on chip (SoC) device on each channel in parallel according to application specification.","[Mannatunga, Kasun Sameera; Samarawikrama, Jayathu G.] Univ Moratuwa, Fac Engn, Dept Elect & Telecommun Engn, Moratuwa 10400, Sri Lanka; [Mannatunga, Kasun Sameera] Univ Sri Jayewardenepura, Dept Phys, Fac Sci Appl, Nugegoda 10250, Sri Lanka; [Mannatunga, Kasun Sameera; Crespo, Maria Liz; Cicuttin, Andres] Abdus Salaam Int Ctr Theoret Phys, Multidisciplinary Lab, I-34100 Trieste, Italy; [Ali, Sawal Hamid Md] Univ Kebangsaan Malaysia, Fac Engn & Built Environm, Dept Elect & Syst Engn, Bangi 43600, Malaysia",University Moratuwa; University Sri Jayewardenepura; Abdus Salam International Centre for Theoretical Physics (ICTP); Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia,"Mannatunga, KS (corresponding author), Univ Moratuwa, Fac Engn, Dept Elect & Telecommun Engn, Moratuwa 10400, Sri Lanka.; Mannatunga, KS (corresponding author), Univ Sri Jayewardenepura, Dept Phys, Fac Sci Appl, Nugegoda 10250, Sri Lanka.; Mannatunga, KS (corresponding author), Abdus Salaam Int Ctr Theoret Phys, Multidisciplinary Lab, I-34100 Trieste, Italy.",ksm@sjp.ac.lk,"Cicuttin, Andres/ABD-6130-2020; Cicuttin, Andres/ABD-9204-2020; Ali, Sawal Hamid Md/M-3781-2016; Mannatunga, Kasun Sameera/G-6225-2018","Ali, Sawal Hamid Md/0000-0002-4819-863X; Crespo, Maria Liz/0000-0002-5483-3388; Mannatunga, Kasun Sameera/0000-0001-5777-9885","OPEC Fund for International Development (OFID) Postgraduate Fellowship Programme at International Centre for Theoretical Physics (ICTP); International Centre for Theoretical Physics/International Atomic Energy Agency Sandwich Training Educational Programme; Ministry of Education, Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia, Malaysia [FRGS/1/2018/TK04/UKM/02/2]","OPEC Fund for International Development (OFID) Postgraduate Fellowship Programme at International Centre for Theoretical Physics (ICTP); International Centre for Theoretical Physics/International Atomic Energy Agency Sandwich Training Educational Programme; Ministry of Education, Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia, Malaysia","This work was supported in part by the OPEC Fund for International Development (OFID) Postgraduate Fellowship Programme at International Centre for Theoretical Physics (ICTP), in part by the International Centre for Theoretical Physics/International Atomic Energy Agency Sandwich Training Educational Programme, and in part by the Ministry of Education, Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia, Malaysia under Grant FRGS/1/2018/TK04/UKM/02/2.",,68,5,6,1,14,IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC,PISCATAWAY,"445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA",2169-3536,,,IEEE ACCESS,IEEE Access,,2020,8,,,,,,122366,122383,,10.1109/ACCESS.2020.3007082,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2020.3007082,,,18,"Computer Science, Information Systems; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Telecommunications",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Computer Science; Engineering; Telecommunications,MR6ZH,,"Green Submitted, gold",,,8/15/24,WOS:000553740800001,,0,429,,,

One way of achieving synchronization involves marking distinct events with electrical pulses (event markers or ""TTL pulses""), which are continuously recorded with research hardware, and can later be temporally aligned. Traditionally, this event marking was often performed using the parallel port in standard personal computers. However, the parallel port is disappearing from the landscape of computer hardware, being replaced by a serial (COM) port, namely the USB port. To find an adequate replacement for the parallel port, we evaluated four microcontroller units (MCUs) and the LabJack U3, an often-used USB data acquisition device, in terms of their latency and jitter for sending event markers in a simulated experiment on both Windows and Linux. Our results show that all four MCUs were comparable to the parallel port in terms of both latency and jitter, and consistently achieved latencies under 1 ms. With some caveats, the LabJack U3 can also achieve comparable latencies. In addition to the collected data, we share extensive documentation on how to build and use MCUs for event marking, including code examples. MCUs are a cost-effective, flexible, and performant replacement for the disappearing parallel port, enabling event marking and synchronization of data streams.","[Appelhoff, Stefan] Max Planck Inst Human Dev, Ctr Adapt Rat, Lentzeallee 94, D-14195 Berlin, Germany; [Stenner, Tristan] Univ Kiel, Univ Med Ctr Schleswig Holstein, Inst Med Psychol & Med Sociol, Kiel, Germany",Max Planck Society; University of Kiel; Schleswig Holstein University Hospital,"Appelhoff, S (corresponding author), Max Planck Inst Human Dev, Ctr Adapt Rat, Lentzeallee 94, D-14195 Berlin, Germany.",appelhoff@mpib-berlin.mpg.de,,"Appelhoff, Stefan/0000-0001-8002-0877; Stenner, Tristan/0000-0002-2428-9051",Fellow-Programm Freies Wissen of Wikimedia Germany; Stifterverband; VolkswagenStiftung,Fellow-Programm Freies Wissen of Wikimedia Germany; Stifterverband; VolkswagenStiftung(Volkswagen),"This project was supported by the Fellow-Programm Freies Wissen of Wikimedia Germany, the Stifterverband, and the VolkswagenStiftung.

The developed software operates on a widely available, low-cost open hardware platform. Experiments were performed with nine healthy individuals. When comparing the experimental results to those obtained with a reference pulse oximeter, the proposed solution showed good accuracy in SpO(2) measurements, with a difference of less than 2%, meeting the requirements of the standard that regulates pulse oximetry equipment.","[Galvao Rosa, Alessandra de Fatima; Betini, Roberto Cesar] Univ Tecnol Fed Parana UTFPR, Apucarana, Brazil; [Galvao Rosa, Alessandra de Fatima] Inst Carlos Chagas ICC FIOCRUZ, Curitiba, Parana, Brazil",Universidade Tecnologica Federal do Parana; Fundacao Oswaldo Cruz,"Rosa, ADG (corresponding author), Univ Tecnol Fed Parana UTFPR, Apucarana, Brazil.; Rosa, ADG (corresponding author), Inst Carlos Chagas ICC FIOCRUZ, Curitiba, Parana, Brazil.",alessandrarosa@alunos.utfpr.edu.br; betini@utfpr.edu.br,,,,,,,38,0,0,0,9,UNIV PASSO FUNDO,PASSO FUNDO,"CAIXA POSTAL 611, PASSO FUNDO, RS 99001-970, BRAZIL",2176-6649,,,REV BRAS COMPUT APL,Rev.

The 16 raceway tanks allow up to 6x water renewal per hour, avoiding changes in natural abiotic seawater conditions. We use an open-source hardware board (Arduino) that was adapted to control heaters and an innovative CO2 injection system. This system reduced seawater pH up to -0.9 units and increased temperature up to +6 degrees C in three treatments and a control. Treatments can be continuously compared with the control and vary according to diel fluctuations, thus following the diel range observed in the sea. The mesocosm facility also includes an integrated secondary system of 48 aquaria for ecotoxicology studies. We validated the reproducibility and relevance of our experimental system by analyzing the variation of the total DNA of the microbial community extracted from corals in three elevated temperature scenarios during a 40-day experiment. We also present data from temperature, acidification, and copper contamination trials, which allowed continuous, reliable, and consistent treatment manipulations.","[Duarte, Gustavo; Calderon, Emiliano N.; Pereira, Cristiano M.; Marangoni, Laura F.

Preparative liquid chromatography was implemented with a reverse phase gradient from MeOH to toluene. The system allows three solvents and fractions changes by using quaternary valves connected to an Arduino microcontroller, programmed on the basis of the absorbance signal measured and its first derivative. Additionally, the method was applied to crude oils (Venezuelan National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) 8505 and from a marine reservoir). V and Ni were determined by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) and the V-porphyrin profile was determined by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC)-ICP-MS. The concentrations of the metals grow in the last eluting toluene fractions, associated with asphaltenes. On the other hand, V-porphyrins in the first eluting MeOH fractions showed profiles of labile compounds, with a higher percentage in the Brazilian crude oil (4.9 mg L-1, corresponding to 18% of total V), in comparison to the one from the biodegraded NIST 8505 (59 mg L-1, corresponding to 7% of total V). The overall methodology has a good reproducibility and provides information on elements concentrations associated with porphyrin class compounds.","[Silva, Daniel M.; Pereira, Alvaro J.; Saint'Pierre, Tatiana D.] Pontificia Univ Catolica Rio de Janeiro PUG Rio, R Marques de Sao Vicente 225, BR-22451900 Rio De Janeiro, RJ, Brazil; [Esteves, Pierre M.] Univ Fed Rio de Janeiro UFRJ, Inst Quim, BR-21941909 Rio De Janeiro, RJ, Brazil; [Rocha, Anderson A.; Duyck, Christiane] Univ Fed Fluminense, Dept Quim Analit, Outeiro Sao Joao Batista S-N, BR-24020141 Niteroi, RJ, Brazil; [Escalfoni Jr, Rainerio] Petrobras SA, Ctr Pesquisa Leopoldo Americo Miguez de Mello Cen, Av Jequitiba 950, BR-21941598 Rio De Janeiro, RJ, Brazil",Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro; Universidade Federal Fluminense; Petrobras,"Esteves, PM (corresponding author), Univ Fed Rio de Janeiro UFRJ, Inst Quim, BR-21941909 Rio De Janeiro, RJ, Brazil.; Duyck, C (corresponding author), Univ Fed Fluminense, Dept Quim Analit, Outeiro Sao Joao Batista S-N, BR-24020141 Niteroi, RJ, Brazil.",pesteves@iq.ufrj.br; cbduyck@id.uff.br,"Silva, Du√≠lio M Z A/E-9013-2014; Rocha, Anderson/KHU-9621-2024; Rocha, Anderson/ABA-8662-2020; Saint'Pierre, Tatiana Dillenburg/E-2965-2015; Duyck, Christiane/AEJ-1818-2022; Esteves, Pierre Mothe/G-3132-2011","Rocha, Anderson/0000-0001-5179-1146; Duyck, Christiane/0000-0002-2837-4173; Saint Pierre, Tatiana/0000-0002-7619-5620; Esteves, Pierre Mothe/0000-0001-6048-4690",Brazilian Petroleum Company (Petrobras); Brazilian National Research Council (CNPq),Brazilian Petroleum Company (Petrobras)(Petrobras); Brazilian National Research Council (CNPq)(Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPQ)),"The authors thank the Brazilian Petroleum Company (Petrobras) for the funding and in particular Flavio Albuquerque, Marco Antonio Teixeira and Rosana Cardoso, for the valuable contributions in porphyrins separation.

There is a growing demand for in situ iceberg tracking data to monitor their drift trajectories and improve models used for operational forecasting of ice hazards, yet the high cost of commercial tracking devices often prevents monitoring at optimal spatial and temporal resolutions. Here, we provide a detailed description of the Cryologger Ice Tracking Beacon (ITB), a low-cost, robust, and user-friendly data logger and telemeter for tracking icebergs and ice islands based on the Arduino open-source electronics platform. Designed for deployments of at least 2 years with an hourly sampling interval that is remotely modifiable by the end user, the Cryologger ITB provides long-term measurements of position, temperature, pressure, pitch, roll, heading, and battery voltage. Data are transmitted via the Iridium satellite network at user-specified intervals. We present the results of field campaigns in 2018 and 2019, which saw the deployment of 16 ITBs along the coasts of Greenland and Ellesmere and Baffin islands. The overall success of these ITB deployments has demonstrated that inexpensive, open-source hardware and software can provide a reliable and cost-effective method of monitoring icebergs and ice islands in the polar regions.","[Garbo, Adam; Mueller, Derek] Carleton Univ, Dept Geog & Environm Studies, Water & Ice Res Lab, 1125 Colonel By Drive, Ottawa, ON K1S 5B6, Canada",Carleton University,"Garbo, A (corresponding author), Carleton Univ, Dept Geog & Environm Studies, Water & Ice Res Lab, 1125 Colonel By Drive, Ottawa, ON K1S 5B6, Canada.",adam.garbo@carleton.ca,,"Garbo, Adam/0000-0002-7312-7390; Mueller, Derek/0000-0003-1974-319X","ArcticNet, a Network of Centers of Excellence of Canada","ArcticNet, a Network of Centers of Excellence of Canada","This project would not have been possible without the designs, software, and tutorials provided by the open-source community.

The resulting TIE images are quantitative phase maps of unstained biological samples. Therefore, spatially resolved optical path length (OPL) information can also be determined. Using low-cost, open-source hardware, we applied the TIE to living algal cells to measure their effect on OPL. We obtained OPL values that were repeatable within species and differed by distinct amounts depending on the species being measured. We suggest TIE imaging as a method of discrimination between different algal species and, potentially, non-biological materials, based on refractive index/OPL.

The transistor biasing condition for achieving near-zero temperature dependence is derived. With this, a dynamic biasing technique is proposed to stabilize the output power of the PA over a wide temperature range. A prototype class-E PA was designed and fabricated in a 0.18-mu m CMOS process. Operating at 477 MHz, the PA has 4 output stages and the measured maximum output variation is about +/- 0.3 dB from -40 degrees C to 85 degrees C.

Although these methods are relatively cheaper than other geotechnical techniques, the cost of the sensors and the multi-channel data acquisition system means that small research groups cannot afford this kind of equipment. In this work, two prototypes for registering seismic noise have been developed and implemented: a three-channel acquisition system, optimized for working with three-component sensors; and a twelve-channel acquisition system, prepared for working simultaneously with twelve vertical geophones. Both prototypes are characterized by being open-hardware, open-software, easy to implement, and low-cost. The main aim is to provide a data acquisition system that can be reproduced and applied by any research group. Both developed prototypes have been tested and compared with other commercial equipment, showing their suitability to register seismic noise and to estimate the soil characteristics.","[Luis Soler-Llorens, Juan; Juan Giner-Caturla, Jose] Univ Alicante, Dept Earth Sci & Environm, Crta San Vicente Raspeig S-N, E-03080 Alicante, Spain; [Jose Galiana-Merino, Juan; Youcef Nassim-Benabdeloued, Boualem; Ortiz Zamora, Javier] Univ Alicante, Dept Phys Syst Engn & Signal Theory, Crta San Vicente Raspeig S-N, E-03080 Alicante, Spain; [Jose Galiana-Merino, Juan; Rosa-Cintas, Sergio; Juan Giner-Caturla, Jose] Univ Alicante, Univ Inst Phys Appl Sci & Technol, Crta San Vicente Raspeig S-N, E-03080 Alicante, Spain; [Rosa-Cintas, Sergio] Univ Alicante, Fac Educ, Dept Gen Didact & Specif Didact, Crta San Vicente Raspeig S-N, E-03080 Alicante, Spain; [Youcef Nassim-Benabdeloued, Boualem] Univ Politecn Cataluna, Dept Fluid Mech, C Jordi Girona 31, Barcelona 08034, Spain",Universitat d'Alacant; Universitat d'Alacant; Universitat d'Alacant; Universitat d'Alacant; Universitat Politecnica de Catalunya,"Soler-Llorens, JL (corresponding author), Univ Alicante, Dept Earth Sci & Environm, Crta San Vicente Raspeig S-N, E-03080 Alicante, Spain.",jl.soler@ua.es; juanjo@dfists.ua.es; boualem.youcef.nassim.benabdel@upc.edu; sergio.rosacintas@ua.es; javier.ortiz@ua.es; jj.giner@ua.es,"Llorens, Juan Luis Soler/Y-9106-2019; Soler-Llorens, Juan Luis/I-7379-2016; GALIANA-MERINO, JUAN JOSE/L-1948-2014","Llorens, Juan Luis Soler/0000-0003-4540-8790; Soler-Llorens, Juan Luis/0000-0003-4540-8790; GALIANA-MERINO, JUAN JOSE/0000-0002-0818-2836; Benabdeloued, Boualem Youcef Nassim/0000-0001-7657-616X","Ministerio de Economia, Industria y Competitividad [CGL2016-77688-R]; Spanish MINECO under project EPILATES [CGL2015.65602-R]; European funds under project EPILATES [CGL2015.65602-R]; Regional Government of Comunidad Valenciana (Spain) [AICO/2016/098]","Ministerio de Economia, Industria y Competitividad; Spanish MINECO under project EPILATES; European funds under project EPILATES; Regional Government of Comunidad Valenciana (Spain)","This research was funded by the Ministerio de Economia, Industria y Competitividad (grant number CGL2016-77688-R AEI/FEDER, UE); Spanish MINECO and European funds under project EPILATES (grant number CGL2015.65602-R); and Regional Government of Comunidad Valenciana (Spain) (grant number AICO/2016/098).",,53,10,11,1,12,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2079-9292,,ELECTRONICS-SWITZ,Electronics,SEP,2019,8,9,,,,,,,1035,10.3390/electronics8091035,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/electronics8091035,,,21,"Computer Science, Information Systems; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Physics, Applied",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Computer Science; Engineering; Physics,JC2TC,,"Green Published, gold",,,8/15/24,WOS:000489128400122,,0,439,,,

To address this, we introduce OpenCell, an economical, open-source, 3-in-1 laboratory device that combines the functionalities of a bead homogenizer, a microcentrifuge, and a vortex mixer. OpenCell utilizes modular attachments that magnetically connect to a central rotating brushless motor. This motor couples to an epicyclic gearing mechanism, enabling efficient bead homogenization, vortex mixing, and centrifugation within one compact unit. OpenCell's design incorporates multiple redundant safety features, ensuring both the device's and operator's safety. Additional features such as RPM measurement, programmable timers, battery operation, and optional speed control make OpenCell a reliable and reproducible laboratory instrument. In our study, OpenCell successfully isolated DNA from Spinacia oleracea (spinach), with an average yield of 2.3 mu g and an A260/A280 ratio of 1.77, demonstrating its effectiveness for downstream applications such as Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) amplification. With its compact size (20 cm x 28 cm x 6.7 cm) and lightweight design (0.8 kg), comparable to the size and weight of a laptop, OpenCell is portable, making it an attractive component of a 'lab-in-a-backpack' for resource-constrained environments in low-and-middle-income countries and synthetic biology in remote field stations. Leveraging the accessibility of 3D printing and off-the-shelf components, OpenCell can be manufactured and assembled at a low unit cost of less than $50, providing an affordable alternative to expensive laboratory equipment costing over $4000. OpenCell aims to overcome the barriers to entry in synthetic biology research and contribute to the growing collection of frugal and open hardware.","[Gupta, Aryan] Georgia Inst Technol, Sch Elect & Comp Engn, Atlanta, GA USA; [Yu, Justin] Georgia Inst Technol, Sch Biol Sci, Atlanta, GA USA; [Challita, Elio J.; Standeven, Janet; Bhamla, M.

However, neural responses may vary due to prior experience, internal states, or stochastic factors, thus generating the need for methods that can assess neural function across many individuals at once. Whereas most recording techniques examine a single animal at a time, we describe the use of wide-field microscopy to scale up neuronal recordings to dozens of Caenorhabditis elegans or other sub-millimeter-scale organisms at once. Open-source hardware and software allow great flexibility in programming fully automated experiments that control the intensity and timing of various stimulus types, including chemical, optical, mechanical, thermal, and electromagnetic stimuli. In particular, microfluidic flow devices provide precise, repeatable, and quantitative control of chemosensory stimuli with sub-second time resolution. The NeuroTracker semi-automated data analysis pipeline then extracts individual and population-wide neural responses to uncover functional changes in neural excitability and dynamics. This paper presents examples of measuring neuronal adaptation, temporal inhibition, and stimulus crosstalk. These techniques increase the precision and repeatability of stimulation, allow the exploration of population variability, and are generalizable to other dynamic fluorescent signals in small biosystems from cells and organoids to whole organisms and plants.","[White, Hamilton; Kamara, Vanessa; Gorski, Veronika; Busby, Molly; Albrecht, Dirk R.] Worcester Polytech Inst, Dept Biomed Engn, Worcester, MA 01609 USA; [White, Hamilton] UMass Chan Med Sch, Grad Sch Biomed Sci, Worcester, MA USA; [Albrecht, Dirk R.] Worcester Polytech Inst, Dept Biol & Biotechnol, Worcester, MA 01609 USA",Worcester Polytechnic Institute; University of Massachusetts System; UMass Chan Medical School; Worcester Polytechnic Institute,"Albrecht, DR (corresponding author), Worcester Polytech Inst, Dept Biomed Engn, Worcester, MA 01609 USA.; Albrecht, DR (corresponding author), Worcester Polytech Inst, Dept Biol & Biotechnol, Worcester, MA 01609 USA.",dalbrecht@wpi.edu,"kamara, v/JVP-3229-2024","Kamara, Vanessa/0000-0003-3025-8099",National Science Foundation [1724026],National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)),We thank Fox Avery for testing these protocols and reviewing the manuscript and Eric Hall for programming assistance.

However, printed parts are typically plastic and often perform poorly compared to traditionally machined mechanisms. We have overcome many of the limitations of 3D printed mechanisms by exploiting the compliance of the plastic to produce a monolithic 3D printed flexure translation stage, capable of sub-micron-scale motion over a range of 8 x 8 x 4 mm. This requires minimal post-print clean-up and can be automated with readily available stepper motors. The resulting plastic composite structure is very stiff and exhibits remarkably low drift, moving less than 20 mu m over the course of a week, without temperature stabilisation. This enables us to construct a miniature microscope with excellent mechanical stability, perfect for time-lapse measurements in situ in an incubator or fume hood. The ease of manufacture lends itself to use in containment facilities where disposability is advantageous and to experiments requiring many microscopes in parallel. High performance mechanisms based on printed flexures need not be limited to microscopy, and we anticipate their use in other devices both within the laboratory and beyond.

MRI magnets can be constructed based on permanent neodymium-iron-boron (NdFeB) magnets in discretized arrangements, leading to substantially lower mass and costs. A challenge with these designs is, however, a good B-0 field homogeneity, which is needed to produce high quality images free of distortions. In this work, we describe an iterative approach to build a low-field MR magnet based on a B-0-shimming methodology using genetic algorithms. The methodology is tested by constructing a small bore (inner bore diameter = 130 mm) desktop MR magnet (<15 kg) at a field strength of B-0 = 0.1 T and a target volume of 4 cm in diameter. The configuration consists of a base magnet and shim inserts, which can be placed iteratively without modifying the base magnet assembly and without changing the inner dimensions of the bore or the outer dimensions of the MR magnet. Applying the shims, B0 field inhomogeneity could be reduced by a factor 8 from 5,448 to 682 ppm in the target central slice of the magnet. Further improvements of these results can be achieved in a second or third iteration, using more sensitive magnetic field probes (e.g., nuclear magnetic resonance based magnetic field measurements). The presented methodology is scalable to bigger magnet designs. The MR magnet can be reproduced with off-the-shelf components and a 3D printer and no special tools are needed for construction. All design files and code to reproduce the results will be made available as open source hardware.","[Wenzel, Konstantin; Alhamwey, Hazem; Riemann, Layla Tabea; Silemek, Berk; Winter, Lukas] Phys Tech Bundesanstalt PTB, Berlin, Germany; [Wenzel, Konstantin; Alhamwey, Hazem; Riemann, Layla Tabea; Silemek, Berk; Winter, Lukas] Phys Tech Bundesanstalt PTB, Braunschweig, Germany; [O'Reilly, Tom] Leiden Univ, Dept Radiol, CJ Gorter Ctr High Field MRI, Med Ctr, Leiden, Netherlands",Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt (PTB); Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt (PTB); Leiden University - Excl LUMC; Leiden University; Leiden University Medical Center (LUMC),"Winter, L (corresponding author), Phys Tech Bundesanstalt PTB, Berlin, Germany.; Winter, L (corresponding author), Phys Tech Bundesanstalt PTB, Braunschweig, Germany.",lukas.winter@ptb.de,"Silemek, Berk/Q-8425-2017","Silemek, Berk/0000-0001-8227-3632; Winter, Lukas/0000-0002-4381-275X",,,,,38,6,6,2,22,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,LAUSANNE,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",2296-424X,,,FRONT PHYS-LAUSANNE,Front.

Fluorescence measurement is typically achieved by utilizing a blue or red monochromatic excitation light source. However, algal photosynthetic pigments can differ in their absorption spectra, potentially leading to excitation wavelength dependent measurements of maximal and light acclimated PSII photosynthetic quantum yield (Fv/Fm or Fq'/Fm') and functional absorption cross section (sigma(PSII) or sigma(PSII)). Here we utilized an open source hardware development platform to construct a multispectral excitation fluorometer to assess spectrally dependent differences in photochemistry within four different Symbiodinium species (two of each ITS2-type A4 and B1). Multivariate analysis of light acclimated photochemical signatures showed separation between most alga types. These spectrally dependent differences in light acclimated PSII efficiency and PSII functional absorption cross section likely reflect changes in light harvesting compounds, their connectivity to the PSII reaction centers and the balance between photochemical and non-photochemical fluorescence quenching. Additionally, acclimation to low (20 iLmol photons M-2 s(-1)) and high (200 mu mol photons m(-2) s(-1)) light conditions was examined in two of these symbionts types (ITS-2 type A4 and B1) As expected, chlorophyll a cell(-1) decreased under high light acclimation in both symbionts. However, only A4 saw a subsequent reduction in absorbance whereas cellular volume decreased in the B1 (S. minutum) symbiont. In response to high light acclimation, Fv/Fm was significantly lower at all excitation wavelengths for the B1 symbiont where as efficiencies remained the same for A4. However, high-light acclimated Fq'/Fm' levels decreased in both symbionts, but only when measured using the 615 or 625 nm excitation wavelengths. Non-photochemical quenching within the antennae bed was downregulated under high light acclimation in the A4 symbiont, but only when measured using the 505 and 530 nm excitation wavelengths. Such changes in Fq'/Fm' and antennae bed quenching highlight the benefits of spectrally resolved photochemical measurements. Additionally, the utilization of Arduino and Bitscope hardware exemplifies the potential of open source development platforms for construction of highly customizable instrumentation for photosynthetic research.","[Hoadley, Kenneth D.; Warner, Mark E.] Univ Delaware, Sch Marine Sci & Policy, Lewes, DE 19958 USA; [Hoadley, Kenneth D.] Monterey Bay Aquarium Res Inst, Moss Landing, CA 95039 USA",University of Delaware; Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute,"Hoadley, KD (corresponding author), Univ Delaware, Sch Marine Sci & Policy, Lewes, DE 19958 USA.; Hoadley, KD (corresponding author), Monterey Bay Aquarium Res Inst, Moss Landing, CA 95039 USA.",khoadley@mbari.org,"Warner, Mark E/J-6241-2013","Warner, Mark/0000-0003-1015-9413; Hoadley, Kenneth/0000-0002-9287-181X","National Science Foundation [1316055, 1258065]; Division Of Integrative Organismal Systems; Direct For Biological Sciences [1258065] Funding Source: National Science Foundation; Emerging Frontiers; Direct For Biological Sciences [1316055] Funding Source: National Science Foundation",National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Division Of Integrative Organismal Systems; Direct For Biological Sciences(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Biological Sciences (BIO)NSF - Division of Integrative Organismal Systems (IOS)); Emerging Frontiers; Direct For Biological Sciences(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Biological Sciences (BIO)),This project was supported by funding from the National Science Foundation (awards 1316055 and 1258065 to MW).,,44,14,14,3,10,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,LAUSANNE,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",,2296-7745,,FRONT MAR SCI,Front.

Although methods and protocols for tissue decellularization are abundant throughout the literature, they can be time intensive and typically require specific overhead in terms of equipment. To reduce these barriers to entry, a functional and reproducible prototype of a tissue infusion/perfusion device (TIPD) has been designed and fabricated using three-dimensional printed parts in conjunction with commercially available components. This TIPD forms a system composed of two peristaltic pumps, two 3-way valves, and a chamber in which tissue is contained, and is controlled by user-customizable software. To increase repeatability among decellularization protocols, an automation function has been integrated into the software, which is able to specify fluid flow rates and define specific valve locations enabling selection of solutions to be introduced into a scaffold over the course of a decellularization process. The prototype has been tested for proof of concept through infusion and perfusion decellularization of skeletal muscle and intact kidneys, respectively, and has shown successful removal of cellular content while maintaining an intact ultrastructure. In an effort to increase the reproducibility of experimental designs and to promote an open source hardware initiative in the field of tissue engineering, a novel device was conceptualized and prototyped with printable part files made available for its fabrication in tandem with instructions for assembly. Impact Statement Repeatable methods for decellularization are essential for achieving consistent substrates between batches, laboratories, and facilities. To meet this end, an automatable tissue infusion/perfusion device composed of three-dimensional printed parts and commercially available components has been prototyped and tested. Materials and instructions for its assembly have been made available in an effort to reduce variability among equipment as well as to provide a platform on which to iterate open-source hardware in tissue engineering.","[Schilling, Benjamin K.; Snowden, Malik J.; Baker, Jocelyn S.; Byrd, Kristen; Marra, Kacey G.] Univ Pittsburgh, Dept Bioengn, Pittsburgh, PA USA; [Lamberti, Kimberly K.; Komatsu, Chiaki; Solari, Mario G.; Marra, Kacey G.] Univ Pittsburgh, Dept Plast Surg, 203 Lothrop St Biomed Sci Tower E1655, Pittsburgh, PA 15213 USA; [Marra, Kacey G.] McGowan Inst Regenerat Med, Pittsburgh, PA USA",Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); University of Pittsburgh; Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); University of Pittsburgh,"Marra, KG (corresponding author), Univ Pittsburgh, Dept Plast Surg, 203 Lothrop St Biomed Sci Tower E1655, Pittsburgh, PA 15213 USA.",marrak@upmc.edu,,"Baker, Jocelyn/0000-0001-7858-0752; Lamberti, Kimberly/0000-0001-7182-3440",,,,,40,10,11,1,9,"MARY ANN LIEBERT, INC",NEW ROCHELLE,"140 HUGUENOT STREET, 3RD FL, NEW ROCHELLE, NY 10801 USA",1937-3341,1937-335X,,TISSUE ENG PT A,Tissue Eng.

Aquatic environmental DNA (eDNA) has emerged as a promising approach to identify organisms in freshwater and marine environments. While the recovery of eDNA from water most commonly involves capture of biological debris on a filter matrix, practitioners are yet to converge on standardized approaches for filtration, particularly in the field. This lack of standardization has resulted in inconsistent handling of samples following collection, limiting interpretation of results across studies and burdening groups with inconvenient storage and transport logistics that may compromise eDNA integrity.Methods. A simple to assemble and low-cost ($350 USD) water filtration system is demonstrated that can be used in field and laboratory settings to reduce time between sample acquisition and eDNA filtration, maximizing eDNA sample recovery. Quantitative PCR is used to show the utility of the platform for laboratory and marine eDNA analysis.Results. The resulting eDNA collection system is easily transported in a rugged water-resistant case, operates for more than eight hours on a 12-volt lead-acid battery, and has an unobstructed filtration rate of 150.05 & PLUSMN; 7.01 mL/min and 151.70 & PLUSMN; 6.72 mL/min with 0.22 & mu;m and 0.45 & mu;m Sterivex filters, respectively. We show that immediate sample filtration increases eDNA recovery in the laboratory, and demonstrate collections in aquaria and marine environments. We anticipate that providing easy to obtain, open hardware designs for eDNA sample collection will increase standardization of aquatic eDNA collection methods and improve cross-study comparisons.","[DeHart, Hayley M.] Johns Hopkins Univ, Res & Exploratory Dev Dept, Laurel, MD USA; [Gasser, Mark T.; Thielen, Peter] Johns Hopkins Univ, Res & Exploratory Dev Dept, Appl Phys Lab, Laurel, MD 20723 USA; [Dixon, Jarret] Johns Hopkins Univ, Force Project Sect, Appl Phys Lab, Laurel, MD USA",Johns Hopkins University; Johns Hopkins University; Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory; Johns Hopkins University; Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory,"Thielen, P (corresponding author), Johns Hopkins Univ, Res & Exploratory Dev Dept, Appl Phys Lab, Laurel, MD 20723 USA.",ter.thielen@jhuapl.edu,"Gasser, Mark T/KLC-5289-2024","Gasser, Mark T/0000-0002-9396-4954",JHU/APL Internal Research and Development; Department of Navy [N00014-21-1-2610],JHU/APL Internal Research and Development; Department of Navy,"This study was funded by JHU/APL Internal Research and Development and the Department of Navy award N00014-21-1-2610 issued by the Office of Naval Research.

The battery system is the most expensive part in the majority of the e-mobility devices. Therefore, battery manufacturers tend to reduce the battery cost by using simple battery management systems that provide only basic safety features. Possible advanced functionalities are not implemented and the battery may lose performanceduring its use. Widely spread maintenance centers are thus required to support the mobility electrification process, but their diffusion is limited by the high cost ofprofessional battery characterization instruments. This work proposes an open-hardware low-cost battery maintenance tool architecture that can be used with common laboratory instruments. The tool is based on a relay-matrix and a battery monitor integrated circuit. It is able to completely characterize and optimize the state of a battery independently of the battery management system and also gives a figure of the individual aging of the battery cells. The work shows the architecture and the experimental validation of a 16-cells battery maintenance tool prototype. The results demonstrate that utilizing the tool brings the battery in the best possible state and identifies the degradation of the cells in terms of capacity and resistance.","[Carloni, Andrea; Baronti, Federico; Di Rienzo, Roberto; Roncella, Roberto; Saletti, Roberto] Univ Pisa, Dipartimento Ingn Informaz, Via Caruso 16, I-56122 Pisa, Italy",University of Pisa,"Saletti, R (corresponding author), Univ Pisa, Dipartimento Ingn Informaz, Via Caruso 16, I-56122 Pisa, Italy.",andrea.carloni@ing.unipi.it; federico.baronti@unipi.it; roberto.dirienzo@unipi.it; roberto.roncella@unipi.it; roberto.saletti@unipi.it,,"Saletti, Roberto/0000-0001-9594-3535; Roncella, Roberto/0000-0003-4087-9761; DI RIENZO, ROBERTO/0000-0002-4238-5864; Carloni, Andrea/0000-0003-0554-5299","PAR FAS Toscana 2007-2013 (Bando FAR FAS 2014) [4421.02102014.072000022]; ENEA ""Ricerca di Sistema Elettrico-Electrochemical Storage Systems and relevant network interfaces""; CrossLab project by MIUR ""Departments of Excellence"" program","PAR FAS Toscana 2007-2013 (Bando FAR FAS 2014); ENEA ""Ricerca di Sistema Elettrico-Electrochemical Storage Systems and relevant network interfaces""; CrossLab project by MIUR ""Departments of Excellence"" program","This research was partially funded by PAR FAS Toscana 2007-2013 (Bando FAR FAS 2014), under agreement n. 4421.02102014.072000022 Project SUMA, by ENEA ""Ricerca di Sistema Elettrico-Electrochemical Storage Systems and relevant network interfaces"", and supported by the CrossLab project funded by MIUR ""Departments of Excellence"" program.",,27,6,6,7,13,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,1996-1073,,ENERGIES,Energies,AUG,2021,14,16,,,,,,,4962,10.3390/en14164962,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/en14164962,,,10,Energy & Fuels,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Energy & Fuels,UG5JQ,,gold,,,8/15/24,WOS:000689288900001,,0,449,,,

This article describes the invention of a new testing system: the parametric open source cold-frame agrivoltaic system (POSCAS). POSCAS is an adapted gardening cold-frame used in cold climates as it acts as a small greenhouse for agricultural production. POSCAS is designed to test partially transparent solar photovoltaic (PV) modules targeting the agrivoltaic market. It can both function as a traditional cold frame, but it can also be automated to function as a full-service greenhouse. The integrated PV module roof can be used to power the controls or it can be attached to a microinverter to produce power. POSCAS can be placed in an experimental array for testing agricultural and power production. It can be easily adapted for any type of partially transparent PV module. An array of POSCAS systems allows for the testing of agrivoltaic impacts from the percent transparency of the modules by varying the thickness of a thin film PV material or the density of silicon-based cells, and various forms of optical enhancement, anti-reflection coatings and solar light spectral shifting materials in the back sheet. All agrivoltaic variables can be customized to identify ideal PV designs for a given agricultural crop.","[Pearce, Joshua M.] Western Univ, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, London, ON N6A 5B9, Canada; [Pearce, Joshua M.] Western Univ, Ivey Business Sch, London, ON N6G 0N1, Canada",Western University (University of Western Ontario); Western University (University of Western Ontario),"Pearce, JM (corresponding author), Western Univ, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, London, ON N6A 5B9, Canada.; Pearce, JM (corresponding author), Western Univ, Ivey Business Sch, London, ON N6G 0N1, Canada.",joshua.pearce@uwo.ca,"Pearce, Joshua/C-9240-2013","Pearce, Joshua/0000-0001-9802-3056",,,,,147,8,8,0,18,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2411-5134,,INVENTIONS-BASEL,Inventions,DEC,2021,6,4,,,,,,,71,10.3390/inventions6040071,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/inventions6040071,,,20,"Engineering, Multidisciplinary",Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI),Engineering,XZ3PT,,gold,,,8/15/24,WOS:000737568200001,,0,450,,,

Distributed in space and combined with a conventional video camera, they allow to practically sense sound power over a very large area without hassle. We give a comprehensive overview of the proposed system and its potential applications. We describe the hardware design and trade-offs made. We provide a model for the channel between sound power measurements and signal acquired by the video camera. Because each sensor is potentially affected by a different attenuation due to the channel, we propose a calibration procedure to restore the scale of the measurements. The effectiveness of the calibration is validated in an experiment.

The total construction cost for this rover is less than USD 3000, approximately one-tenth the cost of existing platforms, and it can be built using facilities frequently available at academic institutions (machine shop, 3-D printer, open-source hardware and software). Instrumentation deployed on this rover can be customized; the rover presented in this study was equipped with a dual-frequency GPS receiver and a digital SLR camera for constructing digital elevation models using structure-from-motion (SfM) photogrammetry. We deployed this prototype rover on the Northeast Greenland Ice Stream to map local variations in snow accumulation and surface topography. The rover conducted four autonomous missions based out of the East Greenland Ice-Core Project (EastGRIP) camp during July 2017, measuring surface elevation transects across the hazardous ice-stream shear margins. During these missions, the rover proved capable of driving over 20 km on a single charge with a drawbar pull of 250 N, sufficient to tow instrumentation of up to 100 kg. The rover also acquired photographs that were subsequently used to construct digital elevation models of a site monitored for spatiotemporal variability in snow accumulation, demonstrating adequate stability for high-resolution imaging applications. Due to its low cost, low-power requirements, and simple modular design, mass deployments of this rover design are practicable. Operation of the rover in hazardous areas circumvents the substantial expense and risk to personnel associated with conventional, crewed deployments. Thus, this rover is an investigatory plat-form that enables direct exploration of polar environments considered too hazardous for conventional field expeditions.","[Hoffman, Andrew O.; Hvidberg, Christine] Univ Copenhagen, Ctr Ice & Climate, Niels Bohr Inst, Juliane Maries Vej 30, DK-2100 Copenhagen, Denmark; [Steen-Larsen, Hans Christian] Univ Bergen, Geophys Inst, Bergen, Norway; [Steen-Larsen, Hans Christian] Bjerknes Ctr Climate Res, Bergen, Norway; [Hoffman, Andrew O.; Christianson, Knut] Univ Washington, Dept Earth & Space Sci, Seattle, WA 98195 USA",University of Copenhagen; Niels Bohr Institute; University of Bergen; Bjerknes Centre for Climate Research; University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle,"Hoffman, AO (corresponding author), Univ Copenhagen, Ctr Ice & Climate, Niels Bohr Inst, Juliane Maries Vej 30, DK-2100 Copenhagen, Denmark.; Hoffman, AO (corresponding author), Univ Washington, Dept Earth & Space Sci, Seattle, WA 98195 USA.",hoffmaao@uw.edu,"Steen-Larsen, Hans Christian/F-9927-2013; Hvidberg, Christine S./E-8934-2015","Hvidberg, Christine S./0000-0002-9665-1339","VILLUM FONDEN [2361, 16572]; Denmark (A.

However, there is currently a lack of instrumentation to monitor such experiments in real time, necessitating repeated transfers of the samples to stand-alone analytical instruments, thus limiting the types of experiments that could be performed. Here we address this gap with the development of the optoPlateReader (oPR), an open-source, solid-state, compact device that allows automated optogenetic stimulation and spectroscopy in each well of a 96-well plate. The oPR integrates an optoPlate illumination module with a module called the optoReader, an array of 96 photodiodes and LEDs that allows 96 parallel light measurements. The oPR was optimized for stimulation with blue light and for measurements of optical density and fluorescence. After calibration of all device components, we used the oPR to measure growth and to induce and measure fluorescent protein expression in E. coli. We further demonstrated how the optical read/write capabilities of the oPR permit computer-in-the-loop feedback control, where the current state of the sample can be used to adjust the optical stimulation parameters of the sample according to pre-defined feedback algorithms. The oPR will thus help realize an untapped potential for optogenetic experiments by enabling automated reading, writing, and feedback in microwell plates through open-source hardware that is accessible, customizable, and inexpensive. An open source, 96-well plate reader allows simultaneous optogenetic stimulation and absorbance/fluorescence measurements in each well.","[Benman, William; Datta, Saachi; Gonzalez-Martinez, David; Lee, Gloria; Hooper, Juliette; Qian, Grace; Leavitt, Gabrielle; Salloum, Lana; Ho, Gabrielle; Mhatre, Sharvari; Magaraci, Michael S.; Patterson, Michael; Mannickarottu, Sevile G.; Chow, Brian Y.; Bugaj, Lukasz J.] Univ Penn, Dept Bioengn, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Malani, Saurabh; Avalos, Jose L.] Princeton Univ, Dept Chem & Biol Engn, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA; [Avalos, Jose L.] Andlinger Ctr Energy & Environm, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA; [Avalos, Jose L.] High Meadows Environm Inst, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA; [Bugaj, Lukasz J.] Univ Penn, Abramson Canc Ctr, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Bugaj, Lukasz J.] Univ Penn, Inst Regenerat Med, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA",University of Pennsylvania; Princeton University; University of Pennsylvania; University of Pennsylvania,"Bugaj, LJ (corresponding author), Univ Penn, Dept Bioengn, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA.; Bugaj, LJ (corresponding author), Univ Penn, Abramson Canc Ctr, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA.; Bugaj, LJ (corresponding author), Univ Penn, Inst Regenerat Med, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA.",bugaj@seas.upenn.edu,,"Leavitt, Gabrielle/0000-0002-3138-6271","Foundation for the National Institutes of Health (Foundation for the National Institutes of Health, Inc.); Bradley Gabel Memorial Fund [R35GM138211, R01NS101106]; National Institutes of Health [CAREER CBET 2145699, MCB 1652003, CAREER CBET 1751840]; National Science Foundation [DE-SC0019363, DE-SC0022155]; U.S. Department of Energy (Office of Science, Office of Biological and Environmental Research, Genomic Science Program); Singapore's STAR Fellowship; U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) [DE-SC0022155] Funding Source: U.S. Department of Energy (DOE)","Foundation for the National Institutes of Health (Foundation for the National Institutes of Health, Inc.)(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA); Bradley Gabel Memorial Fund; National Institutes of Health(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA); National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); U.S. Department of Energy (Office of Science, Office of Biological and Environmental Research, Genomic Science Program)(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); Singapore's STAR Fellowship; U.S. Department of Energy (DOE)(United States Department of Energy (DOE))","We thank the George H.

The availability of reduced-pressure ion mobility systems remains limited due to comparatively expensive commercial options and limited shared design features in the open literature. This report details the complete design and benchmarking characteristics of a reduced-pressure ion mobility system. The system is constructed from FR4 PCB electrodes and encased in a PTFE vacuum enclosure with custom torque-tightened couplers to utilize standard KF40 bulkheads. The PTFE enclosure directly minimizes the overall system expenses, and the implementation of threaded brass inserts allows for facile attachments to the vacuum enclosure without damaging the thermoplastic housing. Front and rear ion funnels maximize ion transmission and help mitigate the effects of radial ion diffusion. A custom planar ion shuttle transports ions from the exit of the rear ion funnel into the ion optics of an ion trap mass analyzer. The planar ion shuttle can couple the IM system to any contemporary Thermo Scientific ion trap mass analyzer. Signal stability and ion intensity remain unchanging following the implementation of the planar ion shuttle when compared to the original stacked ring ion guide. The constructed IM system showed resolving powers up to 85 for various small molecules and proteins using the Fourier transform from a similar to 1 m drift tube. Recorded mobilities derived from first principles agree with published literature results with an average error of 1.1% and an average error toward literature values using single field calibration of <1.3%.","[Buzitis, Nathan W.; Clowers, Brian H.] Washington State Univ, Dept Chem, Pullman, WA 99164 USA",Washington State University,"Clowers, BH (corresponding author), Washington State Univ, Dept Chem, Pullman, WA 99164 USA.",brian.clowers@wsu.edu,,"Buzitis, Nathan/0009-0009-3510-2887",National Institute of General Medical Sciences [R01GM138863]; NIH,National Institute of General Medical Sciences(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS)); NIH(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA),Support for this effort was supplied by the NIH (NIGMS Grant R01GM138863),,62,0,0,4,4,AMER CHEMICAL SOC,WASHINGTON,"1155 16TH ST, NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA",1044-0305,1879-1123,,J AM SOC MASS SPECTR,J.

To this end, measuring, data acquisition, and storage, as well as remote online visualization of real-time information, must be performed using suitable equipment. An experimental SMG is being deployed that combines photovoltaics and the energy carrier hydrogen through the interconnection of photovoltaic panels, electrolyser, fuel cell, and load around a voltage bus powered by a lithium battery. This paper presents a monitoring system based on open-source hardware and software for tracking the temperature of the photovoltaic generator in such an SMG. In fact, the increases in temperature in PV modules lead to a decrease in their efficiency, so this parameter needs to be measured in order to monitor and evaluate the operation. Specifically, the developed monitoring system consists of a network of digital temperature sensors connected to an Arduino microcontroller, which feeds the acquired data to a Raspberry Pi microcomputer. The latter is accessed by a cloud-enabled user/operator interface implemented in Grafana. The monitoring system is expounded and experimental results are reported to validate the proposal.","[Maria Portalo, Jose; Gonzalez, Isaias; Jose Calderon, Antonio] Univ Extremadura, Dept Elect Engn Elect & Automat, Ave Elvas S-N, Badajoz 06006, Spain",Universidad de Extremadura,"Gonz√°lez, I (corresponding author), Univ Extremadura, Dept Elect Engn Elect & Automat, Ave Elvas S-N, Badajoz 06006, Spain.",jportalo@alumnos.unex.es; igonzp@unex.es; ajcalde@unex.es,"Gonz√°lez, Isa√≠as/Y-7300-2018; Calderon Godoy, Antonio Jose/R-4094-2019","Gonz√°lez, Isa√≠as/0000-0001-5645-3832; Calderon Godoy, Antonio Jose/0000-0003-2094-209X",European Regional Development Funds FEDER; Junta de Extremadura [IB18041],European Regional Development Funds FEDER(European Union (EU)); Junta de Extremadura,Project co-financed by European Regional Development Funds FEDER and by the Junta de Extremadura (IB18041).,,46,24,24,2,4,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2071-1050,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,AUG,2021,13,15,,,,,,,8182,10.3390/su13158182,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su13158182,,,23,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,TW4AH,,gold,,,8/15/24,WOS:000682344600001,,0,456,,,

An anomaly in the biomedical context has an obvious diagnostic implication. The first step in this time-series-to-network (T2N) approach is to partition the signal intensity in q user-defined intervals where, qMUCH LESS-THANN, N being the number of discrete sampling points of the time series. This maps the time series into a multigraph GM, the state transition between different signal partitions serving as directed edges E of the graph GM(V,E), q being the cardinality of the vertex set V. Eventually, GM may have self-loops. Next, GM is split into a simple graph G = G(V,H),with edge-set H devoid of self-loops and three sets of parameters, namely, node strength index (NSI), interaction strength ratio (AISR), self-loop weights. The order of computational tasks reduces from O(N) to O(3q) with qMUCH LESS-THANN. Using such decomposition, we have performed beat classification of ECG data collected from MIT BIH repository. The network derived feature sets enables us to drastically compress the training set size. We next show how a simple neural MLP model with a single hidden layer with similar to 100 neurons is able to learn to classify normal and abnormal single beats with good precision and recall scores. The results showcase the possibility of performing anomaly detection in bio-signals with an algorithm exhibiting low computational complexity, showing the promise of implementation on low cost IoT hardware devices integrated with modern digital data acquisition systems for bedside patient monitoring.","[Mandyam, Sridhar K.] Int Inst Informat Technol Bengaluru, Ctr Appl Data Sci, Bengaluru 560100, Karnataka, India; [Dasgupta, Anjan Kr] Univ Calcutta, Dept Biochem, 35 Ballygunge Circular Rd, Kolkata 700019, India; [Sridhar, Usha] Ecometrix Res, Bengaluru 560078, India; [Dasgupta, Panini] Univ Calcutta, Dept Atmospher Sci, Kolkata, W Bengal, India; [Chakrabarti, Amlan] Calcutta Univ, AK Choudhury Sch IT, Technol Campus,JD 2,Sect 3, Kolkata 700098, India; [Dasgupta, Panini] Indian Inst Trop Meteorol, Pashan Rd, Pune 411008, Maharashtra, India",International Institute of Information Technology Bangalore (IIIT Bangalore); University of Calcutta; University of Calcutta; University of Calcutta; Ministry of Earth Sciences (MoES) - India; Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology (IITM),"Dasgupta, AK (corresponding author), Univ Calcutta, Dept Biochem, 35 Ballygunge Circular Rd, Kolkata 700019, India.",sridhar.mandyamk@iiith.ac.in; adbioc@caluniv.ac.in; usha.sridhar@ecometrix.in; panini.dasgupta@tropmet.res.in; acakcs@caluniv.ac.in,"Chakrabarti, Amlan/U-7020-2019; Dasgupta., Panini/GYJ-5093-2022","Chakrabarti, Amlan/0000-0003-4380-3172;",MeitY [13(10)/2016-ccBT 18/7/17],MeitY,"The authors thank MeitY Sanction No. 13(10)/2016-cc&BT & 18/7/17 for the project entitled ""Open Hardware Based Communicable Digital Bio-Sensing Platform.""",,31,0,0,0,8,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",1746-8094,1746-8108,,BIOMED SIGNAL PROCES,Biomed.

This ""Do-It-Yourself"" interface comprised a 1.0 mx0.25 mm segment of MTX-5 metallic column and a low-cost DC power supply. Thermal desorption modulation (TDM) was attained using a dual-stage heater-based modulator in a novel segmented-loop configuration. TDM was achieved by alternating analyte trapping and thermal desorption. Former process relied on analyte partition to sorbent phase, while latter explored direct resistive heating. Introduction of an intermediate delay segment between the two stages mitigated analyte breakthrough, improving peak symmetry and chromatographic efficiency. This feature was critical to acquire reliable GCxGC modulation using such simple heater-based device. The effects of important modulation variables on 2D separations were investigated, including TDM stage length, dimension of delay loop, and outlet pressure. Significant advances and limitations of proposed TDM strategy were carefully determined. Proposed GCxGC prototype by using an in-oven TDM modulator was successfully applied to a series of challenging matrices, including petroleum distillates, biodiesel, and essential oil. This open-hardware, cost-effective modulator was easy to install and operate, as it circumvented the need for sophisticated components (e.g. moving parts and cooling systems). Therefore, our modulator is a compelling alternative to existing GCxGC solutions to operate in resource-limited laboratories.","[Mucedola, Vanessa; Vieira, Luis C.

This amplification is connected with the resonant frequency, which can be estimated applying the horizontal-to-vertical spectral ratio (1-1/V) method on seismic noise measurements. In this work, a low-cost user-friendly data acquisition system (Geophonino-3D) has been designed for three-component seismic noise recording. The developed system consists of the signal conditioning circuit and the Arduino Due with an SD Shield for data storage. The suitability of the equipment for the application of the H/V method has been first assessed in the laboratory, according to the experimental sensitivity, the internal noise stability and the channel consistency. Subsequently, experimental verification has been carried out by recording seismic noise at eight different sites along the province of Alicante (southeast Spain), with different soil characteristics. The performance of the developed acquisition system has been evaluated in terms of the power spectral density and the H/V peaks by comparison with the results obtained through a commercial seismic recorder. The obtained results show the applicability of the developed acquisition system to record seismic noise and to apply the H/V method. Geophonino-3D is an open source and open hardware system and the price of its components is much lower than any other commercial equipment, which becomes a significant advance especially for small research groups with reduced economic support.

Our method relies on training a physics-based machine learning model using cells with identical fluorescent labels imaged in situ. We use this technique for in vivo imaging of immune responses in mouse lymph nodes following vaccination.

However, applying such stimuli simultaneously is difficult in practice. We aimed to design, build, test, and open-source describe a simple device that subjects a conventional mouse cage to independent cycles of physiologically relevant environmental variables. The device is based on a box enclosing the rodent cage to modify the light, feeding, and temperature environments. The device provides temperature-controlled air conditioning (heating or cooling) by a Peltier module and includes programmable feeding and illumination. All functions are set by a user-friendly front panel for independent cycle programming. Bench testing with a model simulating the CO2 production of mice in the cage showed: a) suitable air renewal (by measuring actual ambient CO2), b) controlled realistic illumination at the mouse enclosure (measured by a photometer), c) stable temperature control, and d) correct cycling of light, feeding, and temperature. The cost of all the supplies (retail purchased by e-commerce) was <300 US$. Detailed technical information is open-source provided, allowing for any user to reliably reproduce or modify the device. This approach can considerably facilitate circadian research since using one of the described low-cost devices for any mouse group with a given light-food-temperature paradigm allows for all the experiments to be performed simultaneously, thereby requiring no changes in the light/temperature of a general-use laboratory. 1 Introduction","[Farre, Ramon; Rodriguez-Lazaro, Miguel A.; Otero, Jorge; Gavara, Nuria; Sunyer, Raimon; Almendros, Isaac] Univ Barcelona, Sch Med & Hlth Sci, Unit Biophys & Bioengn, Barcelona, Spain; [Farre, Ramon; Otero, Jorge; Almendros, Isaac] Ciber Enfermedades Resp CIBERES, Barcelona, Spain; [Farre, Ramon; Almendros, Isaac] Inst Invest Biomed August Pi Sunyer IDIBAPS, Barcelona, Spain; [Otero, Jorge; Gavara, Nuria] Barcelona Inst Sci & Technol BIST, Inst Bioengn Catalonia IBEC, Barcelona, Spain; [Sunyer, Raimon] CIBER Bioingn Biomat & Nanomed CIBER BBN, Barcelona, Spain; [Farre, Nuria] Saolta Univ Healthcare Grp, Discipline Cardiol, Galway, Ireland; [Farre, Nuria] Univ Galway, Sch Med, Galway, Ireland; [Gozal, David] Marshall Univ, Joan C Edwards Sch Med, Off Dean, Huntington, WV USA",University of Barcelona; CIBER - Centro de Investigacion Biomedica en Red; CIBERES; University of Barcelona; Hospital Clinic de Barcelona; IDIBAPS; Barcelona Institute of Science & Technology; Institut de Bioenginyeria de Catalunya; University of Barcelona; CIBER - Centro de Investigacion Biomedica en Red; CIBERBBN; Ollscoil na Gaillimhe-University of Galway; Marshall University,"Farr√©, R (corresponding author), Univ Barcelona, Sch Med & Hlth Sci, Unit Biophys & Bioengn, Barcelona, Spain.; Farr√©, R (corresponding author), Ciber Enfermedades Resp CIBERES, Barcelona, Spain.; Farr√©, R (corresponding author), Inst Invest Biomed August Pi Sunyer IDIBAPS, Barcelona, Spain.",rfarre@ub.edu,,,,,,,34,0,0,0,0,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,LAUSANNE,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",,1664-042X,,FRONT PHYSIOL,Front.

Between crops, weeds are typically controlled by applying herbicides or tillage to the entire field. However, these control methods are expensive and can pose environmental risks. Robotic weeding systems are a good solution to minimize environmental impact and save money on herbicides, but they are expensive (>$100,000). The Weed Warden is a low-cost (<$200) plant detection sensor that can be mounted on rovers or tractors. The Weed Warden uses an open source multispectral sensor to detect live vegetation and sends a logic signal that could trigger a weed removal system such as a sprayer or mechanical tillage when vegetation is detected. We evaluate the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Enhanced Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (ENDVI), and Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI), for producing a value that, combined with a calibrated threshold, will indicate if there is plant life under the sensor. The Weed Warden system using ENDVI is most consistent at detection, with the ability to discriminate 7.6x7.6 cm vegetation samples from bare soil at sensor heights of 30 and 41 cm from the ground. The Weed Warden is a proof-of-concept component of an alternative system to robotic weeders of fallow fields that could help reduce costs, improve environmental outcomes in agricultural settings, and advance research into fallow field management practices.(c) 2022 The Authors.

However, multi-color or hyperspectral SMLM can pose particular challenges which affect image quality and data interpretation, such as unequal photophysical performance of fluorophores and non-linear image registration issues, which arise as two emission channels travel along different optical paths to reach the detector. In addition, using evanescent-wave based approaches (Total Internal Reflection Fluorescence: TIRF) where beam shape, decay depth, and power density are important, different illumination wavelengths can lead to unequal imaging depth across multiple channels on the same sample. A potential useful approach would be to use a single excitation wavelength to perform hyperspectral localization imaging. We report herein on the use of a variable angle tunable thin-film filter to spectrally isolate far-red emitting fluorophores. This solution was integrated into a commercial microscope platform using an open-source hardware design, enabling the rapid acquisition of SMLM images arising from fluorescence emission captured within similar to 15 nm to 20 nm spectral windows (or detection bands). By characterizing intensity distributions, average intensities, and localization frequency through a range of spectral windows, we investigated several far-red emitting fluorophores and identified an optimal fluorophore pair for two-color SMLM using this method. Fluorophore crosstalk between the different spectral windows was assessed by examining the effect of varying the photon output thresholds on the localization frequency and fraction of data recovered. The utility of this approach was demonstrated by hyper-spectral super-resolution imaging of the interaction between the mitochondrial protein, TOM20, and the peroxisomal protein, PMP70.","[Vissa, Adriano; Kim, Peter K.; Yip, Christopher M.] Univ Toronto, Dept Biochem, Toronto, ON M5S 1A8, Canada; [Vissa, Adriano; Giuliani, Maximiliano; Yip, Christopher M.] Univ Toronto, Inst Biomat & Biomed Engn, Toronto, ON M5S 3G9, Canada; [Vissa, Adriano; Kim, Peter K.] Hosp Sick Children, Program Cell Biol, Toronto, ON M5G 0A4, Canada; [Yip, Christopher M.] Univ Toronto, Dept Chem Engn & Appl Chem, Toronto, ON M5S 1A4, Canada",University of Toronto; University of Toronto; University of Toronto; Hospital for Sick Children (SickKids); University of Toronto,"Yip, CM (corresponding author), Univ Toronto, Dept Biochem, Toronto, ON M5S 1A8, Canada.; Yip, CM (corresponding author), Univ Toronto, Inst Biomat & Biomed Engn, Toronto, ON M5S 3G9, Canada.; Yip, CM (corresponding author), Univ Toronto, Dept Chem Engn & Appl Chem, Toronto, ON M5S 1A4, Canada.",christopher.yip@utoronto.ca,,,Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada Discovery [RGPIN-2015-043],Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada Discovery(Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)),"This work was funded by the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada Discovery, Grant No. RGPIN-2015-043.",,28,2,3,1,12,AMER INST PHYSICS,MELVILLE,"1305 WALT WHITMAN RD, STE 300, MELVILLE, NY 11747-4501 USA",0034-6748,1089-7623,,REV SCI INSTRUM,Rev.

Although specifically designed for active textiles, the characterization device is broadly applicable for studying the performance of actuators including but not limited to Shape Memory Alloy (SMA) wires, SMA springs, and electroactive polymers. The characterization device may be operated in several modes that enable a wide variety of experimental protocols to be automated. These modes include but are not limited to automatic displacement and displacement rate mode, automatic force mode, and manual displacement mode. For active textiles that actuate by electrical stimulus or by resistive heating, the electronic system has five independent motor drivers. For each driver, the voltage drop across its outputs and current are measured, enabling the measurement of textile power consumption and other electrical properties. The validation of the Active Textile Characterization Device uses a contractile SMA knitted textile actuated by four motor drivers through resistive heating. Several protocols were successfully conducted to demonstrate the experimental flexibility of the system. During these experiments, knit length, knit tension, current through the knit, voltage drop across the knit, and room temperature were measured with respect to time. (C) 2019 The Authors.

In a 4-week experiment, wild Setaria viridis and domesticated Setaria italica had fundamentally different temporal responses to water availability. While both lines produced similar levels of biomass under limited water conditions, Setaria viridis maintained the same water-use efficiency under water replete conditions, while Setaria italica shifted to less efficient growth. Overall, the Bellwether Phenotyping Platform and PlantCV software detected significant effects of genotype and environment on height, biomass, water-use efficiency, color, plant architecture, and tissue water status traits.

High-resolution anatomical and functional studies of the brain require artifact-free images that are acquired with a highly sensitive radiofrequency (RF) coil. New Method: The animal holder plays an important role in mitigating image artifacts: motion artifacts are reduced by immobilizing the animal and geometric-distortion artifacts are reduced by accurately positioning the animal to improve static-field shimming. The RF coil, in turn, must provide high sensitivity over the whole brain and not physically interfere with the animal holder. To accomplish these tasks, the animal holder and RF coil should be designed in tandem. In this manuscript, animal holders and RF coils for mice, rats, and marmoset monkeys are described. Each animal holder includes components for anesthesia delivery and animal immobilization, as well as a compatible receive coil. Results/Comparison with Existing Method(s): Animal holders were capable of accurate and reproducible positioning (for the marmoset, this was in the stereotactic plane), consequently reducing geometric distortion in echo-planar images. Ear bars were designed in conjunction with receive-coil formers, thereby maximizing the sensitive region of coils, while concurrently reducing motion to less than a pixel over EPI time series. Motion and SNR were quantified to facilitate direct comparison to existing animal holders and RF coils. All computer-aided-design (CAD) files of animal holders and RF coils are provided to promote dissemination. Conclusions: The confluence of design between the animal holder and RF coil provides a pragmatic solution for routine imaging of small animals.","[Gilbert, Kyle M.; Schaeffer, David J.; Gati, Joseph S.; Klassen, L.

EIS results from the developed potentiostat were validated with a commercial benchtop potentiostat by comparing impedance magnitude and phase values along the EIS frequency range. In addition, an experimental design was performed for detecting S100B in spiked human plasma samples with S100B concentrations of clinical utility, and a calibration curve was found for quantifying S100B detection. No statistically significant differences were found between EIS results from the developed potentiostat and the commercial potentiostat. Statistically significant differences in the changes in charge transfer resistance signal between each tested S100B concentration (p < 0.05) were found, with a limit of detection of 35.73 pg/mL. The modularity of the proposed potentiostat allows easier component changes according to the application demands in power, frequency excitation ranges, wireless communication protocol, signal amplification and transduction, precision, and sampling frequency of ADC, among others, when compared to state-of-the-art opensource EIS potentiostats. In addition, the use of minimal, easy acquirable open-source hardware and software, high-level filtering, accurate ADC, Fast Fourier Transform with low spectral leakage, wireless communication, and the simple user interface provides a framework for facilitating EIS analysis and developing new affordable instrumentation for POC biosensors integrated systems.","[Burgos-Florez, Francisco; Rodriguez, Alexander; Cervera, Eliana; Villalba, Pedro J.] Univ Norte, Dept Med, Biotechnol Res Grp, Barranquilla, Colombia; [Burgos-Florez, Francisco; Sanjuan, Marco] Univ Norte, Dept Mech Engn, Rat Use Energy & Preservat Environm Grp UREMA, Barranquilla, Colombia; [Zucolotto, Valtencir] Univ Sao Paulo, Sao Carlos Inst Phys, GNano Nanomed & Nanotoxicol Grp, Sao Carlos, SP, Brazil",Universidad del Norte Colombia; Universidad del Norte Colombia; Universidade de Sao Paulo,"Villalba, PJ (corresponding author), Univ Norte, Dept Med, Biotechnol Res Grp, Barranquilla, Colombia.",villalbap@uninorte.edu.co,,"Rodriguez Sanjuan, Alexander/0000-0001-6424-7254; Villalba, Pedro/0000-0003-3015-0299","Departamento Administrativo de Ciencia, Tecnologia e Innovacion (COLCIENCIAS) [757-2016]; Gobernacion del Atlantico [809-2018]","Departamento Administrativo de Ciencia, Tecnologia e Innovacion (COLCIENCIAS)(Departamento Administrativo de Ciencia, Tecnologia e Innovacion Colciencias); Gobernacion del Atlantico","This work was funded by Departamento Administrativo de Ciencia, Tecnologia e Innovacion (COLCIENCIAS) grant number 757-2016 (FB) and by Gobernacion del Atlantico call number 809-2018 (AR).

Here we describe the process of assembling the instrument we used to acquire video recordings of single zooplankton and the procedure to obtain size estimates from the recorded videos. Our setup produces accurate size estimates for Daphnia magna (correlation to manual measurements = 0.97), and was also tested with other zooplankton species. Zoobooth is especially advantageous when one needs size measurements of live, individual mesozooplankton. The device is small, portable, and comprised of very affordable and readily available components. It can easily be modified for other purposes, such as studies of coloration or behavior of micro-and macro-plankton.

A typical way to measure marine microplastic pollution involves imaging filtered seawater samples stained with a fluorescent dye to aid in the detection of microplastics. Although traditional fluorescence microscopy allows these particles to be manually counted and detected, this is a resource- and labour-intensive task. Here, we describe a novel, low-cost microscope for automated scanning and detection of microplastics in filtered seawater samples-the EnderScope. This microscope is based on the mechanics of a low-cost 3D printer (Creality Ender 3). The hotend of the printer is replaced with an optics module, allowing for the reliable and calibrated motion system of the 3D printer to be used for automated scanning over a large area (>20 x 20 cm). The EnderScope is capable of both reflected light and fluorescence imaging. In both configurations, we aimed to make the design as simple and cost-effective as possible, for example, by using low-cost LEDs for illumination and lighting gels as emission filters. We believe this tool is a cost-effective solution for microplastic measurement.

Using the presented retention model setup and an automated experimental sequence, the setup has been proven capable of investigating mucoadhesion of differently shaped particles to porcine intestinal tissue.

An appropriately constructed flow cell can be connected to a flow reactor made out of transparent polymeric material such as perfluoroalkoxy (PFA) tubing. The flow cell can be moved to different positions of the tube in order to take measurements at different residence times without having to disassemble the photometer or the flow reactor system. The bespoke photometer was used to determine the residence time distribution (RTD) of various microreactors/micromixers, as well as for measuring the reaction rate constant for the base-induced hydrolysis of p-nitrophenol acetate in a biphasic segmented flow system. Owing to the 1 ms sample acquisition time of the novel device the lengths of individual segments can be measured in real time.","[Glotz, Gabriel; Kappe, C.

Realizing this, we developed a fluorescence-based point-of-care (fPOC) detection system with real-time reverse transcriptase loop-mediated isothermal amplification for rapid and quantitative detection of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus. The system is built based on the Arduino platform compatible with commercially available open-source hardware-software and off-the-shelf electronic components. The fPOC system comprises of three main components: 1) an instrument with integrated heaters, 2) optical detection components, and 3) an injection-molded polymeric cartridge. The system was tested and experimentally proved to be able to use for fast detection of the SARS-CoV-2 virus in real-time in less than 30 min. Preliminary results of testing the performance of the fPOC revealed that the fPOC could detect the SARS-CoV-2 virus at a limit of detection (LOD50%) at two to three copies/microliter (15.36 copies/reaction), which was comparable to reactions run on a standard commercial thermocycler. The performance of the fPOC was evaluated with 12 SARS-CoV-2 clinical throat swab samples that included seven positive and five negative samples, as confirmed by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. The fPOC showed 100% agreement with the commercial thermocycler. This simple design of the fPOC system demonstrates the potential to greatly enhance the practical applicability to develop a totally integrated point-of-care system for rapid on-site screening of the SARS-CoV-2 virus in the management of the pandemic.","[Ngoc, Huynh Van; Quyen, Than Linh; Wolff, Anders] Tech Univ Denmark DTU Bioengn, Dept Biotechnol & Biomed, BioLabChip Grp, Lyngby, Denmark; [Vinayaka, Aaydha Chidambara; Bang, Dang Duong] Tech Univ Denmark DTU Bioengn, Dept Biotechnol & Biomed, Lab Appl Micro & Nanotechnol LAMINATE, Lyngby, Denmark",Technical University of Denmark; Technical University of Denmark,"Ngoc, HV; Wolff, A (corresponding author), Tech Univ Denmark DTU Bioengn, Dept Biotechnol & Biomed, BioLabChip Grp, Lyngby, Denmark.",vannh@dtu.dk; awol@dtu.dk,"Huynh, Van/GSM-7997-2022; Wolff, Anders/B-7601-2011","Quyen, Than Linh/0000-0002-1302-8171; Ngoc, Huynh Van/0000-0003-3093-953X; Aaydha Chidambara, Vinayaka/0000-0003-1813-4560; Wolff, Anders/0000-0001-9596-1215; Bang, Dang Duong/0000-0001-8937-687X","Department of Biotechnology and Biomedicine, Technical University of Denmark, Denmark; EU H2020; VIVALDI [101003562]; Danish government [773422];  [UFM 2,4032020]","Department of Biotechnology and Biomedicine, Technical University of Denmark, Denmark; EU H2020(Horizon 2020); VIVALDI; Danish government;","This study was supported by the Department of Biotechnology and Biomedicine, Technical University of Denmark, Denmark; two EU H2020-funded projects, CORONADX, grant no.101003562 (https://coronadx-project.eu/), and VIVALDI, grant no. 773422 (www.vivaldi-ia.eu), and the Danish government funded project COVIDTESTS (grant no.

First, a virtual control with nonlinear sliding manifolds is designed to achieve position-tracking capability, as well as to guarantee the fast convergence of the UAV to a desired position. Furthermore, an ultimate control is developed for the desired attitude-tracking performance. Various uncertainties, including torque due to the discordance between the centre of mass and rotation and wind disturbances are considered. The Lyapunov stability theorem is then applied step-by-step to prove the asymptotically stable and finite-time convergence in position and attitude controllers. Second, the proposed controller is implemented in an open-source hardware platform for a quadrotor UAV. Both numerical and experimental results are compared to validate the tracking performance for attitude and position control, as well as robustness under disturbances.","[Chung, Wonmo; Son, Hungsun] Ulsan Natl Inst Sci & Technol, Sch Mech Aerosp & Nucl Engn, Ulsan 44919, South Korea; [Girt, Dipak Kumar] Indian Inst Technol Kanpur, Dept Aerosp Engn, Kanpur 208016, Uttar Pradesh, India",Ulsan National Institute of Science & Technology (UNIST); Indian Institute of Technology System (IIT System); Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) - Kanpur,"Son, H (corresponding author), Ulsan Natl Inst Sci & Technol, Sch Mech Aerosp & Nucl Engn, Ulsan 44919, South Korea.",hson@unist.ac.kr,,"Chung, Wonmo/0000-0001-9586-7763",Future Innovation Research Fund of Ulsan National Institute of Science and Technology (UNIST) [1.190003.01]; Development of Multi-degrees of Freedom Spherical Motion Platform [2.190080.01]; Development of Drone System for Ship and Marine Mission of Civil Military Technology Cooperation Center [2.180832.01]; National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) of the Korean National Police Agency [2018M3E2A1081549]; Ministry of Science and ICT for Police Field Customized Research and Development Project,Future Innovation Research Fund of Ulsan National Institute of Science and Technology (UNIST); Development of Multi-degrees of Freedom Spherical Motion Platform; Development of Drone System for Ship and Marine Mission of Civil Military Technology Cooperation Center; National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) of the Korean National Police Agency; Ministry of Science and ICT for Police Field Customized Research and Development Project,"This work was supported in part by the Future Innovation Research Fund of Ulsan National Institute of Science and Technology (UNIST) under Grant 1.190003.01, in part by the Development of Multi-degrees of Freedom Spherical Motion Platform under Grant 2.190080.01, in part by the Development of Drone System for Ship and Marine Mission of Civil Military Technology Cooperation Center under Grant 2.180832.01, in part by the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) of the Korean National Police Agency under Grant 2018M3E2A1081549, and in part by the Ministry of Science and ICT for Police Field Customized Research and Development Project.",,39,5,5,2,14,IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC,PISCATAWAY,"445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA",2169-3536,,,IEEE ACCESS,IEEE Access,,2019,7,,,,,,173549,173558,,10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2956190,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2956190,,,10,"Computer Science, Information Systems; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Telecommunications",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Computer Science; Engineering; Telecommunications,KF6TW,,gold,,,8/15/24,WOS:000509374200177,,0,478,,,

This is particularly challenging in small animal MRI, as higher heart rates combined with a smaller myocardial mass render routine ECG detection challenging. We have developed an open-hardware system that enables continuously running MRI scans to be performed in conjunction with cardio-respiratory gating such that the relaxation-weighted steady state magnetisation is maintained throughout the scan. This requires that the R-wave must be detected reliably even in the presence of rapidly switching gradients, and that data previously acquired that were corrupted by respiratory motion reacquired. The accurately maintained steady-state magnetisation leads to an improvement in image quality and removes alterations in intensity that may otherwise occur throughout the cardiac cycle and impact upon automated image analysis. We describe the hardware required to enable this and demonstrate its application and robust performance using prospectively cardio-respiratory gated CINE imaging that is operated at a single, constant TR.

This mechatronic system is coined 'mu Pump,' and its performance rivals that of commercially available systems, at a fraction of the cost. The pressure accuracy, stability, and resolution are 0.09%, 0.02%, and 0.02% of the full span, respectively. The settling time to reach 2 bar from zero and stabilize is less than 2 s. Material for building a four-channel mu Pump (approx. $3000 USD) or an eight-channel mu Pump (approx. $5000 USD) is approximately a quarter, or a third of the cost of buying a high-end commercial system, respectively. The design rationale is presented, together with documented design details and software, so that the system may be replicated or customized to particular applications. mu Pump can be used for two-phase droplet microfluidics, single-phase microfluidics, gaseous flow microfluidics and any other applications requiring precise fluid handling. mu Pump provides researchers, students, and startups with a cost-effective solution for precise fluid control.

Methods: Forty-eight cylindrical-shaped specimens (10 x 2 mm) were prepared with a nano-hybrid RBC (Clearfil Majesty ES-2) and randomly divided in four groups according to the experimental staining procedure: G1) static immersion in a staining solution (coffee) (44 +/- 1 degrees C); G2) staining cycling between coffee (44 +/- 1 degrees C) and distilled water (37 +/- 1 degrees C) with an experimental staining machine based on Arduino, an Open Source hardware development platform; G3) staining cycles as in G2 + brushing with a low abrasive toothpaste (Relative Dentin Abrasion RDA = 30) (Elmex Sensitive Professional); G4) staining cycles as in G3, with brushing performed with a very strong abrasive toothpaste (RDA = 90) (Lacult Active). Color parameters were recorded at the baseline (T0) after staining procedures (T1) and repolishing (T2) using a spectrophotometer. Color change ( increment E00) and translucency (TP, CR) were evaluated. Data were statistically analyzed (p < 0.05). Results: For increment E00 after staining, Group 1 showed the highest color change and Group 3 the lowest. All groups were significantly different (p < 0.001) except for Group 2 vs. Group 4; after repolishing, Group 1 was significantly higher than Group 3 (p < 0.001), Group 2 (p < 0.001), and Group 4 (p = 0.003); Group 2 was higher than Group 3 (p < 0.001). For TP variable, after staining procedures, Group 2 was significantly higher than all other groups (p < 0.001), and Group 1 was significantly higher than Group 3 (p < 0.001) and Group 4 (p = 0.007). After repolishing, Group 4 was significantly lower than Group 3 (p = 0.008) and Group 2 (p = 0.027). Repolishing procedure significantly reduced color parameters. Conclusions: The investigated staining procedure induced significant differences in color stability and translucency. The use of a very strong abrasive toothpaste (RDA = 90) induced higher color change than a low abrasive one (RDA = 30). Repolishing procedures are able to partially reduce color change induced by artificial staining procedures.","[Paolone, Gaetano; Boggio, Francesca; Gherlone, Enrico; Cantatore, Giuseppe] Univ Vita Salute San Raffaele, IRCCS San Raffaele Hosp, Dent Sch, I-20132 Milan, Italy; [Mazzitelli, Claudia; Breschi, Lorenzo] Univ Bologna, Dept Biomed & Neuromotor Sci, DIBINEM, Alma Mater Studiorum, Via San Vitale 59, I-40125 Bologna, Italy; [Vichi, Alessandro] Univ Portsmouth, Dent Acad, William Beatty Bldg, Hampshire Terrace, Portsmouth PO1 2QG, England",Vita-Salute San Raffaele University; IRCCS Ospedale San Raffaele; University of Bologna; University of Portsmouth,"Paolone, G (corresponding author), Univ Vita Salute San Raffaele, IRCCS San Raffaele Hosp, Dent Sch, I-20132 Milan, Italy.",paolone.gaetano@hsr.it,"Cantatore, Giuseppe/JVO-5961-2024; Gherlone, Enrico/M-7376-2016","Cantatore, Giuseppe/0009-0006-1535-4014; Vichi, Alessandro/0000-0002-1158-5388; Paolone, Gaetano/0000-0002-8967-6132; Gherlone, Enrico/0000-0002-5193-8467; Breschi, Lorenzo/0000-0001-7621-226X",,,,,46,5,5,2,8,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,1996-1944,,MATERIALS,Materials,MAR,2023,16,6,,,,,,,2336,10.3390/ma16062336,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ma16062336,,,13,"Chemistry, Physical; Materials Science, Multidisciplinary; Metallurgy & Metallurgical Engineering; Physics, Applied; Physics, Condensed Matter",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Chemistry; Materials Science; Metallurgy & Metallurgical Engineering; Physics,A9WM6,36984216,"Green Published, gold",,,8/15/24,WOS:000958547500001,,0,483,,,

This is achieved by measuring optical density at 600 nm using a spectrophotometer, which measures the effect of absorbance and side scattering due to turbidity of cells suspensions. However, when growth kinetics must be monitored in many 96-well plates at the same time, buying several 96-channel spectrophotometers is often beyond budgets. The MiniRead device presented here is a simple and inexpensive do-it-yourself 96-well temperature-controlled turbidimeter designed to measure the interception of white light via absorption or side scattering through liquid culture medium. Turbidity is automatically recorded in each well at regular time intervals for up to several days or weeks. Output tabulated text files are recorded into a micro-SD memory card to be easily transferred to a computer. We propose also an R package which allows (1) to compute the nonlinear calibration curves required to convert raw readings into cell concentration values, and (2) to analyze growth kinetics output files to automatically estimate proxies of growth parameters such as lag time, maximum growth rate, or cell concentration at the plateau. The MiniRead is a simple and cheap open-hardware open-source do-it-yourself turbidimeter. It allows to automatically monitor growth kinetics of micro-organisms in 96-well plate format, and computes proxies of maximum growth rate, lag time, and cell concentration at the plateau. image We present a simple and inexpensive do-it-yourself turbidimeter for cell suspensions.

Furthermore, because ELISA requires relatively large sample volumes and protein concentrations, it is difficult using this technique to determine protein content for multiple cytokines from individual samples. Recently, Luminex has developed an open source hardware platform combining flow cytometry- and bead-based antibody capture that is capable of detecting multiple analytes from a single sample. In the present study we employed the Luminex 2000 platform to determine the cytokine protein content in discrete brain regions of C57BL/6J mice. In spike-and-recovery experiments, known concentrations of murine recombinant interleukin (IL)-1, 1 beta, IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)alpha were added either singly or as a mixture of all three to whole brain homogenates containing known quantities of total protein. Spiked samples were assayed for either a single cytokine or for multiple cytokines using 1-plex or 3-plex assay kits, respectively. In whole mouse brain homogenate we recovered between 81% and 103% of the recombinant cytokines. We then injected C57BL/6J mice intraperitoneally with bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and sacrificed them 4 h later. We detected in samples taken from LPS-stimulated mice 4- to 870-fold increases in serum or spleen cytokine protein, and 1.5- to 16-fold increases in cytokine protein in discrete brain regions, relative to protein content in samples obtained from vehicle-treated animals. These results indicate that multiple cytokines may be reliably assayed from discrete regions of mouse brain using a single sample. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Methods: The hardware comprises a home-built 8-channel pTx system (scalable to 32-channels), wideband power amplifiers and a positioning system with submillimeter precision. The orthogonal projection (OP) method is used to mitigate RF induced tip heating and to maintain sufficientB1+for imaging. Experiments are performed at 297MHz and inside a clinical 3T MRI using 8-channel pTx RF coils, a guidewire substitute inside a phantom with attached thermistor and time-domainE-field probes. Results: Repeatability and precision are similar to 3% forE-field measurements including guidewire repositioning, similar to 3% for temperature slopes and an similar to 6% root-mean-square deviation betweenB1+measurements and simulations. Real-time pTx mitigation with the OP mode reduces theE-fields everywhere within the investigated area with a maximum reduction factor of 26 compared to the circularly polarized mode. Tip heating was measured with similar to 100 mu K resolution and similar to 14 Hz sampling frequency and showed substantial reduction for the OP vs CP mode. Conclusion: The pTx medical implant safety testbed presents a much-needed flexible and modular hardware configuration for the in-vitro assessment of implant safety, covering all field strengths from 0.5-7 T. Sensor based real-time mitigation strategies utilizing pTx and the OP method allow to substantially reduce RF induced implant heating while maintaining sufficient image quality without the need for a priori knowledge based on simulations or in-vitro testing.","[Winter, Lukas; Silemek, Berk; Petzold, Johannes; Pfeiffer, Harald; Hoffmann, Werner; Seifert, Frank; Ittermann, Bernd] Phys Tech Bundesanstalt PTB, Braunschweig, Germany; [Winter, Lukas; Silemek, Berk; Petzold, Johannes; Pfeiffer, Harald; Hoffmann, Werner; Seifert, Frank; Ittermann, Bernd] Phys Tech Bundesanstalt PTB, Berlin, Germany",Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt (PTB); Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt (PTB),"Winter, L (corresponding author), Phys Tech Bundesanstalt PTB, Biomed Magnet Resonance 8 1, Abbestr 2-12, D-10587 Berlin, Germany.",lukas.winter@ptb.de,"Silemek, Berk/Q-8425-2017","Silemek, Berk/0000-0001-8227-3632; Petzold, Johannes/0000-0001-9503-0998; Winter, Lukas/0000-0002-4381-275X",EMPIR grant [17IND01 MIMAS]; European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation program; EMPIR,EMPIR grant; European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation program(Horizon 2020); EMPIR,This work was funded by the EMPIR grant 17IND01 MIMAS.

Because of its efficiency and speed of analysis, capillary electrophoresis (CE) is a prospective method for the monitoring of a flow composition withdrawn from various processes (e.g., occurring in bioreactors, fermentations, enzymatic assays, and microdialysis samples). However, interfacing CE to a various flow of interest requires further study. In this paper, several ingenious approaches on interfacing flow from various chemical or bioprocesses to a capillary electrophoresis instrument are reviewed. Most of these interfaces can be described as computer-controlled autosamplers. Even though most of the described interfaces waste too many samples, many interesting and important applications of the devices are reported. However, the lack of commercially available devices prevents the wide application of CE for flow analysis. On the contrary, this fact opens up a potential avenue for future research in the field of flow sampling by CE.","[Kaljurand, Mihkel; Saar-Reismaa, Piret; Vaher, Merike; Gorbatsova, Jelena; Mazina-Sinkar, Jekaterina] Tallinn Univ Technol, Inst Chem & Biotechnol, Fac Sci, EE-19089 Tallinn, Estonia",Tallinn University of Technology,"Kaljurand, M (corresponding author), Tallinn Univ Technol, Inst Chem & Biotechnol, Fac Sci, EE-19089 Tallinn, Estonia.",mihkel@chemnet.ee; piret.saar1@taltech.ee; merike.vaher@taltech.ee; jelenagorbatsova@gmail.com; jekaterina.mazina@taltech.ee,/U-7550-2017,"/0000-0002-2430-0097; Vaher, Merike/0000-0002-3818-1906; Gorbatsova, Jelena/0000-0002-5903-6337","Estonian Ministry of Education and Research [IUT 3320, EAG14]; SA Archimedes (""Development of additional analytical capabilities for Estonian Center of Analytical Chemistry"" (AKKI))","Estonian Ministry of Education and Research(Ministry of Education and Research, Estonia); SA Archimedes (""Development of additional analytical capabilities for Estonian Center of Analytical Chemistry"" (AKKI))","This research was funded by the Estonian Ministry of Education and Research (grant numbers IUT 3320 and EAG14) and SA Archimedes (""Development of additional analytical capabilities for Estonian Center of Analytical Chemistry"" (AKKI)).",,32,6,7,1,24,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,1420-3049,,MOLECULES,Molecules,AUG,2021,26,16,,,,,,,4918,10.3390/molecules26164918,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/molecules26164918,,,12,"Biochemistry & Molecular Biology; Chemistry, Multidisciplinary",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Biochemistry & Molecular Biology; Chemistry,UH8GS,34443507,"Green Published, gold",,,8/15/24,WOS:000690162600001,,0,487,,,

The running plant temperatures are the fundamental parameter to evaluate the system performance such as proper operation, and the control and management system has to consider these parameters. A solar energy-powered wireless-based smart object was developed, able to monitor the running temperatures of a solar thermal system and aimed at moving beyond standard monitoring approaches to achieve a low-cost and customizable device, even in terms of installation in different environmental conditions. To this end, two types of communications were used: the first is a low-cost communication based on the ZigBee protocol used for control purposes, so that it can be customized according to specific needs, while the second is based on a Bluetooth protocol used for data display.","[Salamone, Francesco; Belussi, Lorenzo; Danza, Ludovico; Ghellere, Matteo; Meroni, Italo] Natl Res Council Italy ITC CNR, Construct Technol Inst, I-20098 San Giuliano Milanese, MI, Italy",Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche (CNR); Istituto per le Tecnologie della Costruzione (ITC-CNR),"Salamone, F (corresponding author), Natl Res Council Italy ITC CNR, Construct Technol Inst, Via Lombardia 49, I-20098 San Giuliano Milanese, MI, Italy.",salamone@itc.cnr.it; belussi@itc.cnr.it; danza@itc.cnr.it; ghellere@itc.cnr.it; meroni@itc.cnr.it,"Danza, Ludovico/AAW-3770-2020; Danza, Ludovico/B-6954-2015; Belussi, Lorenzo/C-7504-2017; Salamone, Francesco/O-4213-2015","Danza, Ludovico/0000-0003-3305-4008; Danza, Ludovico/0000-0003-3305-4008; Belussi, Lorenzo/0000-0002-1341-0602; Salamone, Francesco/0000-0003-3215-3979; Ghellere, Matteo/0000-0001-8448-3705",National Research Council of Italy (CNR); Lombardy Region in the framework of the research project INTEGRATE (INnovazioni TEcnologiche per una Gestione RAzionale del Tessuto Edilizio),National Research Council of Italy (CNR)(Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche (CNR)); Lombardy Region in the framework of the research project INTEGRATE (INnovazioni TEcnologiche per una Gestione RAzionale del Tessuto Edilizio),This work has been supported within the Framework Agreement between the National Research Council of Italy (CNR) and the Lombardy Region in the framework of the research project INTEGRATE (INnovazioni TEcnologiche per una Gestione RAzionale del Tessuto Edilizio).,,19,19,19,0,30,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,1424-8220,,SENSORS-BASEL,Sensors,NOV,2015,15,11,,,,,27990,28004,,10.3390/s151127990,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/s151127990,,,15,"Chemistry, Analytical; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Instruments & Instrumentation",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Chemistry; Engineering; Instruments & Instrumentation,CX4QW,26556356,"Green Submitted, gold, Green Published",,,8/15/24,WOS:000365686400028,,0,489,,,

A slurry doser was designed to replace the plastic extruder of an open-source Prusa i3 printer. The optimal parameters for 3D printing of layers were studied, and the planar chromatographic separations on these printed layers were successfully demonstrated with a mixture of dyes. The layer printing process was fast. For printing a 0.2 mm layer on a 10 cm √ó 10 cm format, it took less than 5 min. It was affordable, i.e., the running costs for producing such a plate were less than 0.25 Euro and the investment costs for the modified hardware were 630 Euro. This approach demonstrated not only the potential of the 3D printing environment in planar chromatography but also opened new avenues and new perspectives for tailor-made plates, not only with regard to layer materials and their combinations (gradient plates) but also with regard to different layer shapes and patterns. As such an example, separations on a printed plane layer were compared with those obtained from a printed channeled layer. For the latter, 40 channels were printed in parallel on a 10 cm √ó 10 cm format for the separation of 40 samples. For producing such a channeled plate, the running costs were below 0.04 Euro and the printing process took only 2 min. All modifications of the device and software were released open-source to encourage reuse and improvements and to stimulate the users to contribute to this technology. By this proof-of-principle, another asset was demonstrated to be integrated into the Office Chromatography concept, in which all relevant steps for online miniaturized planar chromatography are performed by a single device.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,490,,,

However, affordable tools are often constrained to short-term studies due to high energy consumption and limited storage. To enable long-term monitoring, energy and space efficiency must be improved on such tools. This paper describes the development and deployment of three acoustic detection algorithms that reduce the power and storage requirements of acoustic monitoring on affordable, open-source hardware. The algorithms aim to detect bat echolocation, to search for evidence of an endangered cicada species, and also to collect evidence of poaching in a protected nature reserve. The algorithms are designed to run on AudioMoth: a low-cost, open-source acoustic monitoring device, developed by the authors and widely adopted by the conservation community. Each algorithm addresses a detection task of increasing complexity, implementing extra analytical steps to account for environmental conditions such as wind, analysing samples multiple times to prevent missed events, and incorporating a hidden Markov model for sample classification in both the time and frequency domain. For each algorithm, we report on real-world deployments carried out with partner organisations and also benchmark the hidden Markov model against a convolutional neural network, a deep-learning technique commonly used for acoustics. The deployments demonstrate how acoustic detection algorithms extend the use of low-cost, open-source hardware and facilitate a new avenue for conservation researchers to perform large-scale monitoring.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,492,,,

The sensors provide a continuous flow of data about the environment in which they are deployed, which is received and processed to build a dynamic estimation of the situation. With current technology, it is relatively simple to deploy a set of sensors in a specific geographic area, in order to have highly sensorized spaces. However, to be able to fusion and process the information coming from the data sources of a highly sensorized space, it is necessary to solve certain problems inherent to this type of technology. The challenge is analogous to what we can find in the field of the Internet of Things (IoT). IoT technology is characterized by providing the infrastructure capacity to capture, store, and process a huge amount of heterogeneous sensor data (in most cases, from different manufacturers), in the same way that it occurs in data fusion applications. This work is not simple, mainly due to the fact that there is no standardization of the technologies involved (especially within the communication protocols used by the connectable sensors). The solutions that we can find today are proprietary solutions that imply an important dependence and a high cost. The aim of this paper is to present a new open source platform with capabilities for the collection, management and analysis of a huge amount of heterogeneous sensor data. In addition, this platform allows the use of hardware-agnostic in a highly scalable and cost-effective manner. This platform is called Thinger.io. One of the main characteristics of Thinger.io is the ability to model sensorized environments through a high level language that allows a simple and easy implementation of data fusion applications, as we will show in this paper.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,498,,,

It is a floating-point system that trades exponent bits for significand bits, depending on the magnitude of the numbers. Thus, it provides more precision for numbers around 1, at the expense of lower precision for very large or very small numbers. Several works have demonstrated that this trade-off can improve the accuracy of applications. However, the variable-length exponent and significand encoding impacts the hardware cost of posit arithmetic. The objective of the present work is to enable application-level evaluations of the posit system that include performance and resource consumption. To this purpose, this article introduces an open-source hardware implementation of the posit number system, in the form of a C++ templatized library compatible with Vivado HLS. This library currently implements addition, subtraction and multiplication for custom-size posits. In addition, the posit standard also mandates the presence of the ""quire"", a large accumulator able to perform exact sums of products. The proposed library includes the first open-source parameterized hardware quire. This library is shown to improve the state-of-the-art of posit implementations in terms of latency and resource consumption. Still, standard 32 bits posit adders and multipliers are found to be much larger and slower than the corresponding floating-point operators. The cost of the posit 32 quire is shown to be comparable to that of a Kulisch accumulator for 32 bits floating-point.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,499,,,

This article describes the implementation and accuracy evaluation of a micro-architectural simulator of Cortex-A cores, supporting in-order and out-of-order pipelines and based on the open-source gem5 simulator. We explain how to simulate CortexA8 and Cortex-A9 cores in gem5, and compare the execution time of ten benchmarks with real hardware.

The model data plane enables testing changes made to the control plane before integrating with a performant data plane, and vice versa.

Here we argue that also modern evolutionary computation can significantly benefit from the massive computational throughput provided by GPUs and TPUs. In order to better harness these resources and to enable the next generation of black-box optimization algorithms, we release evosax : A JAX-based library of evolution strategies which allows researchers to leverage powerful function transformations such as just-in-time compilation, automatic vectorization and hardware parallelization.1 evosax implements 30 evolutionary optimization algorithms including finite-difference-based, estimation-of-distribution evolution strategies and various genetic algorithms. Every single algorithm can directly be executed on hardware accelerators and automatically vectorized or parallelized across devices using a single line of code.

Through these applications we demonstrate that the platform allows easy and virtually unlimited datalogging, monitoring, and analysis of real-time sensor data with low setup costs.

In particular, we posit that this open source fingerprint reader will facilitate the exploration of novel fingerprint spoof detection techniques involving both hardware and software. We demonstrate one such spoof detection technique by specially customizing RaspiReader with two cameras for fingerprint image acquisition. One camera provides high contrast, frustrated total internal reflection (FTIR) fingerprint images, and the other outputs direct images of the finger in contact with the platen. Using both of these image streams, we extract complementary information which, when fused together and used for spoof detection, results in marked performance improvement over previous methods relying only on grayscale FTIR images provided by COTS optical readers. Finally, fingerprint matching experiments between images acquired from the FTIR output of RaspiReader and images acquired from a COTS reader verify the interoperability of the RaspiReader with existing COTS optical readers.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,536,,,

An open-loop-VSI-based PA is shown to be accurate in emulating a synchronous generator, including the fast transients in the excitation control system.

Consequently, many algorithms have been developed to minimize the number of I/O operations for common computing patterns. Matrix multiplication is no exception, and lower bounds have been proven and implemented both for shared and distributed memory systems. Reconfigurable hardware platforms are a lucrative target for I/O minimizing algorithms, as they offer full control of memory accesses to the programmer. While bounds developed in the context of fixed architectures still apply to these platforms, the spatially distributed nature of their computational and memory resources requires a decentralized approach to optimize algorithms for maximum hardware utilization. We present a model to optimize matrix multiplication for FPGA platforms, simultaneously targeting maximum performance and minimum off-chip data movement, within constraints set by the hardware. We map the model to a concrete architecture using a high-level synthesis tool, maintaining a high level of abstraction, allowing us to support arbitrary data types, and enables maintainability and portability across FPGA devices.

In this paper, we aim to address a common bottleneck in the RL training system, i.e., parallel environment execution, which is often the slowest part of the whole system but receives little attention. With a curated design for paralleling RL environments, we have improved the RL environment simulation speed across different hardware setups, ranging from a laptop and a modest workstation, to a high-end machine such as NVIDIA DGX-A100. On a high-end machine, EnvPool achieves one million frames per second for the environment execution on Atari environments and three million frames per second on MuJoCo environments. When running EnvPool on a laptop, the speed is 2.8x that of the Python subprocess. Moreover, great compatibility with existing RL training libraries has been demonstrated in the open-sourced community, including CleanRL, rl_games, DeepMind Acme, etc. Finally, EnvPool allows researchers to iterate their ideas at a much faster pace and has great potential to become the de facto RL environment execution engine.

Passive prostheses lead amputees to walk slower, use more energy, fall more often, and modify their gait patterns to compensate for the prosthesis' lack of net-positive mechanical energy. Robotic prostheses can provide mechanical energy, but may also introduce challenges through controller design. Fortunately, talented researchers are studying how to best control robotic leg prostheses, but the time and resources required to develop prosthetic hardware has limited their potential impact. Even after research is completed, comparison of results is confounded by the use of different, researcher-specific hardware. To address these issues, we have developed the Open-source Leg (OSL): a scalable robotic knee/ankle prosthesis intended to foster investigations of control strategies. This paper introduces the design goals, transmission selection, hardware implementation, and initial control benchmarks for the OSL. The OSL provides a common hardware platform for comparison of control strategies, lowers the barrier to entry for prosthesis research, and enables testing within the lab, community, and at home.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,554,,,

The multi-fluorescence imaging system consists of readily available 470 nm LEDs, a Raspberry Pi camera and a set of filters made with low cost acrylics. This device allows imaging in scales ranging from single colonies to entire plates. We developed a set of genetic components (e.g. promoters, coding sequences, terminators) and vectors following the standard framework of Golden Gate, which allowed the fabrication of genetic constructs in a combinatorial, low cost and robust manner. In order to provide simultaneous imaging of multiple wavelength signals, we screened a series of long stokes shift fluorescent proteins that could be combined with cyan/green fluorescent proteins. We found CyOFP1, mBeRFP and sfGFP to be the most compatible set for 3-channel fluorescent imaging. We developed open source Python code to operate the hardware to run time-lapse experiments with automated control of illumination and camera and a Python module to analyze data and extract meaningful biological information. To demonstrate the potential application of this integral system, we tested its performance on a diverse range of imaging assays often used in disciplines such as microbial ecology, microbiology and synthetic biology.

Optical motion capture systems are the current standard for estimating kinematics but require expensive equipment located in a predefined space. While wearable sensor systems can estimate kinematics in any environment, existing systems are generally less accurate than optical motion capture. Further, many wearable sensor systems require a computer in close proximity and rely on proprietary software, making it difficult for researchers to reproduce experimental findings. Here, we present OpenSenseRT, an open-source and wearable system that estimates upper and lower extremity kinematics in real time by using inertial measurement units and a portable microcontroller. We compared the OpenSenseRT system to optical motion capture and found an average RMSE of 4.4 degrees across 5 lower-limb joint angles during three minutes of walking (n = 5) and an average RMSE of 5.6 degrees across 8 upper extremity joint angles during a Fugl-Meyer task (n = 5). The open-source software and hardware are scalable, tracking between 1 and 14 body segments, with one sensor per segment. Kinematics are estimated in real-time using a musculoskeletal model and inverse kinematics solver. The computation frequency, depends on the number of tracked segments, but is sufficient for real-time measurement for many tasks of interest; for example, the system can track up to 7 segments at 30 Hz in real-time. The system uses off-the-shelf parts costing approximately $100 USD plus $20 for each tracked segment.

Our aim was to design and test an affordable and easy-to-build noninvasive bilevel pressure ventilator to allow a reduction in the serious shortage of ventilators in LMICs. Methods The ventilator was built using off-the-shelf materials available via e-commerce and was based on a high-pressure blower, two pressure transducers and an Arduino Nano controller with a digital display (total retail cost <75‚ÄÖUSD), with construction details provided open source for free replication. The ventilator was evaluated, and compared with a commercially available device (Lumis 150 ventilator; Resmed, San Diego, CA, USA): 1) in the bench setting using an actively breathing patient simulator mimicking a range of obstructive/restrictive diseases; and b) in 12 healthy volunteers wearing high airway resistance and thoracic/abdominal bands to mimic obstructive/restrictive patients. Results The designed ventilator provided inspiratory/expiratory pressures up to 20/10‚ÄÖcmH2O, respectively, with no faulty triggering or cycling; both in the bench test and in volunteers. The breathing difficulty score rated (1‚Äì10 scale) by the loaded breathing subjects was significantly (p<0.005) decreased from 5.45¬±1.68 without support to 2.83¬±1.66 when using the prototype ventilator, which showed no difference with the commercial device (2.80¬±1.48; p=1.000). Conclusion The low-cost, easy-to-build noninvasive ventilator performs similarly to a high-quality commercial device, with its open-source hardware description, which will allow for free replication and use in LMICs, facilitating application of this life-saving therapy to patients who otherwise could not be treated.

Such architectures exhibit non-uniform memory access latency as well as non-uniform thread communication costs. Unfortunately, traditional shared-everything database management systems are designed for uniform inter-core communication speeds. This causes unpredictable access latencies in the critical path. While lack of data locality may be a minor nuisance on systems with fewer than 4 processors, it becomes a serious scalability limitation on larger systems due to accesses to centralized data structures. In this paper, we propose ATraPos, a storage manager design that is aware of the non-uniform access latencies of multisocket systems. ATraPos achieves good data locality by carefully partitioning the data as well as internal data structures (e.g., state information) to the available processors and by assigning threads to specific partitions. Furthermore, ATraPos dynamically adapts to the workload characteristics, i.e., when the workload changes, ATraPos detects the change and automatically revises the data partitioning and thread placement to fit the current access patterns and hardware topology. We prototype ATraPos on top of an open-source storage manager Shore-MT and we present a detailed experimental analysis with both synthetic and standard (TPC-C and TATP) benchmarks.

The microvalves were fabricated using thin sheets of PDMS and patterned using CO2 laser engraving, providing a simple and efficient way to fabricate devices without the traditional photolithographic process or facilities. Synchronization of valve control enabled the development of two simple devices to perform injection (1.6 ¬± 0.4 ŒºL/stroke) and mixing of different solutions. Furthermore, a practical demonstration of the utility of this system for microscale chemical sample handling and analysis was achieved performing an on‚Äêchip acid‚Äìbase titration, followed by conductivity detection with an open‚Äêsource low‚Äêcost detection system.

MCMs are defined at the various layers of the hardware-software stack, requiring thoroughly verified specifications, compilers, and implementations at the interfaces between layers. Current verification techniques evaluate segments of the system stack in isolation, such as proving compiler mappings from a high-level language (HLL) to an ISA or proving validity of a microarchitectural implementation of an ISA. This paper makes a case for full-stack MCM verification and provides a toolflow, TriCheck, capable of verifying that the HLL, compiler, ISA, and implementation collectively uphold MCM requirements. The work showcases TriCheck's ability to evaluate a proposed ISA MCM in order to ensure that each layer and each mapping is correct and complete. Specifically, we apply TriCheck to the open source RISC-V ISA [55], seeking to verify accurate, efficient, and legal compilations from C11. We uncover under-specifications and potential inefficiencies in the current RISC-V ISA documentation and identify possible solutions for each. As an example, we find that a RISC-V-compliant microarchitecture allows 144 outcomes forbidden by C11 to be observed out of 1,701 litmus tests examined. Overall, this paper demonstrates the necessity of full-stack verification for detecting MCM-related bugs in the hardware-software stack.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,580,,,

Internally, the design of OpenARC uses a high-level intermediate representation that separates concerns of program representation from underlying architectures, which facilitates portability of OpenARC. In fact, this design allowed us to create the OpenACC-to-FPGA translation framework with minimal extensions to our existing system. In addition, we show that our proposed FPGA-specific compiler optimizations and novel OpenACC pragma extensions assist the compiler in generating more efficient FPGA hardware configuration files. Our empirical evaluation on an Altera Stratix V FPGA with eight OpenACC benchmarks demonstrate the benefits of our strategy.

Common approaches for measuring liquid intake in real time include computer-tethered lickometers or video-based systems. Additionally, liquids can be measured or weighed to determine the amount consumed without real-time sensing. Here, we built a photobeam-based sipper device that has the following advantages over traditional methods: (1) it is battery powered and fits in vivarium caging to allow home-measurements; (2) it quantifies the intake of two different liquids simultaneously for preference studies; (3) it is low cost and easily constructed, enabling high-throughput experiments; and (4) it is open source so that others can modify it to fit their experimental needs. We validated the performance of this device in three experiments. First, we calibrated our device using time-lapse video-based measurements of liquid intake and correlated sipper interactions with liquid intake. Second, we used the sipper device to measure preference for water versus chocolate milk, demonstrating its utility for two-bottle choice tasks. Third, we integrated the device with fiber photometry, establishing its utility for measuring neural activity in studies of ingestive behavior. This device requires no special equipment or caging, and is small, battery powered, and wireless, allowing it to be placed directly in rodent home cages.

Significance: Spatial frequency domain imaging (SFDI) is a diffuse optical measurement technique that can quantify tissue optical absorption (Œºa) and reduced scattering (Œºs‚Ä≤) on a pixel-by-pixel basis. Measurements of Œºa at different wavelengths enable the extraction of molar concentrations of tissue chromophores over a wide field, providing a noncontact and label-free means to assess tissue viability, oxygenation, microarchitecture, and molecular content. We present here openSFDI: an open-source guide for building a low-cost, small-footprint, three-wavelength SFDI system capable of quantifying Œºa and Œºs‚Ä≤ as well as oxyhemoglobin and deoxyhemoglobin concentrations in biological tissue. The companion website provides a complete parts list along with detailed instructions for assembling the openSFDI system. Aim: We describe the design of openSFDI and report on the accuracy and precision of optical property extractions for three different systems fabricated according to the instructions on the openSFDI website. Approach: Accuracy was assessed by measuring nine tissue-simulating optical phantoms with a physiologically relevant range of Œºa and Œºs‚Ä≤ with the openSFDI systems and a commercial SFDI device. Precision was assessed by repeatedly measuring the same phantom over 1 h. Results: The openSFDI systems had an error of 0‚Äâ‚Äâ¬±‚Äâ‚Äâ6‚Äâ‚Äâ%‚Äâ‚Äâ in Œºa and ‚àí2‚Äâ‚Äâ¬±‚Äâ‚Äâ3‚Äâ‚Äâ%‚Äâ‚Äâ in Œºs‚Ä≤, compared to a commercial SFDI system.

Specifically, we coordinate releases from two internet-controlled stormwater basins to achieve desired control objectives downstream such as maintaining the flow at a set-point, and generating interleaved waves. In the first part of the study, we describe the construction of the control network using a low-cost, open-source hardware stack and a cloud-based controller scheduling application. Next, we characterize the system's control capabilities by determining the travel times, decay times, and magnitudes of various waves released from the upstream retention basins. With this characterization in hand, we use the system to generate two desired responses at a critical downstream junction. First, we generate a set-point hydrograph, in which flow is maintained at an approximately constant rate. Next, we generate a series of overlapping and interleaved waves using timed releases from both retention basins.

Closed-loop experiments provide unique insights into brain dynamics and function. To facilitate a wide range of closed-loop experiments, we created an open-source software platform that enables high-performance real-time processing of streaming experimental data. Approach. We wrote Falcon, a C++ multi-threaded software in which the user can load and execute an arbitrary processing graph. Each node of a Falcon graph is mapped to a single thread and nodes communicate with each other through thread-safe buffers. The framework allows for easy implementation of new processing nodes and data types. Falcon was tested both on a 32-core and a 4-core workstation. Streaming data was read from either a commercial acquisition system (Neuralynx) or the open-source Open Ephys hardware, while closed-loop TTL pulses were generated with a USB module for digital output. We characterized the round-trip latency of our Falcon-based closed-loop system, as well as the specific latency contribution of the software architecture, by testing processing graphs with up to 32 parallel pipelines and eight serial stages. We finally deployed Falcon in a task of real-time detection of population bursts recorded live from the hippocampus of a freely moving rat. Main results. On Neuralynx hardware, round-trip latency was well below 1‚Äâms and stable for at least 1 h, while on Open Ephys hardware latencies were below 15‚Äâms. The latency contribution of the software was below 0.5‚Äâms. Round-trip and software latencies were similar on both 32- and 4-core workstations. Falcon was used successfully to detect population bursts online with ~40‚Äâms average latency. Significance. Falcon is a novel open-source software for closed-loop neuroscience. It has sub-millisecond intrinsic latency and gives the experimenter direct control of CPU resources. We envisage Falcon to be a useful tool to the neuroscientific community for implementing a wide variety of closed-loop experiments, including those requiring use of complex data structures and real-time execution of computationally intensive algorithms, such as population neural decoding/encoding from large cell assemblies.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,627,,,

However, to provide high-quality partitioning, this engine must be able to consider a rich design space of possible alternate hardware and software implementations for each program region candidate for hardware acceleration, in turn making the task of finding the optimal mapping very difficult given the number of design points to consider and the need for accurate modeling of latency, power and area. In this work we propose a novel framework to enable hardware acceleration of performance-critical parts of an application, by addressing the problem of hardware/software partitioning under power and area constraints to minimize the overall program latency. Our flow is based on the LLVM compiler, and focuses on building a scalable compile-time partitioning algorithm while considering large sets of alternative hardware and software implementations for a particular region. To this end we develop a hybrid approach based on mixing semi-random selection of hardware design points and an Integer Linear Programming formulation of the mapping decision, along with iterative refinements of the solution. Experimental results demonstrate the capability of our approach to consider complex designs and yet output near-optimal partitioning decision.

First, a com-pact, mobile system was built using an infrared gas analyzer combined with open-source hardware to control, georeference, and log measurements of CO2 mixing ratios on ve-hicles (car, bicycles). Second, two measurement campaigns, one in summer and one in winter (heating season) were carried out. Five mobile sensors were deployed within a 1x12.7 km transect across the city of Vancouver, BC, Canada. The sensors were operated for 3.5 h on pre-defined routes to map CO2 mixing ratios at street level, which were then averaged to 100 x 100m grid cells. The averaged CO2 mixing ratios of all grids in the study area were 417.9 ppm in summer and 442.5 ppm in winter. In both campaigns, mixing ratios were highest in the grid cells of the downtown core and along arterial roads and lowest in parks and well vegetated residential areas. Third, an aerodynamic resistance approach to calculating emissions was used to derive CO2 emissions from the gridded CO2 mixing ratio mea-surements in conjunction with mixing ratios and fluxes collected from a 28 m tall eddycovariance tower located within the study area. These measured emissions showed a range of 12 to 226CO(2) ha 1 h 1 in summer and of -14 to 163 kgCO(2) ha 1 h 1 in winter, with an average of 35.1 kgCO(2) ha (-1) h (-1) (summer) and 25.9 kgCO(2) ha 1 h 1 (winter). Fourth, an independent emissions inventory was developed for the study area using buildings energy simulations from a previous study and routinely available traffic counts. The emissions inventory for the same area averaged to 22.06 kgCO(2) ha (-1) h (-1) (summer) and 28.76 kgCO(2) ha (-1) h (-1) (winter) and was used to compare against the measured emissions from the mobile sensor network. The comparison on a grid-by-grid basis showed linearity between CO2 mixing ratios and the emissions inventory (R (2) =53 in summer and R (2) = 47 in winter). Also, 87% (summer) and 94% (winter) of measured grid cells show a difference within +/- 1 order of magnitude, and 49% (summer) and 69% (winter) show an error of less than a factor 2. Although associated with considerable errors at the individual grid cell level, the study demonstrates a promising method of using a network of mobile sensors and an aerody-namic resistance approach to rapidly map greenhouse gases at high spatial resolution across cities. The method could be improved by longer measurements and a refined calculation of the aerodynamic resistance.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,631,,,

It couples a large FPGA with a server-class CPU in an asymmetric cache-coherent NUMA system. Enzian also enables research not possible with existing hybrid platforms, through explicit access to coherence messages, extensive thermal and power instrumentation, and an open, programmable baseboard management processor.

A QSS includes a quantum programming language, an optimizing compiler that translates a quantum algorithm written in a high-level language into quantum gate instructions, a quantum simulator that emulates these instructions on a classical device, and a software controller that sends analog signals to a very expensive quantum hardware based on quantum circuits. In comparison to traditional compilers and architecture simulators, QSSes are difficult to tests due to the probabilistic nature of results, the lack of clear hardware specifications, and quantum programming complexity.This work devises a novel differential testing approach for QSSes, named QDiff with three major innovations: (1) We generate input programs to be tested via semantics-preserving, source to source transformation to explore program variants. (2) We speed up differential testing by filtering out quantum circuits that are not worthwhile to execute on quantum hardware by analyzing static characteristics such as a circuit depth, 2-gate operations, gate error rates, and T1 relaxation time. (3) We design an extensible equivalence checking mechanism via distribution comparison functions such as Kolmogorov‚ÄìSmirnov test and cross entropy.We evaluate QDiff with three widely-used open source QSSes: Qiskit from IBM, Cirq from Google, and Pyquil from Rigetti. By running QDiff on both real hardware and quantum simulators, we found several critical bugs revealing potential instabilities in these platforms. QDiff‚Äôs source transformation is effective in producing semantically equivalent yet not-identical circuits (i.e., 34% of trials), and its filtering mechanism can speed up differential testing by 66%.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,633,,,

In this paper, we propose a systematic solution to deploy DNNs on embedded FPGAs, which includes a ternarized hardware Deep Learning Accelerator (T-DLA), and a framework for ternary neural network (TNN) training. T-DLA is a highly optimized hardware unit in FPGA specializing in accelerating the TNNs, while the proposed framework can significantly compress the DNN parameters down to two bits with little accuracy drop. Results show that our training framework can compress the DNN up to 14.14x while maintaining nearly the same accuracy compared to the floating point version. By illustrating our proposed design techniques, the T-DLA can deliver up to 0.4TOPS with 2.576W power consumption, showing 873.6x and 5.1x higher energy efficiency (fps/W) on ImageNet with Resnet-18 model comparing to Xeon E5-2630 CPU and Nvidia 1080 Ti GPU. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first instruction-based highly efficient ternary DLA design reported from the literature.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,643,,,

High performance is obtained through the use of the high-performance BLAS, hardware-specific tuning, and a hybridization methodology whereby we split the algorithm into computational tasks of various granularities.

Although a plethora of software for the acquisition of eye-tracking data exists, they often exhibit critical issues when pervasive eye tracking is considered, e.g., closed source, costly eye tracker hardware dependencies, and requiring a human supervisor for calibration. In this paper, we introduce EyeRecToo , an open-source software for real-time pervasive head-mounted eye-tracking. Out of the box, EyeRecToo offers multiple real-time state-of-the-art pupil detection and gaze estimation methods, which can be easily replaced by user implemented algorithms if desired. A novel calibration method that allows users to calibrate the system without the assistance of a human supervisor is also integrated. Moreover, this software supports multiple head-mounted eye-tracking hardware, records eye and scene videos, and stores pupil and gaze information, which are also available as a real-time stream. Thus, EyeRecToo serves as a framework to quickly enable pervasive eye-tracking research and applications.

The open data is defined as follows: it is publicly available and non-chargeable data (information content) that is machine readable. Open data enables software and application development for external partners and users. A common feature in open-data applications is location-based identification (e.g., real-time traffic monitoring). These include spatial map visualizations, and monitoring of traffic and modes of transport. This visualized information provides additional support for data-based decision-making and management as these study results indicate. This information is valuable particularly in the decisions concerning unconventional and sudden events. This research indicates that the most suitable data resources for opening include information related to port transport infrastructure.

In this way, during last decade the deployment of sensing devices has increased considerably in the field of agriculture. This fact has led to a new concept called smart agriculture, and it contemplates activities such as field monitoring, which offer support to make decisions or perform actions, such as irrigation or fertilization. Apart from sensing devices, which use the Internet protocol to transfer data (Internet of Things), there are the so-called crop models, which are able to provide added value over the data provided by the sensors, with the aim of providing recommendations to farmers in decision-making and thus, increase the quality and quantity of their production. In this scenario, the current work uses a low-cost sensorized platform, capable of monitoring meteorological phenomena following the Internet of Things paradigm, with the goal to apply an alert disease model on the cultivation of the vine. The edge computing paradigm is used to achieve this objective; also our work follows some advances from GIScience to increase interoperability.

We use this data to build HyperProtoBench, an open-source benchmark representative of key serialization-framework user services at scale.

Applications can easily harness the accelerator, as it integrates with a modified version of the open-source protobuf library and is wire-compatible with standard protobufs. We have fully open-sourced our RTL, which, to the best of our knowledge, is the only such implementation currently available to the community.

This paper studies the effect of hardware prefetching on multithreaded code and presents a machine-learning technique to predict the optimal combination of prefetchers for a given application. This technique is based on program characterization and utilizes hardware performance events in conjunction with a pruning algorithm to obtain a concise and expressive feature set. The resulting feature set is used in three different learning models. All necessary steps are implemented in a framework that reaches, on average, 96% of the best possible prefetcher speedup.

Further, new applications such as cloud computing and Internet of Things (IoT) continue to necessitate increased performance and energy efficiency. Manycore processors show potential in addressing some of these issues. However, there is little detailed power and energy data on manycore processors. In this work, we carefully study detailed power and energy characteristics of Piton, a 25-core modern open source academic processor, including voltage versus frequency scaling, energy per instruction (EPI), memory system energy, network-on-chip (NoC) energy, thermal characteristics, and application performance and power consumption. This is the first detailed power and energy characterization of an open source manycore design implemented in silicon. The open source nature of the processor provides increased value, enabling detailed characterization verified against simulation and the ability to correlate results with the design and register transfer level (RTL) model. Additionally, this enables other researchers to utilize this work to build new power models, devise new research directions, and perform accurate power and energy research using the open source processor. The characterization data reveals a number of interesting insights, including that operand values have a large impact on EPI, recomputing data can be more energy efficient than loading it from memory, on-chip data transmission (NoC) energy is low, and insights on energy efficient multithreaded core design.

This large-cat sized, 5.1 kg robot is one of a kind of a recent, bioinspired legged robot class designed with the capability of model-free locomotion control. Animal legged locomotion in rough terrain is clearly shaped by sensor feedback systems. Results with Oncilla robot show that agile and versatile locomotion is possible without sensory signals to some extend, and tracking becomes robust when feedback control is added (Ajallooeian, 2015). By incorporating mechanical and control blueprints inspired from animals, and by observing the resulting robot locomotion characteristics, we aim to understand the contribution of individual components. Legged robots have a wide mechanical and control design parameter space, and a unique potential as research tools to investigate principles of biomechanics and legged locomotion control. But the hardware and controller design can be a steep initial hurdle for academic research. To facilitate the easy start and development of legged robots, Oncilla-robot's blueprints are available through open-source. The robot's locomotion capabilities are shown in several scenarios. Specifically, its spring-loaded pantographic leg design compensates for overdetermined body and leg postures, i.e., during turning maneuvers, locomotion outdoors, or while going up and down slopes. The robot's active degree of freedom allow tight and swift direction changes, and turns on the spot. Presented hardware experiments are conducted in an open-loop manner, with little control and computational effort. For more versatile locomotion control, Oncilla-robot can sense leg joint rotations, and leg-trunk forces. Additional sensors can be included for feedback control with an open communication protocol interface. The robot's customized actuators are designed for robust actuation, and efficient locomotion. It trots with a cost of transport of 3.2 J/(Nm), at a speed of 0.63 m s-1 (Froude number 0.25). The robot trots inclined slopes up to 10¬∞, at 0.25 m s-1. The multi-body Webots model of Oncilla robot, and Oncilla robot's extensive software architecture enables users to design and test scenarios in simulation. Controllers can directly be transferred to the real robot.

The single-qubit and two-qubit process fidelities are measured to be 0.9980 $\pm$ 0.0001 and 0.948 $\pm$ 0.004, respectively, by randomized benchmarking.

Barring a few recent papers, there is limited consensus on which algorithms are effective at this scale vis-\`a-vis their hardware cost. This competition compares ANNS algorithms at billion-scale by hardware cost, accuracy and performance. We set up an open source evaluation framework and leaderboards for both standardized and specialized hardware. The competition involves three tracks. The standard hardware track T1 evaluates algorithms on an Azure VM with limited DRAM, often the bottleneck in serving billion-scale indices, where the embedding data can be hundreds of GigaBytes in size. It uses FAISS~\citep{Faiss17} as the baseline. The standard hardware track T2 additional allows inexpensive SSDs in addition to the limited DRAM and uses DiskANN~\citep{DiskANN19} as the baseline. The specialized hardware track T3 allows any hardware configuration, and again uses FAISS as the baseline.

Meanwhile, graph processing has attracted tremendous interest in data analytics, and its performance is in increasing demand with the rapid growth of data. Many works have been proposed to tackle the challenges of designing efficient FPGA-based accelerators for graph processing. However, the largely overlooked programmability still requires hardware design expertise and sizable development efforts from developers. In order to close the gap, we propose ThunderGP, an open-source HLS-based graph processing framework on FPGAs, with which developers could enjoy the performance of FPGA-accelerated graph processing by writing only a few high-level functions with no knowledge of the hardware. ThunderGP adopts the Gather-Apply-Scatter (GAS) model as the abstraction of various graph algorithms and realizes the model by a build-in highly-paralleled and memory-efficient accelerator template. With high-level functions as inputs, ThunderGP automatically explores the massive resources and memory bandwidth of multiple Super Logic Regions (SLRs) on FPGAs to generate accelerator and then deploys the accelerator and schedules tasks for the accelerator. We evaluate ThunderGP with seven common graph applications. The results show that accelerators on real hardware platforms deliver 2.9 times speedup over the state-of-the-art approach, running at 250MHz and achieving throughput up to 6,400 MTEPS (Million Traversed Edges Per Second).

Here, we present BEAGLE 3 with new parallel implementations, increased performance for challenging data sets, improved scalability, and better usability. We have added new OpenCL and central processing unit-threaded implementations to the library, allowing the effective utilization of a wider range of modern hardware. Further, we have extended the API and library to support concurrent computation of independent partial likelihood arrays, for increased performance of nucleotide-model analyses with greater flexibility of data partitioning. For better scalability and usability, we have improved how phylogenetic software packages use BEAGLE in multi-GPU (graphics processing unit) and cluster environments, and introduced an automated method to select the fastest device given the data set, evolutionary model, and hardware. For application developers who wish to integrate the library, we also have developed an online tutorial. To evaluate the effect of the improvements, we ran a variety of benchmarks on state-of-the-art hardware.

Consequently, data and techniques have been difficult to reproduce across models and laboratories, analysis is time consuming, and only specialist researchers can quantify data. Objective: Here, we describe and validate an automated, open-source software tool (MUSCLEMOTION) adaptable for use with standard laboratory and clinical imaging equipment that enables quantitative analysis of normal cardiac contraction, disease phenotypes, and pharmacological responses. Methods and Results: MUSCLEMOTION allowed rapid and easy measurement of movement from high-speed movies in (1) 1-dimensional in vitro models, such as isolated adult and human pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes; (2) 2-dimensional in vitro models, such as beating cardiomyocyte monolayers or small clusters of human pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes; (3) 3-dimensional multicellular in vitro or in vivo contractile tissues, such as cardiac ‚Äúorganoids,‚Äù engineered heart tissues, and zebrafish and human hearts. MUSCLEMOTION was effective under different recording conditions (bright-field microscopy with simultaneous patch-clamp recording, phase contrast microscopy, and traction force microscopy). Outcomes were virtually identical to the current gold standards for contraction measurement, such as optical flow, post deflection, edge-detection systems, or manual analyses. Finally, we used the algorithm to quantify contraction in in vitro and in vivo arrhythmia models and to measure pharmacological responses. Conclusions: Using a single open-source method for processing video recordings, we obtained reliable pharmacological data and measures of cardiac disease phenotype in experimental cell, animal, and human models.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,735,,,

One such enabling technologies is fog computing, which extends cloud computing to the edge of a network allowing for developing novel Internet of Things (IoT) applications and services. Under the IoT fog computing paradigm, IoT gateways are usually utilized to exchange messages with IoT nodes and a cloud. WiFi and ZigBee stand out as preferred communication technologies for smart homes. WiFi has become very popular, but it has a limited application due to its high energy consumption and the lack of standard mesh networking capabilities for low-power devices. For such reasons, ZigBee was selected by many manufacturers for developing wireless home automation devices. As a consequence, these technologies may coexist in the 2.4 GHz band, which leads to collisions, lower speed rates and increased communications latencies. This article presents ZiWi, a distributed fog computing Home Automation System (HAS) that allows for carrying out seamless communications among ZigBee and WiFi devices. This approach diverges from traditional home automation systems, which often rely on expensive central controllers. In addition, to ease the platform‚Äôs building process, whenever possible, the system makes use of open-source software (all the code of the nodes is available on GitHub) and Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) hardware. The initial results, which were obtained in a number of representative home scenarios, show that the developed fog services respond several times faster than the evaluated cloud services, and that cross-interference has to be taken seriously to prevent collisions. In addition, the current consumption of ZiWi‚Äôs nodes was measured, showing the impact of encryption mechanisms.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,737,,,

This likely contributes to limited translational impact. A major bottleneck for the adoption of socially complex, ethology-rich, preclinical procedures are the technical limitations for consistently annotating detailed behavioral repertoires of rodent social behavior. Manual annotation is subjective, prone to observer drift, and extremely time-intensive. Commercial approaches are expensive and inferior to manual annotation. Open-source alternatives often require significant investments in specialized hardware and significant computational and programming knowledge. By combining recent computational advances in convolutional neural networks and pose-estimation with further machine learning analysis, complex rodent social behavior is primed for inclusion under the umbrella of computational neuroethology. Here we present an open-source package with graphical interface and workflow (Simple Behavioral Analysis, SimBA) that uses pose-estimation to create supervised machine learning predictive classifiers of rodent social behavior, with millisecond resolution and accuracies that can out-perform human observers. SimBA does not require specialized video acquisition hardware nor extensive computational background. Standard descriptive statistical analysis, along with graphical region of interest annotation, are provided in addition to predictive classifier generation. To increase ease-of-use for behavioural neuroscientists, we designed SimBA with accessible menus for pre-processing videos, annotating behavioural training datasets, selecting advanced machine learning options, robust classifier validation functions and flexible visualizations tools. This allows for predictive classifier transparency, explainability and tunability prior to, and during, experimental use. We demonstrate that this approach is flexible and robust in both mice and rats by classifying social behaviors that are commonly central to the study of brain function and social motivation. Finally, we provide a library of poseestimation weights and behavioral predictive classifiers for resident-intruder behaviors in mice and rats. All code and data, together with detailed tutorials and documentation, are available on the SimBA GitHub repository. Graphical abstract SimBA graphical interface (GUI) for creating supervised machine learning classifiers of rodent social behavior. (a) Pre-process videos. SimBA supports common video pre-processing functions (e.g., cropping, clipping, sampling, format conversion, etc.) that can be performed either on single videos, or as a batch. (b) Managing poseestimation data and creating classification projects. Pose-estimation tracking projects in DeepLabCut and DeepPoseKit can be either imported or created and managed within the SimBA graphical user interface, and the tracking results are imported into SimBA classification projects. SimBA also supports userdrawn region-of-interests (ROIs) for descriptive statistics of animal movements, or as features in machine learning classification projects. (c) Create classifiers, perform classifications, and analyze classification data. SimBA has graphical tools for correcting poseestimation tracking inaccuracies when multiple subjects are within a single frame, annotating behavioral events from videos, and optimizing machine learning hyperparameters and discrimination thresholds. A number of validation checkpoints and logs are included for increased classifier explainability and tunability prior to, and during, experimental use. Both detailed and summary data are provided at the end of classifier analysis. SimBA accepts behavioral annotations generated elsewhere (such as through JWatcher) that can be imported into SimBA classification projects. (d) Visualize classification results. SimBA has several options for visualizing machine learning classifications, animal movements and ROI data, and analyzing the durations and frequencies of classified behaviors.

Existing mNGS data analysis tools typically require bioinformatics expertise and access to local server-class hardware resources. For many research laboratories, this presents an obstacle, especially in resource limited environments. Findings We present IDseq, an open source cloud-based metagenomics pipeline and service for global pathogen detection and monitoring (https://idseq.net). The IDseq Portal accepts raw mNGS data, performs host and quality filtration steps, then executes an assembly-based alignment pipeline which results in the assignment of reads and contigs to taxonomic categories. The taxonomic relative abundances are reported and visualized in an easy-to-use web application to facilitate data interpretation and hypothesis generation. Furthermore, IDseq supports environmental background model generation and automatic internal spike-in control recognition, providing statistics which are critical for data interpretation. IDseq was designed with the specific intent of detecting novel pathogens. Here, we benchmark novel virus detection capability using both synthetically evolved viral sequences, and real-world samples, including IDseq analysis of a nasopharyngeal swab sample acquired and processed locally in Cambodia from a tourist from Wuhan, China, infected with the recently emergent SARS-CoV-2.

Such database performance engineering is hard: a plethora of data and hardware-dependent optimization techniques form a design space that is difficult to navigate for a skilled engineer --- even more so for a query compiler. To facilitate performance-oriented design exploration and query plan compilation, we present Voodoo, a declarative intermediate algebra that abstracts the detailed architectural properties of the hardware, such as multi- or many-core architectures, caches and SIMD registers, without losing the ability to generate highly tuned code. Because it consists of a collection of declarative, vector-oriented operations, Voodoo is easier to reason about and tune than low-level C and related hardware-focused extensions (Intrinsics, OpenCL, CUDA, etc.). This enables our Voodoo compiler to produce (OpenCL) code that rivals and even outperforms the fastest state-of-the-art in memory databases for both GPUs and CPUs. In addition, Voodoo makes it possible to express techniques as diverse as cache-conscious processing, predication and vectorization (again on both GPUs and CPUs) with just a few lines of code. Central to our approach is a novel idea we termed control vectors, which allows a code generating frontend to expose parallelism to the Voodoo compiler in a abstract manner, enabling portable performance across hardware platforms.    We used Voodoo to build an alternative backend for MonetDB, a popular open-source in-memory database. Our backend allows MonetDB to perform at the same level as highly tuned in-memory databases, including HyPeR and Ocelot. We also demonstrate Voodoo's usefulness when investigating hardware conscious tuning techniques, assessing their performance on different queries, devices and data.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,755,,,

We envision these APIs to satisfy the networking needs of many programming models such as Message Passing Interface (MPI), OpenSHMEM, Partitioned Global Address Space (PGAS) languages, task-based paradigms and I/O bound applications. To evaluate the design we implement the APIs and protocols, and measure the performance of overhead-critical network primitives fundamental for implementing many parallel programming models and system libraries. Our results show that the latency, bandwidth, and message rate achieved by the portable UCX prototype is very close to that of the underlying driver. With UCX, we achieved a message exchange latency of 0.89 us, a bandwidth of 6138.5 MB/s, and a message rate of 14 million messages per second. As far as we know, this is the highest bandwidth and message rate achieved by any network stack (publicly known) on this hardware.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,760,,,

Recommendations for designing an ultra-reliable communications system for UAV swarms are introduced with a focus on the software protocol stack and RF hardware. For the purpose of demonstration, we developed Easy- Swarm, an open-source UAV swarming platform that adopts the LoRa radio at the physical layer and a low-latency channel access protocol at the MAC layer. Real-life testbeds are built consisting of 10 UAVs and 20 robotic cars that produce background traffic. LoRa, WiFi and LTE networks are employed to provide broadband and cellular wireless network support.

As a result, cloud service providers are expected to host an increasing number of microservices that can generate significant resource pressure on the cloud infrastructure. We want to understand the characteristics of microservice workloads to design an infrastructure optimized for microservices. In this paper, we used Acme Air, an open-source benchmark for Web services, and analyzed the behavior of two versions of the benchmark, microservice and monolithic, for two widely used language runtimes, Node.js and Java. We observed a significant overhead due to the microservice architecture; the performance of the microservice version can be 79.2% lower than the monolithic version on the same hardware configuration. On Node.js, the microservice version consumed 4.22 times more time in the libraries of Node.js than the monolithic version to process one user request. On Java, the microservice version also consumed more time in the application server than the monolithic version. We explain these performance differences from both hardware and software perspectives.

A serverless application is a set of stateless functions, along with the events that should trigger their activation. A serverless runtime allocates resources as events arrive, avoiding the need for costly pre-allocated or dedicated hardware. While an attractive economic proposition, serverless computing currently lags behind the state of the art when it comes to function composition. This paper addresses the challenge of programming a composition of functions, where the composition is itself a serverless function. We demonstrate that engineering function composition into a serverless application is possible, but requires a careful evaluation of trade-offs. To help in evaluating these trade-offs, we identify three competing constraints: functions should be considered as black boxes; function composition should obey a substitution principle with respect to synchronous invocation; and invocations should not be double-billed. Furthermore, we argue that, if the serverless runtime is limited to a reactive core, i.e. one that deals only with dispatching functions in response to events, then these constraints form the serverless trilemma. Without specific runtime support, compositions-as-functions must violate at least one of the three constraints. Finally, we demonstrate an extension to the reactive core of an open-source serverless runtime that enables the sequential composition of functions in a trilemma-satisfying way. We conjecture that this technique could be generalized to support other combinations of functions.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,770,,,

However, it has proved challenging to 3D print PDMS in complex structures due to its low elastic modulus and need for support during the printing process. Here we demonstrate the 3D printing of hydrophobic PDMS prepolymer resins within a hydrophilic Carbopol gel support via freeform reversible embedding (FRE). In the FRE printing process, the Carbopol support acts as a Bingham plastic that yields and fluidizes when the syringe tip of the 3D printer moves through it, but acts as a solid for the PDMS extruded within it. This, in combination with the immiscibility of hydrophobic PDMS in the hydrophilic Carbopol, confines the PDMS prepolymer within the support for curing times up to 72 h while maintaining dimensional stability. After printing and curing, the Carbopol support gel releases the embedded PDMS prints by using phosphate buffered saline solution to reduce the Carbopol yield stress. As proof-of-concept, we used Sylgard 184 PDMS to 3D print linear and helical filaments via continuous extrusion and cylindrical and helical tubes via layer-by-layer fabrication. Importantly, we show that the 3D printed tubes were manifold and perfusable. The results demonstrate that hydrophobic polymers with low viscosity and long cure times can be 3D printed using a hydrophilic support, expanding the range of biomaterials that can be used in additive manufacturing.

Owing to its differentiable property, DSQ can help pursue the accurate gradients in backward propagation, and reduce the quantization loss in forward process with an appropriate clipping range.

Microservices fundamentally change a lot of assumptions current cloud systems are designed with, and present both opportunities and challenges when optimizing for quality of service (QoS) and cloud utilization. In this paper we explore the implications microservices have across the cloud system stack. We first present DeathStarBench, a novel, open-source benchmark suite built with microservices that is representative of large end-to-end services, modular and extensible. DeathStarBench includes a social network, a media service, an e-commerce site, a banking system, and IoT applications for coordination control of UAV swarms. We then use DeathStarBench to study the architectural characteristics of microservices, their implications in networking and operating systems, their challenges with respect to cluster management, and their trade-offs in terms of application design and programming frameworks. Finally, we explore the tail at scale effects of microservices in real deployments with hundreds of users, and highlight the increased pressure they put on performance predictability.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,793,,,

Our system architecture is centered around a publish-subscribe object request broker on top of a POSIX application programming interface. This allows to reuse common Unix knowledge and experience, including a bash-like shell. We demonstrate with a vertical takeoff and landing (VTOL) use case that the system modularity is well suited for novel and experimental vehicle platforms. We also show how the system architecture allows a direct interface to ROS and to run individual processes either as native ROS nodes on Linux or nodes on the micro controller, maximizing interoperability.

Due to this, previous neural architecture search (NAS) methods are computationally expensive. ConvNet architecture optimality depends on factors such as input resolution and target devices. However, existing approaches are too resource demanding for case-by-case redesigns. Also, previous work focuses primarily on reducing FLOPs, but FLOP count does not always reflect actual latency. To address these, we propose a differentiable neural architecture search (DNAS) framework that uses gradient-based methods to optimize ConvNet architectures, avoiding enumerating and training individual architectures separately as in previous methods. FBNets (Facebook-Berkeley-Nets), a family of models discovered by DNAS surpass state-of-the-art models both designed manually and generated automatically. FBNet-B achieves 74.1% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet with 295M FLOPs and 23.1 ms latency on a Samsung S8 phone, 2.4x smaller and 1.5x faster than MobileNetV2-1.3 with similar accuracy. Despite higher accuracy and lower latency than MnasNet, we estimate FBNet-B's search cost is 420x smaller than MnasNet's, at only 216 GPU-hours. Searched for different resolutions and channel sizes, FBNets achieve 1.5% to 6.4% higher accuracy than MobileNetV2.

Manta is optimized for rapid germline and somatic analysis, calling structural variants, medium-sized indels and large insertions on standard compute hardware in less than a tenth of the time that comparable methods require to identify only subsets of these variant types: for example NA12878 at 50√ó genomic coverage is analyzed in less than 20‚Äâmin. Manta can discover and score variants based on supporting paired and split-read evidence, with scoring models optimized for germline analysis of diploid individuals and somatic analysis of tumor-normal sample pairs. Call quality is similar to or better than comparable methods, as determined by pedigree consistency of germline calls and comparison of somatic calls to COSMIC database variants. Manta consistently assembles a higher fraction of its calls to base-pair resolution, allowing for improved downstream annotation and analysis of clinical significance.

Thus, this protection becomes crucial with a typical Internet-of-Things (IoT) setup, as it usually involves several IoT-based data sources interacting with the physical world within various application domains, such as agriculture, health care, home automation, critical industrial processes, etc. Unfortunately, contemporary IoT devices often offer very limited security features, laying themselves open to always new and more sophisticated attacks and also inhibiting the expected global adoption of IoT technologies, not to mention millions of IoT devices already deployed without any hardware security support. In this context, it is crucial to develop tools able to detect such cyber threats. In this article, we present Passban, an intelligent intrusion detection system (IDS) able to protect the IoT devices that are directly connected to it. The peculiarity of the proposed solution is that it can be deployed directly on very cheap IoT gateways (e.g., single-board PCs currently costing few tens of U.S. dollars), hence taking full advantage of the edge computing paradigm to detect cyber threats as close as possible to the corresponding data sources.

Researchers report their findings, which are strengthened as other independent groups in the scientific community share similar outcomes. In the many scientific fields where software has become a fundamental tool for capturing and analyzing data, this requirement of reproducibility implies that reliable and comprehensive software platforms and tools should be made available to the scientific community. The tools will empower them and the public to verify, through practice, the reproducibility of observations that are reported in the scientific literature. Medical image analysis is one of the fields in which the use of computational resources, both software and hardware, are an essential platform for performing experimental work. In this arena, the introduction of the Insight Toolkit (ITK) in 1999 has transformed the field and facilitates its progress by accelerating the rate at which algorithmic implementations are developed, tested, disseminated and improved. By building on the efficiency and quality of open source methodologies, ITK has provided the medical image community with an effective platform on which to build a daily workflow that incorporates the true scientific practices of reproducibility verification.

Just as Software Defined Networking (SDN) research and product development was greatly accelerated with the release of several open source SDN platforms, we believe that Network Function Virtualization (NFV) research can see similar growth with the development of a flexible platform that enables high performance NFV prototypes. Towards this end we have been building OpenNetVM, an efficient packet processing framework that greatly simplifies the development of network functions, as well as research into their management and optimization. OpenNetVM runs network functions in lightweight Docker containers, enabling fast startup and reducing memory overheads. The OpenNetVM platform manager provides load balancing, flexible flow management, and service name abstractions.

The basic concept of SDN is the separation of control plane (network configuration) and data plane (forwarding). The control plane is implemented by a dedicated controller running on an external host. This controller implements the control logic like route calculation and topology discovery and configures the forwarding tables of switches accordingly; the switches are responsible for packet forwarding. The control logic is implemented in software using high-level programming languages like C, C++, Java, or Python and can be easily modified (software instead of firmware). Therefore, this concept combines flexibility and ease of implementation with high forwarding performance (line rate forwarding, low latency). With OpenFlow, a first standard protocol for SDN is available that is implemented by hardware switches from several vendors already and software switches like Open vSwitch as typically used in data centers to connect virtual machines on hosts. Moreover, several open source controller implementations exist.

In contrast to past capability models, CHERI complements, rather than replaces, the ubiquitous page-based protection mechanism, providing a migration path towards deconflating data-structure protection and OS memory management. Furthermore. CHERI adheres to a strict RISC philosophy: it maintains a load-store architecture and requires only single-cycle instructions, and supplies protection primitives to the compiler, language runtime, and operating system. We demonstrate a mature FPGA implementation that runs the FreeBSD operating system with a full range of software and an open-source application suite compiled with an extended LLVM to use CHERI memory protection.

Developments over the last decade in technology, open science, and the sharing economy promise to bring global access to more versatile and more affordable monitoring tools, to improve coverage for conservation researchers and managers. 2. Here we describe the development and proof-of-concept of a low-cost, small-sized and low-energy acoustic detector: ""AudioMoth."" The device is open-source and programmable, with diverse applications for recording animal calls or human activity at sample rates of up to 384 kHz. We briefly outline two ongoing real-world case studies of large-scale, long-term monitoring for biodiversity and exploitation of natural resources. These studies demonstrate the potential for AudioMoth to enable a substantial shift away from passive continuous recording by individual devices, towards smart detection by networks of devices flooding large and inaccessible ecosystems. 3. The case studies demonstrate one of the smart capabilities of AudioMoth, to trigger event logging on the basis of classification algorithms that identify specific acoustic events. An algorithm to trigger recordings of the New Forest cicada (Cicadetta montana) demonstrates the potential for AudioMoth to vastly improve the spatial and temporal coverage of surveys for the presence of cryptic animals. An algorithm for logging gunshot events has potential to identify a shotgun blast in tropical rainforest at distances of up to 500 m, extending to 1 km with continuous recording. 4. AudioMoth is more energy efficient than currently available passive acoustic monitoring devices, giving it considerably greater portability and longevity in the field with smaller batteries. At a build cost of similar to US$43 per unit, AudioMoth has potential for varied applications in large-scale, long-term acoustic surveys.

Tools and software needed to develop and debug trusted applications may be expensive or non-existent. In this paper, we describe Open-TEE, a virtual, hardware-independent TEE implemented in software. Open-TEE conforms to GP specifications. It allows developers to develop and debug trusted applications with the same tools they use for developing software in general. Once a trusted application is fully debugged, it can be compiled for any actual hardware TEE. Through performance measurements and a user study we demonstrate that Open-TEE is efficient and easy to use. We have made Open-TEE freely available as open source.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,847,,,

The wide-spread use of transport layer security (TLS) and the growing popularity of anonymity networks, such as Tor, exemplify this trend. Motivated by the recent movement towards commoditization of trusted execution environments (TEEs), this paper explores alternative design choices that application and protocol designers should consider. In particular, we explore the possibility of using Intel SGX to provide security and privacy in a wide range of network applications. We show that leveraging hardware protection of TEEs opens up new possibilities, often at the benefit of a much simplified application/protocol design. We demonstrate its practical implications by exploring the design space for SGX-enabled software-defined inter-domain routing, peer-to-peer anonymity networks (Tor), and middleboxes. Finally, we quantify the potential overheads of the SGX-enabled design by implementing it on top of OpenSGX, an open source SGX emulator.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,852,,,

However, existing neural networks that use 32 bits to encode each weight and activation often have an energy budget that far exceeds the capabilities of mobile or embedded devices. One common way to improve computational efficiency is to reduce the precision of the network to 16-bit or 8-bit, also known as quantization. Binarized Neural Networks (BNNs) represent an extreme case of quantized networks, that cannot be viewed as approximations to real-valued networks and therefore requires special tools and optimization strategies (Helwegen et al., 2019). In these networks both weights and activations are restricted to {‚àí1,+1} (Hubara, Courbariaux, Soudry, El-Yaniv, & Bengio, 2016). Compared to an equivalent 8-bit quantized network BNNs require 8 times smaller memory size and 8 times fewer memory accesses, which reduces energy consumption drastically when deployed on optimized hardware (Hubara et al., 2016). However, many open research questions remain until the use of BNNs and other extremely quantized neural networks becomes widespread in industry. larq is an ecosystem of Python packages for BNNs and other Quantized Neural Networks (QNNs).

Current noise mapping techniques often fail to accurately identify noise pollution sources, because they rely on the interpolation of a limited number of scattered sound sensors. Aiming to produce accurate noise pollution maps, we developed the SoundCompass, a low-cost sound sensor capable of measuring local noise levels and sound field directionality.

We have developed a fast and accurate method (known as ‚ÄúSET‚Äù) that is suitable even for natural environments with uncontrolled, dynamic and even extreme lighting conditions. We compared the performance of SET with that of two open-source alternatives by processing two collections of eye images: images of natural outdoor scenes with extreme lighting variations (‚ÄúNatural‚Äù); and images of less challenging indoor scenes (‚ÄúCASIA-Iris-Thousand‚Äù).

In this new design approach, the user defines every segment of the print-path along with all printing parameters, which may be related to geometric and non-geometric factors, at all points along the print-path. Machine control code (GCode) is directly generated by the software, without the need for any programming skills and without using computer-aided design (CAD), STL-files or slicing software. Excel is used as the front end for the software, which is written in Visual Basic. Case studies are used to demonstrate the broad range of structures that can be designed using the software, including: precisely controlled specimens for printer calibration, parametric specimens for hardware characterisation utilising hundreds of unique parameter combinations, novel mathematically defined lattice structures, and previously inconceivable 3D geometries that are impossible for traditional slicing software to achieve. The FullControl design approach enables unconstrained freedom to create nonplanar 3D print-paths and break free from traditional restrictions of layerwise print-path planning. It also allows nozzle movements to be carefully designed - both during extrusion and while travelling between disconnected extrusion volumes - to overcome inherent limitations of the printing process or to improve capabilities for challenging materials. An industrial case study shows how explicit print-path design improved printer reliability, production time, and print quality for a production run of over 1,000 parts. FullControl GCode Designer offers a general framework for unconstrained design and is not limited to a particular type of structure or hardware; transferability to lasers and other manufacturing processes is discussed. Parametric design files use a few bytes or kilobytes of data to describe all details that are sent to the printer, which greatly improves shareability by eliminating any risk of errors being introduced during STL file conversion or due to different users having inconsistent slicer settings. Adjustable parameters allow GCode for revised designs to be produced instantly, instead of the laborious traditional routine using multiple software packages and file conversions. The FullControl design concept offers new opportunities for creative and high-precision use of additive manufacturing systems. It facilitates design for additive manufacturing (DfAM) at the smallest possible scale based on the fundamental nature of the process (i.e. assembly of individual extrusions).

Aluminum oxide, boron nitride, and titanium nitride coatings were evaluated as possible substrate release agents for aluminum printing. Additionally, the in situ formation of substrate release agents such as intermetallics and oxides were tested for both aluminum and steel printing. Testing was performed with a modified Charpy impact tester to remove 3D printed metal parts from an 1100 aluminum or A36 low carbon steel print substrate to assess the impact energy required for removal. Specimen porosity was measured prior to sectioning and microstructural analysis, hardness traverses were measured across the specimens, and the elastic and shear moduli of the parts were analyzed via ultrasonic methods. All of the employed substrate release mechanisms minimized weld penetration and, in some instances, formed a brittle phase with the print substrate that allowed the specimens to be removed with minimal impact energy.

Because changes in the fluorescence intensity of genetically encoded or chemical calcium indicators correlate with action potential firing in neurons, data analysis is based on inferring such spiking from changes in pixel intensity values across time within different regions of interest. However, the algorithms necessary to extract biologically relevant information from these fluorescent signals are complex and require significant expertise in programming to develop robust analysis pipelines. For decades, the only way to perform these analyses was for individual laboratories to write their own custom code. These routines were typically not well annotated and lacked intuitive graphical user interfaces (GUIs), which made it difficult for scientists in other laboratories to adopt them. Although the panorama is changing with recent tools like CaImAn, Suite2P and others, there is still a barrier for many laboratories to adopt these packages, especially for potential users without sophisticated programming skills. As 2-photon microscopes are becoming increasingly affordable, the bottleneck is no longer the hardware, but the software used to analyze the calcium data in an optimal manner and consistently across different groups.

Computer systems employ a range of techniques to reduce overheads tied to data movement, spanning from traditional mechanisms (e.g., deep multi-level cache hierarch ies, aggressive hardware prefetcher s) to emerging techniques such as Near-Data Processing (NDP), where some computation is moved close to memory. Prior NDP works investigate the root causes of data movement bottlenecks using different profiling methodologies and tools. However, there is still a lack of understanding about the key metrics that can identify different data movement bottlenecks and their relation to traditional and emerging data movement mitigation mechanisms. Our goal is to methodically identify potential sources of data movement over a broad set of applications and to comprehensively compare traditional compute-centric data movement mitigation techniques (e.g., cach ing and prefetch ing) to more memory-centric techniques (e.g., NDP), thereby developing a rigorous understanding of the best techniques to mitigate each source of data movement.

Being SDR-based, the transceiver offers important benefits: It provides access to all data down to and including the physical layer, allowing for a better understanding of the system. Based on open and programmable hardware and software, the transceiver is completely transparent and all implementation details can be studied and, if needed, modified. Finally, it enables a seamless switch between simulations and experiments and, thus, helps to bridge the gap between theory and practice. Comparing the transceiver‚Äôs performance with independent results from simulations and experiments, we underline its potential to be used as a tool for further studies of IEEE 802.11p networks both in field operational tests as well as for simulation-based development of novel physical layer solutions.

The three-level dual-inverter requires a low PV bus voltage compared with its conventional three-level counterpart. This could avoid large string of PV modules and helps in reducing the voltage rating of the capacitors and semiconductor devices used in the system. This may further help in reduction of cost of the system. The proposed single-stage system is operated using an integrated control algorithm, which includes the maximum power point tracking (MPPT), the V/f control, and the sample-averaged zero-sequence elimination (SAZE) pulsewidth modulation (PWM) technique. While the MPPT algorithm ensures the extraction of maximum power from the PV source, the V/f control improves the motor pump performance. Furthermore, the zero-sequence current is avoided by the SAZE PWM algorithm. Thus, the integrated control algorithm improves the overall performance of the system. Furthermore, this paper also presents the details of system design and analysis of its dynamic behavior during transient environmental conditions.

However, printed parts are typically plastic and often perform poorly compared to traditionally machined mechanisms. We have overcome many of the limitations of 3D printed mechanisms by exploiting the compliance of the plastic to produce a monolithic 3D printed flexure translation stage, capable of sub-micron-scale motion over a range of 8 √ó 8 √ó 4 mm. This requires minimal post-print clean-up and can be automated with readily available stepper motors. The resulting plastic composite structure is very stiff and exhibits remarkably low drift, moving less than 20‚ÄâŒºm over the course of a week, without temperature stabilisation. This enables us to construct a miniature microscope with excellent mechanical stability, perfect for time-lapse measurements in situ in an incubator or fume hood. The ease of manufacture lends itself to use in containment facilities where disposability is advantageous and to experiments requiring many microscopes in parallel. High performance mechanisms based on printed flexures need not be limited to microscopy, and we anticipate their use in other devices both within the laboratory and beyond.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,917,,,

The prominent Meltdown and Spectre attacks abruptly revealed fundamental design flaws in CPU pipeline behavior and exception handling logic, urging the research community to systematically study attack surface from microarchitectural interactions. We present Nemesis, a previously overlooked side-channel attack vector that abuses the CPU's interrupt mechanism to leak microarchitectural instruction timings from enclaved execution environments such as Intel SGX, Sancus, and TrustLite. At its core, Nemesis abuses the same subtle microarchitectural behavior that enables Meltdown, i.e., exceptions and interrupts are delayed until instruction retirement. We show that by measuring the latency of a carefully timed interrupt, an attacker controlling the system software is able to infer instruction-granular execution state from hardware-enforced enclaves. In contrast to speculative execution vulnerabilities, our novel attack vector is applicable to the whole computing spectrum, from small embedded sensor nodes to high-end commodity x86 hardware. We present practical interrupt timing attacks against the open-source Sancus embedded research processor, and we show that interrupt latency reveals microarchitectural instruction timings from off-the-shelf Intel SGX enclaves.

We propose to achieve ASIC design obfuscation based on embedded reconfigurable logic which is determined by the end user and unknown to any party in the supply chain. Combined with other security techniques, embedded reconfigurable logic can provide the root of ASIC design obfuscation, data confidentiality and tamper-proofness. As a case study, we evaluate hardware-based code injection attacks and reconfiguration-based instruction set obfuscation based on an open source SPARC processor LEON2. We prevent program monitor Trojan attacks and increase the area of a minimum code injection Trojan with a 1KB ROM by 2.38% for every 1% area increase of the LEON2 processor.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,938,,,

In this paper, we present OWL, an Online Watcher for LTE that is able to decode all the resource blocks in more than 99% of the system frames, significantly outperforming existing non-commercial prior decoders. Compared to previous attempts, OWL grounds the decoding procedure on information obtained from the LTE random access mechanism.

To solve this problem, we present Phenotiki, an affordable system for plant phenotyping that, relying on off-the-shelf parts, provides an easy to install and maintain platform, offering an out-of-box experience for a well-established phenotyping need: imaging rosette-shaped plants. The accompanying software (with available source code) processes data originating from our device seamlessly and automatically. Our software relies on machine learning to devise robust algorithms, and includes an automated leaf count obtained from 2D images without the need of depth (3D). Our affordable device (~‚Ç¨200) can be deployed in growth chambers or greenhouse to acquire optical 2D images of approximately up to 60 adult Arabidopsis rosettes concurrently. Data from the device are processed remotely on a workstation or via a cloud application (based on CyVerse).

Phenotypic analysis with respect to morphology, growth, color and leaf count has not been performed comprehensively before now. We confirm the findings of others on some of the extracted traits, showing that we can phenotype at reduced cost. We also perform extensive validations with external measurements and with higher fidelity equipment, and find no loss in statistical accuracy when we use the affordable setting that we propose.

Despite such rapid development of TEE, software technologies for TEE significantly lag behind their hardware counterpart, and currently only a select group of researchers have the privilege of accessing this technology. To address this problem, we develop an open source platform, called OpenSGX, that emulates Intel SGX hardware components at the instruction level and provides new system software components necessarily required for full TEE exploration. We expect that the OpenSGX framework can serve as an open platform for SGX research, with the following contributions. First, we develop a fully functional, instruction-compatible emulator of Intel SGX for enabling the exploration of software/hardware design space, and development of enclave programs. OpenSGX provides a platform for SGX development, meaning that it provides not just emulation but also operating system components, an enclave program loader/packager, an OpenSGX user library, debugging, and performance monitoring. Second, to show OpenSGX‚Äôs use cases, we applied OpenSGX to protect sensitive information (e.g., directory) of Tor nodes and evaluated their potential performance impacts.

SCADA provides real-time data exchange between a control/monitoring centre and field devices connected to the distributed processes. A SCADA system performs these functions using its four basic elements: Field Instrumentation Devices (FIDs) such as sensors and actuators which are connected to the distributed process plants being managed, Remote Terminal Units (RTUs) such as single board computers for receiving, processing and sending the remote data from the field instrumentation devices, Master Terminal Units (MTUs) for handling data processing and human machine interactions, and lastly SCADA Communication Channels for connecting the RTUs to the MTUs, and for parsing the acquired data. Generally, there are two classes of SCADA hardware and software; Proprietary (Commercial) and Open Source. In this paper, we present the design and implementation of a low-cost, Open Source SCADA system by using Thinger.IO local server IoT platform as the MTU and ESP32 Thing micro-controller as the RTU. SCADA architectures have evolved over the years from monolithic (stand-alone) through distributed and networked architectures to the latest Internet of Things (IoT) architecture. The SCADA system proposed in this work is based on the Internet of Things SCADA architecture which incorporates web services with the conventional (traditional) SCADA for a more robust supervisory control and monitoring. It comprises of analog Current and Voltage Sensors, the low-power ESP32 Thing micro-controller, a Raspberry Pi micro-controller, and a local Wi-Fi Router. In its implementation, the current and voltage sensors acquire the desired data from the process plant, the ESP32 micro-controller receives, processes and sends the acquired sensor data via a Wi-Fi network to the Thinger.IO local server IoT platform for data storage, real-time monitoring and remote control. The Thinger.IO server is locally hosted by the Raspberry Pi micro-controller, while the Wi-Fi network which forms the SCADA communication channel is created using the Wi-Fi Router. In order to test the proposed SCADA system solution, the designed hardware was set up to remotely monitor the Photovoltaic (PV) voltage, current, and power, as well as the storage battery voltage of a 260 W, 12 V Solar PV System.

Hydractinia symbiolongicarpus is an emerging model organism in which cutting-edge genomic tools and resources are being developed for use in a growing number of research fields. One limitation of this model system is the lack of long-term storage for genetic resources. The goal of this study was to establish a generalizable cryopreservation approach for Hydractinia that would support future repository development for other cnidarian species. Specific objectives were to: (1) characterize basic parameters related to sperm quality; (2) develop a generalizable approach for sperm collection; (3) assess the feasibility of in vitro fertilization (IVF) with sperm after refrigerated storage; (4) assess the feasibility of IVF with sperm cryopreserved with various sperm concentrations; (5) evaluate feasibility of cryopreservation with various freezing conditions, and (6) explore the feasibility of cryopreservation by use of a 3-D printed open-hardware (CryoKit) device. Animal husbandry and sperm collection were facilitated by use of 3-D printed open hardware. Hydractinia sperm at a concentration of 2 x 10(7) cells/mL stored at 4 degrees C for 6 d were able to achieve 50% fertilization rate. It appeared that relatively higher sperm concentration (>5 x 10(7) cells/mL) for cryopreservation could promote fertilization.

From the case study, conducted on a home lettuce crop, it is concluded that the selected tools allow capturing, monitoring, and analyzing climatological variables of interest in urban agriculture crops. Likewise, it is concluded that the studied analysis models can be customized by considering the agroclimatic characteristics of each crop and that they are useful for decision-making related to crop physiology.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,975,,,

This requires that the R-wave must be detected reliably even in the presence of rapidly switching gradients, and that data previously acquired that were corrupted by respiratory motion reacquired. The accurately maintained steady-state magnetisation leads to an improvement in image quality and removes alterations in intensity that may otherwise occur throughout the cardiac cycle and impact upon automated image analysis.

In order to monitor soil salinization in plant physiological experiments, a salinity monitoring system - SProb - was produced to improve our understanding of plant responses to salinity, using open hardware Arduino platform. An experiment was performed and designed to calibrate and check the viability and accuracy of SProb to be used in scientific researches. Salt concentrations were manipulated to identify sensor ability in determining salt accumulation or leaching in soils. Also, two mangrove plant species were grown to identify if root presence would affect soil salt measurements. The soil osmotic potential (psi(s)) was estimated from SProb results and correlated with predawn and midday leaf water potential (psi(l)) of the mangrove plants, to identify if psi(s) would affect plants water regulations. It was also shown that SProb described well the soil salt accumulation or leaching along the time, and the measurements were not affected by the presence of roots. The ranges of psi(s) matched with the range of mangrove psi(l), and the psi(l) decreased with the decrease in psi(s) (increase in salinity). It was confirmed that the SProb sensor is efficient, cheap and has enough accuracy to monitor soil salt concentration.

Mechanosensitive ion channels (MSCs), especially ones of Piezo family (Piezo1 and Piezo2), play a crucial role in mechanotransduction. These transmembrane proteins directly react to mechanical cues by triggering the onset of an ionic current. The relevance of this mechanism in driving physiology and pathology is emerging, and there is a growing need for the identification of an affordable and reliable assay to measure it. Setting up a mechanosensitivity assay requires exerting a mechanical stimulus on single cells while observing the downstream effects of channels opening. We propose an open-hardware approach to stimulate single adherent cells through controlled microindentation, using a 3D-printed actuation platform. We validated the device by measuring the mechanosensitivity of a neural mice cell line where the expression level and activity of Piezo1 were genetically and pharmacologically manipulated.

To this end, it provides an easily usable task-based programming abstraction, and combines this with powerful tool support to automatically implement the individual hardware accelerators and integrate them into usable system-on-chips. Currently, TaPaSCo relies on the host to manage task parallelism and perform the actual task launches. However, for more expressive parallel programming patterns, such as pipelines of task farms, the round trips from the hardware accelerators back to the host for launching child tasks, especially when exploiting data-dependent execution times, quickly add up. The major contribution of this work is the addition of on-chip task scheduling and launching capabilities to TaPaSCo. This enables not only low-latency dynamic task parallelism, it also encompasses the efficient on-chip exchange of parameter values and task results between parent and child accelerator tasks. For larger distributed systems, the dynamic launch capability can even be extended over the network to span multiple FPGAs.

This approach enables the remote acquisition of information on Lagrangian transport and important ocean variables, similar to standard drifters.

Ball milling advantages include the potential for high capacity, pre-dicted fineness in a specific amount of time, reliability, safety, and simplicity, but has dis-advantages of high weight, energy consumption and costs, which limit accessibility. To overcome these limitations this study applies the free and open source hardware approach coupled to distributed digital manufacturing to fabricate a ball mill with a simple, cus-tomizable design that can be used in a wide range of scientific applications and circum-stances including those without access to reliable grid electricity. The highly -customizable design reduces the cost to 130 for an AC powered version and 315 for a switchable power that enables off-grid operation with a solar module and bat-tery. Using a solar photovoltaic energy source not only improves the power reliability, but also makes it easier to move the ball mill for use in field environments. The open source ball mill is capable of reducing silicon particle sizes from the millimeter scale down to the nanometer scale.& COPY; 2023 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Ltd.

A typical way to measure marine microplastic pollution involves imaging filtered seawater samples stained with a fluorescent dye to aid in the detection of microplastics. Although traditional fluorescence microscopy allows these particles to be manually counted and detected, this is a resource- and labour-intensive task. Here, we describe a novel, low-cost microscope for automated scanning and detection of microplastics in filtered seawater samples-the EnderScope. This microscope is based on the mechanics of a low-cost 3D printer (Creality Ender 3). The hotend of the printer is replaced with an optics module, allowing for the reliable and calibrated motion system of the 3D printer to be used for automated scanning over a large area (>20 x 20 cm). The EnderScope is capable of both reflected light and fluorescence imaging. In both configurations, we aimed to make the design as simple and cost-effective as possible, for example, by using low-cost LEDs for illumination and lighting gels as emission filters. We believe this tool is a cost-effective solution for microplastic measurement.

The regression models developed by re-searchers to predict physicochemical attributes using spectra remain theoretical due to lack of mechanism to integrate the developed models back into proprietary devices. This poses challenge for commercial adaptation of this technology in commercial food quality supply chain. The present study addresses this research gap by presenting first of its kind innovative approach to classify tomatoes based on lycopene content using chemometrics-machine learning framework driven portable short-wave near infra-red (SWNIR) spectropho-tometer developed by integration of open-source hardware (AS7265x multispectral chipset having wavelength range 410-940 nanometre (nm), Arduino Uno microcontroller) and software (R platform), housed in ergo-nomically designed and 3-dimension printed cabinet ensuring noise-free spectra acquisition. The lycopene content was observed to have strong negative correlation with wavelengths (nm) 485, 560 and 585 at rho = - 0.65, - 0.70, - 0.70, whereas strong positive correlation with 760 nm at rho = +0.64. Similar associations were qual-itatively observed using principal component analysis. Atypical of literature, feature selection was performed based on analysis of variance and 14 wavelengths which exhibited statistically significant difference with respect to 15-days storage study (p <= 0.05) were selected for model development. Chemometrics-machine learning framework was used for development of optimised probabilistic and non-probabilistic models including logistic regression, Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), Random Forest (RF), Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) models using 10-fold cross validation subjected to 80-20% train-test split of the dataset. In agreement with literature, 500-750 nm wavelength range dominated the classification of lycopene content. Notably, specific wavelengths for logistic regression (560 nm), LDA (730 nm, 645 nm, 560 nm, 535 nm), RF (760 nm, 585 nm, 560 nm, 645 nm), and ANN (585 nm, 560 nm) significantly influenced outcome instances across classifiers. Accuracy obtained from confusion matrix on test dataset was used as performance metric to compare different models. Logistic regression and RF showcased accuracy of 80%, LDA and SVM at 90% while ANN outperformed all models with accuracy of 95%. This study successfully augmented technological advancement in field of spectroscopy for non-invasive quality assessment of fruit.

Recently, due to the rise of the open-hardware revolution and the associated Arduino ecosystem, both GPS receivers and cellular modems have become available at lower prices to ""tinkering scientists"", i.e., scientists that like to build their own measurement devices as much as is possible. This article serves two goals. Firstly, we provide detailed instructions on how to build a low-power GPS drifter with local storage and cellular model that we tested in a fieldwork on the confluence of the Chindwin and Ayeyarwady rivers in Myanmar. The device was designed from easily connected off-the-shelf components, allowing construction without a background in electrical engineering. The instructions allow fellow geoscientists to recreate the device. Secondly, we set the following question: has the open-hardware revolution progressed to the point that a low-power GPS drifter that wirelessly transmits its position can be made from open-hardware components by most geoscientists?. We feel this question is relevant and timely as more low-cost open-hardware devices are promoted, but in practice applicability is often restricted to the ""tinkering engineer"". We argue that because of the plug-and-play nature of the components geoscientists should be able to construct these type of devices. However, to get such devices to operate at low power levels that fieldwork often demands requires detailed (micro)electrical expertise.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,1035,,,

Usually this is achieved by SCADA systems. But SCADA systems are technically complex and expensive. They are often not affordable for small water utilities. Their systems are operated with a very low level of automatization and monitoring causing inefficient operation, water loss or even interruption of service. The Internet of Things concept is very promising to realize a cost-effective tool for monitoring and control of water systems. The potential of this approach is investigated in the research project IoT.H2O funded in the WaterJPI call IC4WATER. In the paper, the concept of the IoT system for monitoring and control of water supply systems is explained. Special gateways and IoT devices have been developed which communicate with the IoT platform by the LoRaWAN network protocol or WiFi. It is shown how a pump test rig can be controlled with these devices. Also, results of field installations in a water distribution system in Germany are presented. Moreover, it is shown how data from existing SCADA systems and results from network simulations with EPANET can be included in the IoT system and how the data can be processed and evaluated by the IoT platform. By combining the data of different systems, the developed IoT system provides the user a cost-effective tool for monitoring and control of a water system.",http://ocs.editorial.upv.es/index.php/WDSA-CCWI/WDSA-CCWI2022/paper/viewFile/14788/8437,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,1065,,,

Samples were instrumentally processed in a relatively short time, and neither an intentional reduction of the linear flow rate nor an unconventional fluorescence instrument were required. Through the inclusion of external circuitry based on open-source hardware, the occurrence time of each individual fluorescence intensity reading was recorded. For the reported instrumental setup, irregular signal sampling was verified. In order to consider samples-specific time measurements, the PARAFAC (Parallel Factor Analysis) algorithm, and the derived APARAFAC (Augmented-PARAFAC) strategy, were adapted. The functional information was employed during the computational stages, through the development and implementation of smoothing strategies. To tackle differences between the rate of spectral acquisition and the rate of change in the concentration of the mobile fluorophores, Expectation Maximization was implemented. Data from samples with one calibrated analyze (Vitamin B6-Pyridoxine), in presence of uncalibrated interferents, were modeled. In order to preserve the original data structure, unfolding data operations were minimized. The resolved profiles of all species were in agreement with the corresponding chromatographic and spectral references. Results suggest that the effects derived from the loss of trilinearity previously reported in the literature for LC-EEM data, depend on interpretation and subsequent modeling of the data. The reported strategies can be useful with other flow techniques and kinetics.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,1071,,,

There are several types of anemometers, with medium and high costs, such as cup, hot wire and pitot tubes, the hot wire being more sensitive and expensive than others. The device developed in this work is the cup anemometer, that is easy to build. The great advantage of this device is the low cost, with an approximate value of US$ 50.00, using simple materials that are easy to find in commercial stores. The Reed Switch sensor is also another advantage as it does not require a sophisticated programming, as well as the open platform Arduino. The use of theoretical aerodynamic drag coefficients and the presented calculations resulted in values very close to a commercial anemometer. The coefficient of determination between the cup Anemometer and the standard sensor of Meteorological Research Institute IPMet/Brazil is R-2=0.9999, indicating strong correlation between the instruments. As the reference anemometer (IPMet) has high embedded technology and the prototype is low cost, we conclude that the project has an attractive cost benefit for possible development and production, reaching the objective of this work.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,1086,,,

There is an open area to develop and to build didactic modules to improve the learning process using experimentation in real physical systems. Particularly, a cart inverted pendulum is a classical physical system very commonly used in recent decades. We propose a cart inverted pendulum named MoDiCA-X as a low-cost didactic module with open source hardware and software. It is an electromechanical system feasible to build and easy to be modified. The mechanical parts of the module are 3D printed solids and can also be easily replicated. In terms of programming, the control applied to the system can be modified, since it uses C/C++ programming languages that are widely used in the academic community. The module is equipped with two very commercial sensors, are easy to install and to remove; both acquire the pendulum attitude and the car position. The actuators are four electric DC motors coupled to the car wheels to provide suitable velocity and torque to each axle independently. We validate the performance of the module by applying a multivariable linear quadratic regulator algorithm (LQR). (C) 2020 The Authors.

However, commercially available devices are unaffordable to most potential users in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), limiting access to many patients who could benefit from this treatment. This study aimed to design and test a cheap and easy-to-build negative pressure device and provide its detailed open-source description, thereby enabling free replication. Methods: the negative pressure device was built using off-the-shelf materials available via e-commerce and was based on a small pump, a pressure transducer, and the simplest Arduino controller with a digital display (total retail cost <= 75 US$). The device allows the user to set any therapeutic range of intermittent negative pressure and has two independent safety mechanisms. The performance of the low-cost device was carefully tested on the bench using a phantom wound, producing a realistic exudate flow rate. Results: the device generates the pressure patterns set by the user (25-175 mmHg of vacuum pressure, 0-60 min periods) and can drain exudate flows within the clinical range (up to 1 L/h). Conclusions: a novel, low-cost, easy-to-build negative pressure device for wound healing displays excellent technical performance.

Microalgae cultivation techniques have evolved and improved, but a vast amount of research is still needed to achieve a better understanding of these microorganisms. Due to this, there is a growing need for affordable, flexible, and easy to control research systems and protocols. 3D printing revolutionized design and manufacturing as it became widely available to the mass market, allowing the creation of novel forms, enabling mass customization, and supporting low-volume, distributed production. The emergence of open source designs combined with 3D printing applications have the potential to replace and outperform standard designs and methods. This protocol describes CultureLED, a well plated cell culture system that can be mounted on an orbital shaker or positioned on a shelf. It is an open hardware design, based on low-cost commercial off-the-shelf components. It was designed for optimized production cost, simplicity, low power consumption, design flexibility, and controllable light conditions. The CultureLED utilizes light-emitting diodes and it can be used for cultivation of small sized organisms or microorganisms with different light requirements and as such, has a wide range of applications.(c) 2022 The Authors.

The traditional, design-limiting periodicity in material design is overcome by utilizing Wang tiles to achieve compatibility among building blocks. We illustrate our approach with the design and manufacturing of an L-shaped domain inspired by a scissor-like soft gripper, whose internal module distribution was optimized to achieve an extreme tilt of a tip of the gripper's jaw when the handle part was uniformly compressed. The geometry of individual modules was built on a 3 x 3 grid of elliptical holes with varying semi-axes ratios and alternating orientations. We optimized the distribution of the modules within the L-shaped domain using an enumeration approach combined with a factorial search strategy. To address the challenge of seamless interface connections in modular manufacturing, we produced the final designs by casting silicone rubber into modular molds automatically assembled by a robotic arm. The predicted performance was validated experimentally using a custom-built, open-hardware test rig, Thymos, supplemented with digital image correlation measurements. Our study demonstrates the potential for enhancing the mechanical performance of architectured materials by incorporating nonuniform modular designs and efficient robot-assisted manufacturing.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,1141,,,

However, the systems for detecting the fluorophores remain expensive and thus inaccessible to many. Most commercial systems are often only optimized for one specific application, making reuse difficult. This paper demonstrates, characterizes and evaluates an inexpensive and versatile system for the detection of fluorophores with two wavelengths using high power LEDs. The LEDs are arranged in two banks angled downward at a tray in a way that allows for bright and uniform illumination while preventing direct reflections into the camera. The emitted light is filtered through an exchangeable filter frame and can be detected using the camera of a smartphone or similar device. By using filters both in front of the LEDs and the camera, very low background and using sufficient exposure times, very high sensitivity can be achieved. The two wavelengths of excitation light and the exchangeable filters allow for optimization for the specific fluorophore used and thus highest brightness.& COPY; 2023 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

In this sense, the do-it-yourself (DIY) approach to build new low-cost systems or verify the correspondence of low-cost systems compared to professional devices allows the spread of application possibilities. Following this trend, the authors aim to present a complete DIY and replicable procedure to evaluate the performance of a low-cost video luminance meter consisting of a Raspberry Pi and a camera module. The method initially consists of designing and developing a LED panel and a light cube that serves as reference illuminance sources. The luminance distribution along the two reference light sources is determined using a Konica Minolta luminance meter. With this approach, it is possible to identify an area for each light source with an almost equal luminance value. By applying a frame that covers part of the panel and shows only the area with nearly homogeneous luminance values and applying the two systems in a dark space in front of the low-cost video luminance meter mounted on a professional reference camera photometer LMK mobile air, it is possible to check the discrepancy in luminance values between the low-cost and professional systems when pointing different homogeneous light sources. In doing so, we primarily consider the peripheral shading effect, better known as the vignetting effect. We then differentiate the correction factor S of the Radiance Pcomb function to better match the luminance values of the low-cost system to the professional device. We also introduce an algorithm to differentiate the S factor depending on the light source. In general, the DIY calibration process described in the paper is time-consuming. However, the subsequent applications in various real-life scenarios allow us to verify the satisfactory performance of the low-cost system in terms of luminance mapping and glare evaluation compared to a professional device.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,1147,,,

First, we present the MiSDIREKt (Multi-Session Dynamic Interaction Recordings of EMG and Kinematics) dataset acquired using a novel hardware design. A single participant performed four kinds of hand interaction tasks in virtual reality for 43 distinct sessions over 12 days, totaling 814 min. Second, we analyze this data using a non-linear encoder-decoder for dimensionality reduction in gesture classification. We find that an architecture which recalibrates with a small amount of single session data performs at an accuracy of 79.5% on that session, as opposed to architectures which learn solely from the single session (49.6%) or learn only from the training data (55.2%).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,1185,,,

This paper presents our user-friendly and open-source web-based digital design tool, SHDL, which is used to describe and simulate hardware components and translate them into a standard language. SHDL is a teaching language and tool for digital design, which aims to improve the teaching and learning experience in digital systems design courses. The use and evaluation of the proposed online teaching model for the Digital Electronic Systems Design (DESD) course, using the SHDL tool for e-learning during the COVID-19 phase, is presented. Using the SHDL language and web tool, we have created many examples of digital circuits that prepare students to explore their own designs. The example components can also be used as digital system modules, leading to better modularity of the final project. The use of SHDL in the DESD course has shown that the proposed language leads to fewer syntax, simulation and synthesis errors in the designed circuits.

In the fields of materials science and mechanical engineering, fundamental equipment such as tensile testing devices can cost tens to hundreds of thousands of dollars. While a research lab often has access to a large-scale testing machine suitable for conventional samples, loading devices for meso-and micro-scale samples for in-situ testing with the myriad of microscopy tools are often hard to source and cost prohibitive. Open-source software has allowed for great strides in the reduction of costs associated with software development and open-source hardware and additive manufacturing have the potential to similarly reduce the costs of scientific equipment and increase the accessibility of scientific research. To investigate the feasibility of open-source hardware, a micro-tensile tester was designed with a freely accessible computer-aided design package and manufactured with a desktop 3D-printer and off-the-shelf components. To our knowledge this is one of the first demonstrations of a tensile tester with additively manufactured components for scientific research. The capabilities of the tensile tester were demonstrated by investigating the mechanical properties of Graphene Oxide (GO) paper and thin films. A 3D printed tensile tester was successfully used in conjunction with an atomic force microscope to provide one of the first quantitative measurements of GO thin film buckling under compression. The tensile tester was also used in conjunction with an atomic force microscope to observe the change in surface topology of a GO paper in response to increasing tensile strain. No significant change in surface topology was observed in contrast to prior hypotheses from the literature. Based on this result obtained with the new open source tensile stage we propose an alternative hypothesis we term 'superlamellae consolidation' to explain the initial deformation of GO paper. The additively manufactured tensile tester tested represents cost savings of > 99% compared to commercial solutions in its class and offers simple customization. However, continued development is needed for the tensile tester presented here to approach the technical specifications achievable with commercial solutions.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,1229,,,

Increased specimen thickness degrades resolution with beam broadening alongside loss of contrast. The large inelastic cross-section of carbon hampers accurate atomic species detection. Oxygen and water molecules pose problems of lattice damage by chemically etching the specimen during imaging. These constraints on high-resolution and spectroscopic imaging demand clean, high-vacuum microscopes with dry pumps. Here, we present an open-hardware design of a high-vacuum manifold for transmission electron microscopy (TEM) holders to mitigate hydrocarbon and residual species exposure. We quantitatively show that TEM holders are inherently dirty and introduce a range of unwanted chemical species. Overnight storage in our manifold reduces contaminants by one to two orders of magnitude and promotes two to four times faster vacuum recovery. A built-in bakeout system further reduces contaminants partial pressure to below 10(-10 )hPa (Torr) (approximately four orders of magnitude down from ambient storage) and alleviates monolayer adsorption during a typical TEM experiment.

A small-scale autonomous pontoon boat has been built, equipped with the open-hardware flight controller, GPS receiver, Inertial Measurement Units (IMU) and the magnetometer. A 2(3) factorial design based on Design of Experiment (DOE) is carried out to study the influence of three parameters (turn_rate, turn_angle and damping) on the response variable (peak-to-peak deviation from the desired trajectory). Total 24 experiments have been conducted by setting the desired trajectory as a circle with diameter 20 m. The peak-to-peak deviation in each experiment has been observed. The analyses revealed that the damping has low interaction with the turn angle and turn rate while there is a stronger interaction between the turn angle and turn rate. And the peak-to-peak deviation of the trajectory tends to decrease when the parameter damping was set to high value. The regression model has been derived and plotted as a response surface. The optimized parameters were selected from the plot and perform the experiment with three replications. The results confirm that parameters tuning has improved the performance of the boat significantly. With the DOE approach, the impact of two or more parameters on a response, the interaction between parameters can be investigated systematically.

One way of achieving synchronization involves marking distinct events with electrical pulses (event markers or ""TTL pulses""), which are continuously recorded with research hardware, and can later be temporally aligned. Traditionally, this event marking was often performed using the parallel port in standard personal computers. However, the parallel port is disappearing from the landscape of computer hardware, being replaced by a serial (COM) port, namely the USB port. To find an adequate replacement for the parallel port, we evaluated four microcontroller units (MCUs) and the LabJack U3, an often-used USB data acquisition device, in terms of their latency and jitter for sending event markers in a simulated experiment on both Windows and Linux. Our results show that all four MCUs were comparable to the parallel port in terms of both latency and jitter, and consistently achieved latencies under 1 ms. With some caveats, the LabJack U3 can also achieve comparable latencies. In addition to the collected data, we share extensive documentation on how to build and use MCUs for event marking, including code examples.

The present generation of systems designed for underwater communications relies mostly on acoustic waves, typically in the ultrasonic frequency range. In this work, we develop and evaluate a means of implementing underwater acoustic channel-based severely constrained IoT networks using low-cost, off-the-shelf, open hardware electronics and transducers, which can support direct communication between two nodes at a data rate of 2.4 kbps for over 65 m. These nodes can be deployed over much longer distances through multihop relay topologies. Furthermore, we evaluate the efficacy of our system toward supporting multimedia data transmission and even attempt multimedia streaming through our deployed underwater IoT network using video compression and reduced sampling of the video frames. We observe that the system successfully supports multihop network topologies and undertakes multimedia transmission by compromising the quality of the data. The system has a clear tradeoff between data quality, transmission range, and transmission delays.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,1240,,,

These stations form a seismic network consisting of various types of instrumentation, and communication systems. Over a period of 11 years, the Centre has embarked on an initiative of upgrading and expanding the current network with combinations of broadband and/or strong motion sensors, high dynamic range digitizers and networking equipment to link each station to centralized observatories via high speed digital data transmission medium. To realize such an upgrade and expansion, the Centre has developed a seismic data acquisition system prototype built using open-source hardware and software tools. The prototype is intended to be low-cost using off the shelf hardware components and open-source seismic related software handling data acquisition and data processing in two separate modules. The prototype uses a three-channel accelerometer sensor and can process data into standard MiniSEED format for easy data archiving and seismic data analysis. A global position module provides network time protocol time synchronization within 1 millisecond for accurate timestamping of data. Data can be stored locally on the prototype in twenty-minute data files or securely transferred to a central location via internet with the use of virtual private network capabilities. The prototype is modular in design allowing for components to be replaced easily and the system software can be updated remotely thus reducing maintenance cost.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,1250,,,

For instance, the different sampling rates and the different noise levels frequently found in the available signal databases can cause severe incompatibility problems when the integration of different algorithms is desired. Therefore, this work aims to solve this incompatibility problem by providing the academic community with a diagnostic-grade electrocardiograph. The intention is to create a new standardized ECG signals database in order to address the automatic interpretation problem and create an electrocardiography system that can fully assist clinical practitioners, as the proprietary systems do. Achieving this objective is expected through an open and coordinated collaboration platform for which a webpage has already been created.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,1283,,,

The availability of reduced-pressure ion mobility systems remains limited due to comparatively expensive commercial options and limited shared design features in the open literature. This report details the complete design and benchmarking characteristics of a reduced-pressure ion mobility system. The system is constructed from FR4 PCB electrodes and encased in a PTFE vacuum enclosure with custom torque-tightened couplers to utilize standard KF40 bulkheads. The PTFE enclosure directly minimizes the overall system expenses, and the implementation of threaded brass inserts allows for facile attachments to the vacuum enclosure without damaging the thermoplastic housing. Front and rear ion funnels maximize ion transmission and help mitigate the effects of radial ion diffusion. A custom planar ion shuttle transports ions from the exit of the rear ion funnel into the ion optics of an ion trap mass analyzer. The planar ion shuttle can couple the IM system to any contemporary Thermo Scientific ion trap mass analyzer. Signal stability and ion intensity remain unchanging following the implementation of the planar ion shuttle when compared to the original stacked ring ion guide. The constructed IM system showed resolving powers up to 85 for various small molecules and proteins using the Fourier transform from a similar to 1 m drift tube. Recorded mobilities derived from first principles agree with published literature results with an average error of 1.1% and an average error toward literature values using single field calibration of <1.3%.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,1284,,,

However, applying such stimuli simultaneously is difficult in practice. We aimed to design, build, test, and open-source describe a simple device that subjects a conventional mouse cage to independent cycles of physiologically relevant environmental variables. The device is based on a box enclosing the rodent cage to modify the light, feeding, and temperature environments. The device provides temperature-controlled air conditioning (heating or cooling) by a Peltier module and includes programmable feeding and illumination. All functions are set by a user-friendly front panel for independent cycle programming. Bench testing with a model simulating the CO2 production of mice in the cage showed: a) suitable air renewal (by measuring actual ambient CO2), b) controlled realistic illumination at the mouse enclosure (measured by a photometer), c) stable temperature control, and d) correct cycling of light, feeding, and temperature. The cost of all the supplies (retail purchased by e-commerce) was <300 US$. Detailed technical information is open-source provided, allowing for any user to reliably reproduce or modify the device. This approach can considerably facilitate circadian research since using one of the described low-cost devices for any mouse group with a given light-food-temperature paradigm allows for all the experiments to be performed simultaneously, thereby requiring no changes in the light/temperature of a general-use laboratory. 1 Introduction",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,1285,,,

In swarm robotics, groups of robots collaborate using local interactions and collectively solve tasks beyond an individual robot's capabilities. Individual robots must have onboard processing, communication, and sensing capabilities to autonomously react to their neighbors and immediate environment. Most research involving UAVs in swarm robotics presents only simulation results, while key landmark studies with real UAV swarms have used UAV platforms that were custom-built for the respective study. One important reason for this is that no commercial UAV platform comes pre-equipped with the ability to identify and track the positions and poses of nearby drones using only onboard sensors and computation, and in research platforms, the relevant sensing technologies are currently under development. Our aim is to provide a platform that allows swarm robotics researchers to test their algorithms on real UAVs, without having to develop their own custom-built UAVs or to wait until more advanced sensing technology is ready off-the-shelf. We provide a well-documented, entirely open-source UAV platform- S-drone (Swarm-drone)-to foster and support UAV swarm research in a laboratory environment.

The S-drone is suitable for a wide range of contexts, supports quad-camera vision-based navigation and a variety of onboard sensing, and is extensible.

The city uses open source and community-centred design to rebuild its economic model and post-pandemic recovery around the principles of economic prosperity. Next, the role of open source hardware, software, and data in the carbon negative data centre of the future blueprint being proposed by an OpenUK-led international consortium at COP26 is discussed.

It includes at least prohibition of cartels ‚Äî agreements between undertakings and concerted practices ‚Äî of abuse of dominant position or ‚Äòmonopolization‚Äô, and merger control. These areas of antitrust differ considerably. Cartels require the coordinated effort of more than one undertaking, whereas abuse of dominant position is in principle a practice committed by a single undertaking. Enforcement of cartel and abuse of dominant position rules mostly apply ex post facto, when the illegal practices have displayed some of their effects. Conversely, merger control happens before a merger between two undertakings has become effective, requiring notification of certain deals before they are consummated, therefore it is mostly ex ante and it requires a notable amount of forward-looking evaluation by the antitrust authorities.",https://academic.oup.com/book/chapter-pdf/54406751/oso-9780198862345-chapter-17.pdf,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,1316,,,

The sensor provides access to raw data and the software described in this study allows control of the signal processing chain. The design specifications permit apparent conductivity measurements in the range of between 1 mS/m and 1000 mS/m, with a resolution of 1.0 mS/m and with a sampling rate of up to 10 samples per second. The sensor allows for a synchronous acquisition of a time stamp and a location stamp for each data sample.

In this work, we propose a low-cost system for data acquisition specially designed to improve the learning experience of experimental mechanics. To achieve this purpose, we use open-source software and hardware tools to create a piece of educational equipment that is fully configurable for different sensors. We present the experimental results of two case studies: the vibration analysis of a rotor-bearing system using acceleration signals and a free-vibration study using a xylophone and a low-cost microphone. The proposed platform helps authors to complement a 4-month course named Vibration, intended for mechanical engineering students. The students who participated in the study demonstrated an improvement in their comprehension of vibration theory and modal analysis using the finite element technique. The feedback from students indicates that 84% of the participants are highly motivated to learn more about vibrations and experimental mechanics.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,1340,,,

This current practice of releasing water from reservoirs causes flash floods in downstream areas and increases the likelihood of dam failures and public outrage. Pre-release of water from reservoirs is therefore an important strategy for downstream flood mitigation. Hydrological models can simulate river flow with sufficient lead time. Thus, the resulting outputs can be effectively applied to pre-release decision making in the reservoirs. Since the beginning of computer-aided applications, many attempts have been made to establish a decision support system for reservoir flood control. However, this is hampered by manual stations, low quality data, high cost of software and data, unknown parameter values, and lack of expertise, especially in developing countries. Therefore, a total open-source solution combined with low-cost open-source hardware, free and open-source software, and open standards was seen as the only way to overcome reservoir-related flood risk. Moreover, research studies on open-source hardware, software, standards, and data are limited to a few case studies reporting real-time data on certain environmental parameters. Therefore, the application of integrated open-source technologies for reservoir flood control remains an unexplored area. In this background, a hydrological model powered by integrated open-source technology is presented in this research for reservoir pre-release decision making. The model was tested for the Deduru Oya watershed using the SWAT (Soil and Water Assessment Tool) toolkit. The calibration results appear to be satisfactory for both daily and hourly time intervals.

This ability requires the nervous system to undergo adjustments at distinct temporal scales, from short-term dynamic changes in expression of neurotransmitters and receptors to longer-term growth, spatial and connectivity reorganization, while integrating external stimuli. The nematode Caenorhabditis elegans provides a model of nervous system plasticity, in particular its dauer exit decision. Under unfavorable conditions, larvae will enter the non-feeding and non-reproductive stress-resistant dauer stage and adapt their behavior to cope with the harsh new environment, with active reversal under improved conditions leading to resumption of reproductive development. However, how different environmental stimuli regulate the exit decision mechanism and thereby drive the larva's behavioral change is unknown. To fill this gap and provide insights on behavioral changes over extended periods of time, we developed a new open hardware method for long-term imaging (12h) of C. elegans larvae.Results: Our WormObserver platform comprises open hardware and software components for video acquisition, automated processing of large image data (> 80k images/experiment) and data analysis. We identified dauer-specific behavioral motifs and characterized the behavioral trajectory of dauer exit in different environments and genetic backgrounds to identify key decision points and stimuli promoting dauer exit. Combining long-term behavioral imaging with transcriptomics data, we find that bacterial ingestion triggers a change in neuropeptide gene expression to establish post-dauer behavior.Conclusions: Taken together, we show how a developing nervous system can robustly integrate environmental changes activate a developmental switch and adapt the organism's behavior to a new environment. WormObserver is generally applicable to other research questions within and beyond the C. elegans field, having a modular and customizable character and allowing assessment of behavioral plasticity over longer periods.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,1343,,,

This article introduces Hypnos, an open hardware and software toolkit that aims to balance energy intake and usage through the adaptive sensing rate for low-cost Internet-connected IoT nodes. We describe the hardware architecture of the IoT node, an open hardware board based on the Arduino Uno form-factor packing the energy measurement circuitry, and the associated opensource software library, which interfaces with the sensing node's microcontroller and provides access to the low-level energy measurements. Hypnos comes equipped with a built-in, configurable, modified sigmoid function to regulate duty-cycle frequency based on energy intake and usage, yet developers may also plug in their custom duty/sleep balancing function. An experiment was set up, whereby two identical boards ran for two months: one with the Hypnos software framework and built-in energy-balancing function to regulate sensing rate and the other with fixed sensing rate. The experiment showed that Hypnos is able to successfully balance energy usage and sensing frequency within configurable energy ranges.

The results of the analysis show that, in most cases, Arduino boards present hardware and software limitations and security vulnerabilities, probably due to their low-cost requirement design. Some examples are: an easy-to-override firmware, lack of power protection or nonencrypted board communications in the case of Arduino Yun. Also, Arduino does not check bad use of memory stack, so bad memory operations may end up easily on memory corruption and unexpected behavior. All these limitations and vulnerabilities may lead to security breaches on the deployed environment.

It is important to highlight that the stated objectives were achieved, obtaining a functional, resilient and scalable solution where complexity is centralized in the components hosted in the cloud. In this way, the benefits of virtualization and consolidation in the cloud have been extended to telephony in recent years.

A challenge in this setting is to figure out a fast and cost-effective method of TVWS presence estimation, such as the use of open hardware and software tools, reducing sensing time. This article proposes a Rapid Estimation Method (REM) for TVWS estimation that uses the statistical information of the sensed signals. Our probabilistic approach analyzes the collected parameters of more than eight million data samples taken by scanning the TV-UHF spectrum in the city of Windsor, ON, Canada. The calculated statistical parameters and a group of auxiliary parameters were combined to estimate rapidly the amount of TVWS available in the sensed locations. By applying the proposed rapid estimation method, the presence of TVWS was identified and verified with an accuracy of about 76% according to the results obtained, the average variation when comparing the calculated and detected probabilities of TVWS was in a range of 15%, and the method could be a viable solution to the spectrum need.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,1370,,,

The ""Smart Agro. committee of Research and Education Center ""Engineering of the Future"" has identified a number of tasks relevant for improving the efficiency of precision, soil-protecting and conservation agriculture. One of these tasks is the development of a digital multi-agent system, which provides a number of services for agricultural enterprises, developers and manufacturers of agricultural machinery. The purpose of the present study is to model an autonomous mobile robotic platform, including the development of software and hardware for trajectory control. Materials and Methods.

Aquatic environmental DNA (eDNA) has emerged as a promising approach to identify organisms in freshwater and marine environments. While the recovery of eDNA from water most commonly involves capture of biological debris on a filter matrix, practitioners are yet to converge on standardized approaches for filtration, particularly in the field. This lack of standardization has resulted in inconsistent handling of samples following collection, limiting interpretation of results across studies and burdening groups with inconvenient storage and transport logistics that may compromise eDNA integrity.Methods. A simple to assemble and low-cost ($350 USD) water filtration system is demonstrated that can be used in field and laboratory settings to reduce time between sample acquisition and eDNA filtration, maximizing eDNA sample recovery. Quantitative PCR is used to show the utility of the platform for laboratory and marine eDNA analysis.Results. The resulting eDNA collection system is easily transported in a rugged water-resistant case, operates for more than eight hours on a 12-volt lead-acid battery, and has an unobstructed filtration rate of 150.05 & PLUSMN; 7.01 mL/min and 151.70 & PLUSMN; 6.72 mL/min with 0.22 & mu;m and 0.45 & mu;m Sterivex filters, respectively. We show that immediate sample filtration increases eDNA recovery in the laboratory, and demonstrate collections in aquaria and marine environments. We anticipate that providing easy to obtain, open hardware designs for eDNA sample collection will increase standardization of aquatic eDNA collection methods and improve cross-study comparisons.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,1377,,,

However, neural responses may vary due to prior experience, internal states, or stochastic factors, thus generating the need for methods that can assess neural function across many individuals at once. Whereas most recording techniques examine a single animal at a time, we describe the use of wide-field microscopy to scale up neuronal recordings to dozens of Caenorhabditis elegans or other sub-millimeter-scale organisms at once. Open-source hardware and software allow great flexibility in programming fully automated experiments that control the intensity and timing of various stimulus types, including chemical, optical, mechanical, thermal, and electromagnetic stimuli. In particular, microfluidic flow devices provide precise, repeatable, and quantitative control of chemosensory stimuli with sub-second time resolution. The NeuroTracker semi-automated data analysis pipeline then extracts individual and population-wide neural responses to uncover functional changes in neural excitability and dynamics.

Next, a single circuit board system was created and tested using the designs from the BREAD prototype to reduce the number of microcontrollers required. Both open-source control systems were capable of reliably running the pyrolysis reactor continuously, achieving equivalent performance to a state-of-the-art commercial controller with a ten-fold reduction in the overall cost of control.

However, published results usually focus on the experiment, disregarding technical details of the scientific equipment. Lacking enough information about these custom devices prevents their accurate replication, hindering the experiment reproducibility, which is a fundamental requirement for Open Science. In the field of Geology, custom electromechanical devices with low-speed moving elements are required to analyze scaled-down models of the tectonic deformation processes. In these experiments, the earth crust is modeled with materials whose properties and setup are scrupulously specified to comply with the scale model theory and to have standard and reproducible procedures. Notwithstanding this rigorous characterization, we believe that the moving apparatus has received little attention, implicitly assuming an ideal behavior despite the difficulties of moving uniformly at such slow speeds, which could produce disparities with the natural model. In this paper we address this issue by presenting a device for scientific analogue modeling of contractional and extensional tectonics. We analyze the challenges and implications of moving at such low speeds, demonstrate its satisfactory performance and provide suggestions for improvement. In addition, the proposed apparatus is not only affordable and relatively easy to build, but also is an open-hardware project that can be replicated, improved or customized, even in other research fields.

With the low reliability of improvised tourniquets, it is important to ensure that distributed manufacturing of tourniquets is effective and safe. Tourniquets can be tested, but existing tourniquet testers are expensive, bulky, and complex to operate, which limits their accessibility to an even greater extent than tourniquets in extreme settings.

Despite the research progress, the industry still doubts its applicability, especially for the functional verification of complicated processor chips. Functional verification commonly employs a simulation-based method of co-simulating the design under test with a reference model and checking the consistency of their outcomes given the same input stimuli. We observe limited collaboration and information exchange through the design and verification processes, dramatically leading to inefficiencies when applying the conventional functional verification workflow to agile development. In this paper, we propose workflow integration with collaborative task delegation and dynamic information exchange as the design principles to effectively address the challenges on functional verification under the agile development model. Based on workflow integration, we enhance the functional verification workflows with a series of novel methodologies and toolchains. The diff-rule based agile verification methodology (DRAV) reduces the overhead of building reference models with runtime execution information from designs under test. We present the RISC-V implementation for DRAV, DiffTest, which adopts information probes to extract internal design behaviors for co-simulation and debugging. It further integrates two plugins, namely XFUZZ for effective test generation guided by design coverage metrics and LightSSS for efficient fault analysis triggered by co-simulation mismatches. We present the integrated workflows for agile hardware development and demonstrate their effectiveness in designing and verifying RISC-V processors with 33 functional bugs found in NutShell. We also illustrate the efficiency of the proposed toolchains with a case study on a functional bug in the L2 cache of XiangShan.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,1395,,,

A gate, such as a door, can have a lock mechanism for securing the area from unauthorized access. Most commercial solutions for access control management offer pre-packaged software systems where customization of the authorization logic is either not allowed or subject to payment. Moreover, cross-platform development is a barrier for solution providers due to the high cost of development and maintenance that it implies. To overcome these limitations and further optimize the entire access control systems development process, we propose a model-driven approach that supports automatic code generation to enable communication between an IoT infrastructure and platforms for Facility Access Management. Specifically, the approach combines the benefits of Near-Field Communication (NFC) and Tinkerforge (i.e., an open-source hardware platform) with model-driven techniques. This allows the approach to exploit both behavioral and structural models for the modeling and the consequent code generation of part of the authorization mechanism, thus providing complete coverage of the code generated for the whole system. We implemented and evaluated our approach in a real-world case study within the premises of a fitness center with an IoT infrastructure consisting of several heterogeneous sensors by showing its practical applicability. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in supporting abstraction and automation concerning traditional code-centric development through code generation features. Consequently, our approach makes the whole development process less time-consuming and error-prone, thus reducing the system's time to market.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,1396,,,

The controller is made exclusively of 3D-printed and commercially available parts. We evaluated the quality of our controller by comparing it to a non-MRI compatible controller that was kept outside the scanner. The comparison of response latencies showed reliable button press accuracies of adequate precision. Comparison of the subjects' motion during fMRI recordings of various tasks showed that the use of our controller did not increase the amount of motion produced compared to a regular MR compatible button press box. Motion levels during an ecological videogame task were of moderate amplitude.

To ensure that a private network satisfies its own requirements and guarantees coverage, it is important to accurately measure the radio performance at the accurate position to further optimize the network. Additionally, as carrier frequencies increase, cellular network-based positioning becomes increasingly important, as it enables more accurate positioning. For example, centimeter-level accuracy is expected in beyond 5G systems owing to the sub-THz band carrier frequency. To accurately compare and assess various cellular network-based positioning methods, positioning devices, which can move along the same trajectory more accurately than at the centimeter-level, are required. To this end, we implemented a three-dimensional (3D) positioning device developed from open-source hardware, which is generally used to implement computer numerical control (CNC) machines and 3D printers. The implemented 3D pointing device is cost-effective and portable and can be freely configurable and resized in one, two, and three dimensions owing to the use of open-source hardware. The received signal strength indicator (RSSI) employing the LoRa module can be obtained using the implemented device. Using a very low carrier frequency system, it is possible to accurately measure the RSSI variations due to multipath propagation.

Although autoinjectors can offset healthcare treatment costs through self-administered medication, they can be expensive for consumers, which limit their accessibility. This study describes the design and manufacture of a spring-driven and 3-D printed autoinjector to overcome this economic accessibility challenge. The digitally replicable device is released as open-source hardware to enable low-cost distributed manufacturing. The bill of materials and assembly instructions are detailed, and the effectiveness of the autoinjector is tested against the current standard (ISO 11608-1:2022) for needle-based injection systems. The safety and dosing accuracy was tested by measuring the weight of 100% ethyl alcohol expelled from six BD Insulin syringes with varying capacities or needle lengths. A one-way analysis assessed the variability between the dose delivery efficiency of 1mL, 0.5mL, and 0.3mL syringes. Testing indicated that the entire dose was delivered over 97.5% of the time for 1mL and 0.5mL syringes, but the autoinjector's loaded spring force and size exceeded structural limitations of 0.3mL or smaller syringes. Components can be manufactured in about twelve hours using an open-source desktop RepRap-class fused filament 3-D printer. The construction requires two compression springs and 3-D printed parts. The total material cost of CAD$6.83 is less than a tenth of comparable commercial autoinjectors, which makes this approach promising.

The technique is also applied to effectively map the field in the presence of magnetic shields that can be used to reduce electromagnetic distortions passively. Unlike calibration techniques commonly found in literature, which aim to correct the tracking position error, our method can reconstruct an analytical magnetic field model starting from a reduced amount of scattered data. This way, a faster convergence of the solver algorithm is obtained, and EMT position and orientation errors are inherently corrected. The new modeling technique was applied to generate a new, undistorted magnetic field model for Anser EMT, to demonstrate the effectiveness of passive shielding, and to compensate for the distortion introduced by a commercial fluoroscopy C-arm. Furthermore, the concept of a real-time distortion compensation technique is expressed based on the modeling method presented in this article.

We have created a robust column rack design, with collection vial holders, that is easily made, inexpensive to build, and may be easily adapted to fit experimental needs. The column holder can be made to hold various sizes of columns (and can be interchanged as neces-sary); the height of columns above collection vials can be precisely set; and the design is modular, so the rack and vial holders can be expanded to accommodate the desired num-bers of columns and the numbers and sizes of vials used to collect fractions eluted from each column.

However, there is currently a lack of instrumentation to monitor such experiments in real time, necessitating repeated transfers of the samples to stand-alone analytical instruments, thus limiting the types of experiments that could be performed. Here we address this gap with the development of the optoPlateReader (oPR), an open-source, solid-state, compact device that allows automated optogenetic stimulation and spectroscopy in each well of a 96-well plate. The oPR integrates an optoPlate illumination module with a module called the optoReader, an array of 96 photodiodes and LEDs that allows 96 parallel light measurements. The oPR was optimized for stimulation with blue light and for measurements of optical density and fluorescence. After calibration of all device components, we used the oPR to measure growth and to induce and measure fluorescent protein expression in E. coli. We further demonstrated how the optical read/write capabilities of the oPR permit computer-in-the-loop feedback control, where the current state of the sample can be used to adjust the optical stimulation parameters of the sample according to pre-defined feedback algorithms. The oPR will thus help realize an untapped potential for optogenetic experiments by enabling automated reading, writing, and feedback in microwell plates through open-source hardware that is accessible, customizable, and inexpensive.

Acquiring such a policy on a real robot is a tedious and time-consuming task. This is more challenging in a multi-agent system where individual data may be required from each agent. While training in simulations is the common approach due to efficiency and low-cost, they rarely describe the real world. Consequently, policies trained in simulations and transferred to the real robot usually perform poorly. In this paper, we present a novel real-to-sim-to-real framework to bridge the reality gap for an agent in collective motion of a homogeneous multi-agent system. First, we propose a novel deep neural-network architecture termed Convolutional-Recurrent Network (CR-Net) to capture the complex state transition of an agent and simulate its motion. Once trained with data from one agent, we show that the CR-Net can accurately predict motion of all agents in the group. Second, we propose to invest a limited amount of real data from the agent in a generative model. Then, training the CR-Net with synthetic data sampled from the generative model is shown to be at least equivalent to real data. Hence, the proposed approach provides a sufficiently accurate model with significantly less real data. The generative model can also be disseminated along with open-source hardware for easier usage. We show experiments on ground and underwater vehicles in which multi-agent RL policies are trained in the simulation for collective motion and successfully transferred to the real-world.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,1414,,,

Furthermore, blockchain is divided into three layers: protocol layer, network layer, and data layer. This chapter focuses on the protocol layer software such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, EOS, and Cordera. However, the software stack for blockchain systems which build on top of these protocol layers is very complex and varies based on the blockchain system. The protocol layers, such as Bitcoin and Ethereum, are sometimes referred to as ‚ÄòLayer 1‚Äô or the ‚Äòbase layer‚Äô. Some blockchain systems also have ‚ÄòLayer 2‚Äô software such as the ‚ÄòLightening Network‚Äô for Bitcoin. Blockchain systems also host application software, with smart contacts, tokens, and ‚ÄòDApps‚Äô, all of which are software.",https://academic.oup.com/book/chapter-pdf/54406766/oso-9780198862345-chapter-22.pdf,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,1417,,,

From computing devices, scientific instrumentation, and biological reagents, to remote sensing satellites, researchers rely on hardware to explore and understand the world. However, research equipment is typically based on closed source (i.e. proprietary) hardware, whose designs are legally restricted, preventing others from studying, building, or modifying them. These restrictions cause several problems such as: lack of reproducibility; duplication of effort; forced obsolescence; and higher costs. Crucially, the inefficiencies of closed source hardware reinforce global inequities. This is because the design and manufacturing of research equipment is often monopolised by producers in the Global North. Restricted access to hardware designs mean that only authorised dealers and technicians are allowed to sell or maintain equipment. These services are often unavailable to, or prohibitively expensive for, researchers belonging to historically marginalised communities outside of the Global North. Building on the success of open source software, open source hardware is defined as any physical artefact whose ‚Äúdesign is made publicly available with explicit, legally binding freedoms for anyone to study, modify, distribute, make, and sell the design or hardware based on that design‚Äù. Open science hardware is an emerging field of practice which studies and applies the principles of open source hardware to research contexts. In 2021, it was formally recognised as a key component in the UNESCO Recommendation on Open Science. Open science hardware provides many benefits compared to its proprietary counterparts. This can include cost savings of up to 87% (Pearce, 2020) and proportional to how often it is replicated; quicker iteration of designs; and adaptation to local needs in underserved communities. Since the 2010s, open science hardware has been developed and used in diverse domains from environmental monitoring, and lab automation, to microscopy. In addition to academics, open science hardware is commonly built by citizen science communities and adapted for different purposes. Other practitioners of open science hardware include educators, social innovators, or artists. In this talk, we provide an overview of open science hardware and the problems it solves. We also provide successful examples of open science hardware projects that serve to not only do good science, but also address global inequities. The talk also presents the Gathering for Open Science Hardware, an international network working towards the adoption of open source hardware across research lifecycle. ¬†",http://journals.ed.ac.uk/eor/article/download/8112/11875,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,1419,,,

A lack of affordable and adaptable tools in this area limits research progress and harmonized quality assurance. Purpose: To develop and test a suite of open‚Äêsource hardware and software tools for the measurement, characterization, reporting, and correction of geometric distortion in MRI. Methods: An open‚Äêsource python library was developed, comprising modules for parametric phantom design, data processing, spherical harmonics, distortion correction, and interactive reporting. The code was used to design and manufacture a distortion phantom consisting of 618 oil filled markers covering a sphere of radius 150¬†mm. This phantom was imaged on a CT scanner and a novel split‚Äêbore 1.0 T MRI magnet. The CT images provide distortion‚Äêfree dataset. These data were used to test all modules of the open‚Äêsource software. Results: All markers were successfully extracted from all images. The distorted MRI markers were mapped to undistorted CT data using an iterative search approach. Spherical harmonics reconstructed the fitted gradient data to 1.0¬†¬±¬†0.6% of the input data. High resolution data were reconstructed via spherical harmonics and used to generate an interactive report. Finally, distortion correction on an independent data set reduced distortion inside the DSV from 5.5¬†¬±¬†3.1 to 1.6¬†¬±¬†0.8¬†mm. Conclusion: Open‚Äêsource hardware and software for the measurement, characterization, reporting, and correction of geometric distortion in MRI have been developed. The utility of these tools has been demonstrated via their application on a novel 1.0 T split bore magnet.",https://aapm.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/mp.17342,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,1427,,,

CubeSats as a sub-class of nanosatellites have become a game-changer in the industry of scientific research and exploration of the new space technologies. Their cost effectiveness, relative ease of manufacturing, and the predicted lifecycle are the main factors of success. Having such popularity in mind ‚Äì many vendors, student teams and enthusiast started to build their platforms to offer reuse and faster buildup of such satellites, introducing so-called COTS/MOTS approach of the satellite‚Äôs construction. However, looking into statistics ‚Äì only 2.5% of the launched satellites were able to full perform their mission, and almost 25% just failed. Partially, the key problems are in the area of using non-radiation hardened electronics as the CubeSat idea is to use commercial (or at utmost automotive) components. Authors of the article provide a holistic view on the existing hardware and software platforms that are currently available as COTS/MOTS solutions, as well as their capabilities. Part of the research was done in the area of the available software frameworks, as the modern software has rather high cyclomatic complexity and often it is exactly software components that make CubeSat mission at risk. Software related frameworks are compared via the use of newly introduced by the authors multi-factor ranking model (FMCSA). At the same time the article raises the cross-country problem of the creation and use of the Ukrainian platform for the CubeSats. Authors propose a solution for the creation of the part of the CubeSat platform as the starting point and it is an On-Board Computer (OBC). The idea is to design an OBC that can solve the big portion of the known issues of the CubeSat hardware and software with the major stress on the hardware issues related to the Single-Event Upset (SEU) and Single-Event Latch Up (SEL), without moving to the radiation tolerant semiconductors. Proposed in the article solution combines the selection of the modern central processor, that is industry recognized, availability of the software solutions for it, as well as the power-domains control principle that allows to minimize the potential harm of the SEU and SEL radiation-driven events.",http://rocketspace.dp.ua/index.php/rst/article/download/185/153,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,1448,,,

Among the various techniques available, photoplethysmography stands out as particularly promising for assessing vital signs such as heart rate, respiratory rate, oxygen saturation, and blood pressure. Despite the efficacy of this method, many commercially available wearables, bearing Conformit√© Europ√©enne marks and the approval of the Food and Drug Administration, are often integrated within proprietary, closed data ecosystems and are very expensive. In an effort to democratize access to affordable wearable devices, our research endeavored to develop an open-source photoplethysmographic sensor utilizing off-the-shelf hardware and open-source software components. The primary aim of this investigation was to ascertain whether the combination of off-the-shelf hardware components and open-source software yielded vital-sign measurements (specifically heart rate and respiratory rate) comparable to those obtained from more expensive, commercially endorsed medical devices. Conducted as a prospective, single-center study, the research involved the assessment of fifteen participants for three minutes in four distinct positions, supine, seated, standing, and walking in place. The sensor consisted of four PulseSensors measuring photoplethysmographic signals with green light in reflection mode. Subsequent signal processing utilized various open-source Python packages. The heart rate assessment involved the comparison of three distinct methodologies, while the respiratory rate analysis entailed the evaluation of fifteen different algorithmic combinations. For one-minute average heart rates‚Äô determination, the Neurokit process pipeline achieved the best results in a seated position with a Spearman‚Äôs coefficient of 0.9 and a mean difference of 0.59 BPM. For the respiratory rate, the combined utilization of Neurokit and Charlton algorithms yielded the most favorable outcomes with a Spearman‚Äôs coefficient of 0.82 and a mean difference of 1.90 BrPM. This research found that off-the-shelf components are able to produce comparable results for heart and respiratory rates to those of commercial and approved medical wearables.",https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/24/12/3766/pdf,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,1454,,,

Besides a digital infrastructure, this framework also needs a legal infrastructure in order to ensure compliance with the Fab City principles. In this regard, the law presents two conflicting approaches: exclusivity through Intellectual Property Rights (IPRs) or sharing of information based on the credo of the open-source movement. Both of these approaches might be necessary to enable the Fab City concept to flourish. This article will address this seeming dichotomy. We will further examine the relevance of IPRs and their respective features to the Fab City framework and address licensing challenges that may emerge from their use.",https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/978-3-658-44114-2_10,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,1522,,,

Die rechtlichen Fragen, die sich in diesem Zusammenhang stellen, sind durchaus komplex und neuartig. Das liegt zum einen an der Natur der Wertsch√∂pfungskette von OSH, bei der auf verschiedenen Stufen (Designentwurf, Herstellung, Verbreitung) unterschiedliche Personen(gruppen) beteiligt sind. Zum anderen wird OSH h√§ufig aus altruistischen Zwecken und von Laien entworfen, hergestellt und verbreitet, f√ºr die ein einheitlicher Sorgfaltsma√üstab nur schwer zu bilden ist. In diesem Beitrag wird √ºberblicksartig auf die potenzielle Haftung der Designer eines OSH-Bauplanes eingegangen.

Four DBS cases were included in the study, and a retrospective study was performed. RESULTS: Electrode placement to bilateral subthalamic nuclei was performed due to Parkinson‚Äôs Disease to all four patients. One of the patients was undergone surgical wound site revision 6 times and device removal at last due to device-related infection and erosion of the surgical wound site. The second patient was undergone surgical wound site revision for 2 times and device removal at last due to device-related infection and erosion of the surgical wound site. The third patient had a collection subcutaneously, where the pulse generator was placed. The collection was aspirated. The fourth patient was undergone surgical wound site revision and device removal at last due to device-related infection and erosion of the surgical wound site. All four patients were given IV antibiotics. CONCLUSION: For the treatment of DBS device-related infections, a long-term IV antibiotherapy is a suitable option before the decision of device removal.",https://oamjms.eu/index.php/mjms/article/download/5530/5066,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,1536,,,

It is the application of Arduino that makes artworks more dynamic and appealing, so it is easier for viewers to resonate with the emotions that the artworks convey. Moreover, as the relationship between human society and the ecological environment has become increasingly closer, environmental issues have sparked heated discussions, in which designers and artists also participate with their unique artistic language. The device, ‚ÄúCity Countdown‚Äù, stands as an artistic creation and it is designed in accordance with the reflection on the current global warming and is supported by Arduino, an open-source hardware platform. This artwork intends to achieve the interaction between viewers and itself, so as to guide people to realize the negative impact of human activities on climate change, and to further reflect on the today‚Äôs human life.",https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1755-1315/687/1/012118/pdf,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,1545,,,

Such strategies require the development of a vibrant ecosystem of partners that combines the innovation capabilities of hundreds of companies from different industries. Our aim is to help decision makers assess the benefits and challenges associated with creating or joining such ecosystems. We use a case study approach on six major collaborative ecosystems that enable the development of complex, high cost infrastructures and platforms. We characterize their strategy, governance, and their degree of intellectual property (IP) openness. We offer a three-dimensional framework that helps managers characterize such ecosystems. Although all the ecosystems studied aim at scaling up innovative solutions, their strategy, governance and IP openness vary. An upstream strategy aimed at replacing supplier proprietary design with open substitutes requires a democratic governance and an intellectual property policy that maximize the attractiveness of the ecosystem. A downstream strategy aimed at carving a space in new markets requires an autocratic governance and an intellectual property policy that combine attractiveness and value capture opportunities.",https://journalsojs3.fe.up.pt/index.php/jim/article/download/2183-0606_009-002_0003/536,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,1546,,,

These gains in performance have come at a cost of increase in computational complexity and memory bandwidth. Recent studies have explored the fixed-point implementation of DNN algorithms such as AlexNet and VGG on Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) to facilitate the potential of deployment on embedded system. However, there are still lacking research on DNN object detection algorithms on FPGA. Consequently, we propose the implementation of Tiny-Yolo-v2 on Cyclone V PCIe FPGA board using the High-Level Synthesis Tool: Intel FPGA Software Development Kit (SDK) for OpenCL. In this work, a systematic approach is proposed to convert the floating point Tiny-Yolo-v2 algorithms into 8-bit fixed-point. Our experiments show that the 8-bit fixed-point Tiny-Yolo-v2 have significantly reduce the hardware consumption with only 0.3% loss in accuracy. Finally, our implementation achieves peak performance of 31.34 Giga Operation per Second (GOPS) and comparable performance density of 0.28GOPs/DSP to prior works under 120MHz working frequency.",https://www.ijrte.org/wp-content/uploads/papers/v8i2S6/B11500782S619.pdf,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,1550,,,

A 34-year-old man presented with pain and swelling of the left leg, where he had previously sustained an open tibia fracture 1 year prior. After the initial injury, he underwent four corrective surgeries (including bone graft and internal-fixation) and was asymptomatic for 6 months before these new symptoms developed. MRI revealed a 6.5 √ó 5.1 √ó 2.7 cm abscess and tibial osteomyelitis. Surgical staff performed an aggressive incision and drainage (I&D) with saucerization of the tibia, to treat what seemed to be a routine hardware infection. Five days later, tissue cultures grew Brucella melitensis. Upon further questioning, the patient described butchering a wild boar 10 days prior to symptom onset. Methods: The CDC provides guidance on serological testing and post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) for persons exposed to Brucella in the laboratory setting. Upon identification of this patient‚Äôs Brucella isolates, infection control staff identified all laboratory workers that met CDC criteria for ‚Äúhigh risk‚Äù exposure, as well as other healthcare workers (HCW) exposed to aerosolized infectious material (including those workers in the operating room during pulse lavage of the abscess). Results: Staff identified 34 HCW with presumed high-risk exposure, including 19 laboratory personnel, 13 operating room personnel, and two patient care technicians. Baseline serology was obtained on all 34 HCW, and PEP with rifampin and doxycycline was prescribed for each. Nine of the exposed employees changed PEP therapy due to intolerance, and follow-up serology was obtained on 32 of the 34 healthcare workers, with zero seroconversions found. Conclusion: Brucellosis is a rare disease in clinical practice, so a high index of suspicion is necessary to enact appropriate precautions before widespread exposures. When exposure is identified after the fact, efficient protocols should be in place to identify all susceptible individuals. Due to the low infectious dose of Brucella melitensis, CDC guidance should be expanded to include aerosolizing procedures outside of the laboratory.

However, entering this field of research is difficult since such an implant requires components from many different areas of technology. Since the complete avoidance of wires is important due to the risk of infections and other long-term problems, means for wirelessly transmitting data and energy are a necessity which adds to the requirements. In recent literature, many high-tech components for such implants are presented with remarkable properties. However, these components are typically not freely available for such a system. Every group needs to re-develop their own solution. This raises the question if it is possible to create a reusable design for an implant and its external base-station, such that it allows other groups to use it as a starting point. In this article, we try to answer this question by presenting a design based exclusively on commercial off-the-shelf components and studying the properties of the resulting system.

Methods: The hardware comprises a home-built 8-channel pTx system (scalable to 32-channels), wideband power amplifiers and a positioning system with submillimeter precision. The orthogonal projection (OP) method is used to mitigate RF induced tip heating and to maintain sufficientB1+for imaging. Experiments are performed at 297MHz and inside a clinical 3T MRI using 8-channel pTx RF coils, a guidewire substitute inside a phantom with attached thermistor and time-domainE-field probes. Results: Repeatability and precision are similar to 3% forE-field measurements including guidewire repositioning, similar to 3% for temperature slopes and an similar to 6% root-mean-square deviation betweenB1+measurements and simulations. Real-time pTx mitigation with the OP mode reduces theE-fields everywhere within the investigated area with a maximum reduction factor of 26 compared to the circularly polarized mode. Tip heating was measured with similar to 100 mu K resolution and similar to 14 Hz sampling frequency and showed substantial reduction for the OP vs CP mode. Conclusion: The pTx medical implant safety testbed presents a much-needed flexible and modular hardware configuration for the in-vitro assessment of implant safety, covering all field strengths from 0.5-7 T. Sensor based real-time mitigation strategies utilizing pTx and the OP method allow to substantially reduce RF induced implant heating while maintaining sufficient image quality without the need for a priori knowledge based on simulations or in-vitro testing.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,1571,,,

Most devices currently sold are restricted to operating characteristics of lithium battery technologies, which are different in different ways from the operation of other types of batteries that are studied and developed in laboratories. The restriction of use in other technologies could be circumvented through open platforms, allowing modifications in the BMS in order to adapt to the application technology. This adaptive characteristic is rarely found in commercialized devices, being fundamental when the objective of the BMS is linked to academic research that requires experimental steps. Therefore, this work proposes a low cost adaptive open source BMS prototype, capable of monitoring the variables of voltage, current, temperature and state of charge for a battery with up to 10 cells in series. The development includes hardware and software for the basic functioning of BMS functions. The proposed BMS was developed based on two cell technologies with: 18650 lithium ions, and sodium nickel chloride. The versatility of BMS in operating on these two technologies aims to demonstrate the adaptive capacity of the system. For remote monitoring, an interface was developed using the Node-RED and IBM Watson tools.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,1580,,,

To address these challenges, we propose a unique approach to compile a dataset of open-source hardware design defects and their remediation steps, utilizing version control data. This dataset provides a substantial foundation for training machine learning models for hardware. LLM4SECHW employs fine-tuning of medium-sized LLMs based on this dataset, enabling the identification and rectification of bugs in hardware designs.

The dependability of the Internet of Things is critical because the services will be concerned with real life. However, the inexpensive hardware provides limited resources for communication. In this paper, we present exact all-terminal reliability of the wireless networks of which the number of links of each node is bounded. First, we analyze the all-terminal reliability of the regular wireless network, where any two nodes are connected by a wireless link consisting of a pair of radio modules. The reliability polynomial is derived from the Tutte polynomial that is the seminal work of the algebraic graph theory. Second, we analyze the all-terminal reliability of the wireless network including the random mesh network under the assumption that if the module fails, all radio links connected through a radio module are cut off. We consider both the fault of the communication module and the fading of the wireless channel in the indoor channel condition. For improving the reliability, we also propose a fault-tolerant method giving redundant radio modules into each node. We also analyze cost-effectiveness. We also calculate the mean-time-to-failure (MTTF) for wireless networks. We show that the random mesh network of which each node includes three or more the radio-broadcast modules is more dependable than any other regular network of which each node comprises four point-to-point modules if it is the connected graph in the static environment.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,1583,,,

Despite technological advances and a need for methodological improvements, chromogenic and fluorogenic enzymatic techniques remain the mainstays of water quality monitoring for both public health agencies and regulated utilities. We demonstrated that bioelectroanalytical approaches to FIB enumeration are possible and can be achieved using commercially available enzyme-specific resorufin glycosides, although these are expensive, not widely available or designed for purpose. Following this, we designed two naphthoquinone glycosides which performed better, achieving Escherichia coli detection in the range 5.0x10(2) to 5.0x10(5) CFUml(-1) 22-54% quicker than commercially available resorufin glycosides. The molecular design of the naphthoquinone glycosides requires fewer synthetic steps allowing them to be produced for as little as US$50 per kg. Tests with environmental samples demonstrated the low tendency for abiotic interference and that, despite specificity being maintained between -glucuronidase and -galactosidase, accurate enumeration of E.coli in environmental samples necessitates development of a selective medium. In comparison to a commercially available detection method, which has U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) approval, our approach performed better at high organism concentrations, detecting 500 organisms in 9h compared with 13.5h for the commercial method. Bioelectroanalytical detection is comparable to current approved methods and with further development could result in improved detection times. A recent trend for low-cost open-source hardware means that automated, potentiostatically controlled E.coli detection systems could be constructed for less than US$100 per channel.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,1584,,,

However, they suffer from some design issues related to the difficulty to implement them on different hardware platforms without additional efforts. To bridge this gap, recently, the IEEE Computational Intelligence Society has sponsored the publication of the standard IEEE Std 1855-2016 which is aimed at providing the fuzzy community with a well-defined approach to model FRBSs in a hardware-independent way. In order to provide a runnable version of an FRBS that is designed in accordance with the IEEE Std 1855-2016, the open source library Java Fuzzy Markup Language (JFML) has been developed. However, due to hardware and/or software limitations of embedded systems, it is not always possible to run an IEEE Std 1855-2016 FRBS on this kind of systems. The aim of this paper is to overcome this drawback by developing a new JFML module that assists developers in the design and implementation of FRBSs for open hardware-embedded systems. In detail, the module supports several connection types (WiFi, Bluetooth, and USB) in order to make feasible running FRBSs in a remote computer when, due to hardware limitations, it is not possible that they run locally in the embedded systems. The new JFML module is ready for ArduinoTM and Raspberry Pi, but it can be easily extended to other hardware architectures. Moreover, the new JFML module allows to automatically generate runnable files on Arduino(TM) or Raspberry Pi in order to support nonexpert users, that is, users without specific knowledge about embedded systems or without strong programming skills. The use of the new JFML module is illustrated in two case studies. (c) 2019 The Authors.

Low-cost gas metal arc wire (GMAW)-based 3-D printing enables wire arc additive manufacturing (WAAM) for near net shape applications, but has limited resolution due to the complexities of the arcing process. To begin to monitor and thus control these complexities, the initial designs of the open source GMAW 3-D printer have evolved to include current and voltage monitoring. Building on this prior work, in this study, the design, fabrication and use of the open source arc analyzer is described. The arc analyzer is a multi-sensor monitoring system for quantifying the processing during WAAM, which includes voltage, current, sound, light intensity, radio frequency, and temperature data outputs. The open source arc analyzer is tested here on aluminum WAAM by varying wire feed rate and measuring the resultant changes in the sensor data. Visual inspection and microstructural analysis of the printed samples looking for the presence of porosity are used as the physical indicators of quality. The value of the sensors was assessed and the most impactful sensors were found to be the light and radio frequency sensors, which showed arc extinction events and a characteristic ""good weld"" peak frequency.

This approach has the potential to dramatically change many fields of study including that of microscope use in research settings. Automated microscopy is often a challenging and inaccessible field due to the cost and non-interchangeable stages, the flat plate on which samples are placed for analysis. This paper presents a low-cost, open source microscope 3-D stage. A RepRap 3-D printer was converted to an optical microscope equipped with a customized, 3-D printed holder for a USB microscope. Precision measurements were determined to have an average error of 10 ?m at the maximum speed and 27 ?m at the minimum recorded speed. Accuracy tests yielded an error of 0.15%. The machine is a true 3-D stage and thus able to operate with USB microscopes or conventional desktop microscopes.

For emerging technologies, such as ambient ionization mass spectrometry (AIMS), the assembly of a functional prototype is often more time-consuming than developing the actual probes. The modification of commercial platforms for testing hardware is usually not possible due to technical and legal restrictions. Therefore, we designed a robotic platform, which is based on RepRap 3D-printer components, and therefore easy to adopt for custom set-ups. Adjustable rails in an aluminium frame construction facilitate the mounting of additional parts such as sensors, probes, or optical components. The Open LabBot uses industry-standard G-code for its control. Its simple syntax facilitates the programming of the movement. We developed two programs for the robot control and mass spectrometry imaging: ""LABI-Imaging"" for synchronizing the robot movements and MS data acquisition and ""RmsiGUI"", a software solution for the complete AIMS workflow. We proved the functionality of the system by the automated sampling and classification of essential oils with a PlasmaChip probe. Further, we performed an AIMSI imaging experiment of a lime slice with laser desorption low-temperature plasma (LD-LTP) ionization, demonstrating the integration of the complete workflow in RmsiGUI.

Given fundamental power requirements for such communication, burdened mass guidelines and battery technology, this constraint necessitates the continued use of very high frequency (VHF) radio beacons. As such, efforts should be made to mitigate their primary deficiencies: detection range, localization time and localization accuracy. The integration of a radiotelemetry system with an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) could significantly improve the capacity for data collection from VHF tags. We present a UAV-integrated radiotelemetry system that relies on open source hardware and software. Localization methods, including signal processing, bearing estimation based on principal component analysis, localization techniques and test results, are discussed. Using a low-power beacon applicable for bats and small birds, testing showed that the improved vantage of the UAV-radiotelemetry system (UAV-RT) provided significantly higher received signal power compared to the low-level flights (maximum range beyond 1.4 km). Flight testing of localization methods showed median bearing errors between 2.3 degrees and 6.8 degrees, with localization errors of between 5% and 14% of the distance to the tag. In a direct comparison to an experienced radiotelemetry user, the UAV-RT system provided bearing and localization estimates with 53% less error. This paper introduces the core functionality and use methods of the UAV-RT system, while presenting baseline localization performance metrics. An associated website hosts plans for assembly and software installation. The methods of UAV-RT use for tag detection will be further developed in future works. For both the detection and localization problems, the mobility of a flying asset drastically reduces tracker time requirements. A 7-min flight would be sufficient to collect five equally spaced bearing estimates over a 1-km transect. The use of a software-defined radio on the UAV-RT system will allow for the simultaneous detection and localization of multiple tags.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,1626,,,

In this work, a low cost data acquisition system (Geophonino) has been developed for recording seismic signals from a vertical geophone. The signal goes first through an instrumentation amplifier, INA155, which is suitable for low amplitude signals like the seismic noise, and an anti-aliasing filter based on the MAX7404 switched-capacitor filter. After that, the amplified and filtered signal is digitized and processed by Arduino Due and registered in an SD memory card. Geophonino is configured for continuous registering, where the sampling frequency, the amplitude gain and the registering time are user-defined. The complete prototype is an open source and open hardware system. It has been tested by comparing the registered signals with the ones obtained through different commercial data recording systems and different kind of geophones. The obtained results show good correlation between the tested measurements, presenting Geophonino as a low-cost alternative system for seismic data recording. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

From a technical point of view, the use of compound parabolic collectors (CPC) has been consolidated in the last decades. However, the relatively high cost of tooling conventional manufacturing processes for these collectors makes them difficult to afford in the most impoverished regions. This work presents the development of low-cost CPC and parabolic through solar collectors (PTC) by 3D printing of the structure and the use of recycled reflective materials. Besides, open-source hardware has been used to control system operation, including a supplementary UV LED system to compensate for the operation under low solar irradiance. Regarding the tested reflective materials, an optimum is obtained using an aluminium adhesive sheet that leads to an efficiency of 80% compared to a commercial CPC made of high-quality anodised aluminium, being the cost 20 times lower. On the other hand, incorporating a low-cost solar tracking system in a printed PTC reactor could lead to efficiencies up to 300% compared to the commercial CPC, while the cost was 4.5 times lower. Finally, the LED compensation system was successfully validated, allowing the operation with a constant treatment capacity during operation in cloudy conditions. In conclusion, the developed collectors are high-performance solar water treatment systems with a significantly lower investment cost, making them affordable worldwide. (c) 2021 The Authors.

MCRs are miniature multifunctional devices usually constrained in both size and on-board power supply. The design process for MCRs is time consuming and resource intensive, as it involves the development of custom hardware and software components. In this work, we present the STORM Lab Modular Architecture for Capsules (SMAC), a modular open source architecture for MCRs aiming to provide the MCRs research community with a tool for shortening the design and development time for capsule robots. The SMAC platform consists of both hardware modules and firmware libraries that can be used for developing MCRs. In particular, the SMAC modules are miniature boards of uniform diameter (i.e., 9.8 mm) that are able to fulfill five different functions: signal coordination combined with wireless data transmission, sensing, actuation, powering and vision/illumination. They are small in size, low power, and have reconfigurable software libraries for the Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL), which has been proven to work reliably for different types of MCRs. A design template for a generic SMAC application implementing a robust communication protocol is presented in this work, together with its finite state machine abstraction, capturing all the architectural components involved. The reliability of the wireless link is assessed for different levels of data transmission power and separation distances. The current consumption for each SMAC module is quantified and the timing of a SMAC radio message transmission is characterized.

Some sensors deployed for these purposes such as temperature, relative humidity, atmospheric pressure, and carbon dioxide sensors require protection from climate factors to avoid bias. Radiation shields hold and protect sensors to avoid this bias, but commercial systems are limited, often expensive, and difficult to implement in low-cost contexts or large deployments for collaborative sensing. To overcome these challenges, this work presents an open source, easily adapted and customized design of a radiation shield. The device can be fabricated with inexpensive off-the-shelf parts and 3-D printed components and can be adapted to protect and isolate different types of sensors. Two material approaches are tested here: polylactic acid (PLA), the most common 3-D printing filament, and acrylonitrile styrene acrylate (ASA), which is known to offer better resistance against UV radiation, greater hardness, and generally higher resistance to degradation. To validate the designs, the two prototypes were installed on a custom outdoor meteorological system and temperature and humidity measurements were made in several locations for one month and compared against a proprietary system and a system with no shield. The 3-D printed materials were also both tested multiple times for one month for UV stability of their mechanical properties, their optical transmission and deformation under outdoor high-heat conditions. The results showed that ASA is the preferred material for this design and that the open source radiation shield could match the performance of proprietary systems. The open source system can be constructed for about nine US dollars, which enables mass development of flexible weather stations for monitoring needed in smart agriculture.(c) 2022 The Author(s).

The superior-inferior movement required to simulate tumour motion during a normal breathing cycle was achieved via the novel use of an Arduino Uno (TM), a low-cost open-source microcontroller board connected to a high torque servo motor. Slow CT imaging was used to acquire the image set and a 4D cone beam CT (4D-CBCT) verified the efficacy of contoured margins before treatment on the moving phantom. Treatment fields were delivered to a section of a CIRS (TM) anthropomorphic phantom. Dose verification to the dynamic phantom with Gafchromic EBT3 film using 3 %-1 mm gamma analysis acceptance criteria registered an absolute dose pass rate for IMRT and VMAT of 98 and 96.6 %, respectively. It was verified that 100 % of the PTV received the prescribed dose of 12 Gy per fraction using the dynamic phantom, and no major discrepancy between planned and measured results due to interplay between multileaf collimator sequences and target motion was observed. This study confirmed that the use of an in-house solution using open source hardware and software with existing quality assurance equipment was appropriate in validating a new treatment technique.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,1648,,,

This amplification is connected with the resonant frequency, which can be estimated applying the horizontal-to-vertical spectral ratio (1-1/V) method on seismic noise measurements. In this work, a low-cost user-friendly data acquisition system (Geophonino-3D) has been designed for three-component seismic noise recording. The developed system consists of the signal conditioning circuit and the Arduino Due with an SD Shield for data storage. The suitability of the equipment for the application of the H/V method has been first assessed in the laboratory, according to the experimental sensitivity, the internal noise stability and the channel consistency. Subsequently, experimental verification has been carried out by recording seismic noise at eight different sites along the province of Alicante (southeast Spain), with different soil characteristics. The performance of the developed acquisition system has been evaluated in terms of the power spectral density and the H/V peaks by comparison with the results obtained through a commercial seismic recorder. The obtained results show the applicability of the developed acquisition system to record seismic noise and to apply the H/V method. Geophonino-3D is an open source and open hardware system and the price of its components is much lower than any other commercial equipment, which becomes a significant advance especially for small research groups with reduced economic support.

The EyeTrackers and Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs) are suitable systems for those people but their main drawback is their cost. More affordable devices are capable of detecting voluntary blinks and translating them into a binary signal that allows the selection, for example, of an ideogram on a communication board. We tested four different systems based on infrared, bioelectrical signals (Electro-Oculography (EOG) and Electro-Encephalography (EEG)), and video processing. The experiments were performed by people with/without disabilities and analyzed the systems' performances, usability, and method of voluntary blinking (long blinks or sequence of two short blinks). The best accuracy (99.3%) was obtained using Infrared-Oculography (IR-OG) and the worst with the EEG headset (85.9%) and there was a statistical influence of the technology on accuracy. Regarding the method of voluntary blinking, the use of long or double blinks had no statistical influence on accuracy, excluding EOG, and the time taken to perform double blinks was shorter, resulting in a potentially much faster interface. People with disabilities obtained similar values but with greater variability. The preferred technology and blinking methods were Video-Oculography (VOG) and long blinks, respectively.

The high -resolution scaffolds produced by MEW have been primarily used for tissue engineering, cancer research, bio-fabrication and biomaterials. Unfortunately, the commercial MEW device's prohibitive affordability and lack of standardization of custom devices, represent obstacles to further research. Built on the achievements and affordability of material extrusion 3D printers, we convert an open-source Voron 0.1 printer into a highly capable MEW device, termed as MEWron. To guarantee availability, the use of commercial and affordable components is prioritized, while in the cases where this has not been possible, 3D printed, and easy-to-machine components have been employed. Two main approaches have been followed, the first one focused on the existing material extrusion configuration (i.e., filament-based feeding system and material input) while the second one focuses on a conventional MEW pneumatic feeding system and syringe reservoir. When not including the high voltage supply, both approaches have a final budget below $1000. The manuscript describes all required steps and components to modify a Voron 0.1 printer and provides the computer-aided design (CAD) for required custom components reproduction. Moreover, the MEWron devices' reliability is demonstrated, as well as their potential to extend the MEW field boundaries.

The horizontal-to-vertical spectral ratio technique calculates the resonant frequency of the soil just by using a single three-component sensor. Array measurements require at least several vertical sensors registering simultaneously and their analysis provides an estimation of the surface waves dispersion curve. Although these methods are relatively cheaper than other geotechnical techniques, the cost of the sensors and the multi-channel data acquisition system means that small research groups cannot afford this kind of equipment. In this work, two prototypes for registering seismic noise have been developed and implemented: a three-channel acquisition system, optimized for working with three-component sensors; and a twelve-channel acquisition system, prepared for working simultaneously with twelve vertical geophones. Both prototypes are characterized by being open-hardware, open-software, easy to implement, and low-cost. The main aim is to provide a data acquisition system that can be reproduced and applied by any research group.

The device can capture bright-field microscopic images by using a low-cost CMOS image sensor, an inverted varifocal CCTV lens and an array of light emitting diodes. In addition, by developed two-axial movement stage and image augmenting algorithms, the whole area of a user selectable well (e.g. area of a 6.5 mm diameter well in a 96-well plate) can be automatically imaged without using any other third party software.

This prototype device employs 18 unique angular measurement positions and a variety of user-selectable LED light sources. The motivation for this project was the need to generate more parameter-rich data sets pertaining to the light-scattering properties of natural sediment suspensions, and to address the issues raised by Kitchener et al. (2017) concerning the inconsistent calibration methodologies currently employed to quantify suspended sediment concentration (SSC) by optical turbidity measurement. The mechanical design comprises re-purposed waste plastic materials and 3D-printed parts. The active light-source control and monitoring hardware and firmware executes on the open-source Arduino embedded microcontroller platform. The modular light sensors plug into any of the angular measurement positions, providing a 0-5 V nominal output signal, which is readable by the user's choice of data-acquisition system. The device will facilitate the highly detailed characterization of suspended sediment samples, providing 18 voltage output channels for analysis by the user. The precise calibration of the light sensors is by the use of neutral density (ND) filters in conjunction with light-source electrical current measurements, providing light-source intensity values as required. The empirical data provided by existing turbidity meters are acquired using incommensurate methodologies, and therefore they are not cross-comparable. A new methodology, described here, facilitates the cross-comparability of turbidity measurements. (C) 2019 The Authors.

The illuminated orbital shaker is especially well suited for low-resource research laboratories and education. It is an alternative to commercial instruments for microalgae cultivation. It improves on typical do-it-yourself microalgae growth systems by offering consistent and well characterized illumination light intensity. The illuminated growth area is 20 cm x 15 cm, which is suitable for three T75 tissue culture flasks or six 100 ml Erlenmeyer flasks. The photosynthetic photon flux density, is variable in eight steps (26 - 800 mu mol.m(-2).s(-1)) and programmable in a 24-h light/dark cycle. The agitation speed is variable (0 - 210 RPM). The overall material cost is around 300 pound, including an entry-level orbital shaker. The build takes two days, requiring electronics and mechanical assembly capabilities. The instrument build is documented in a set of open-source protocols, design files, and source code. The design can be readily modified, scaled, and adapted for other orbital shakers and specific experimental requirements.

An important direction of research has been to decompose an arbitrary entangled state, represented as a unitary, into a quantum circuit, that is, a sequence of gates supported by a quantum processor. It has been well known that circuits with longer decompositions and more entangling multi-qubit gates are error-prone for the current noisy, intermediate-scale quantum devices. To this end, there has been a significant interest to develop heuristic-based methods to discover compact circuits. We contribute to this effort by proposing QuantumCircuitOpt (QCOpt), a novel open-source framework which implements mathematical optimization formulations and algorithms for decomposing arbitrary unitary gates into a sequence of hardware-native gates. A core innovation of QCOpt is that it provides optimality guarantees on the quantum circuits that it produces. In particular, we show that QCOpt can find up to 57% reduction in the number of necessary gates on circuits with up to four qubits, and in run times less than a few minutes on commodity computing hardware. We also validate the efficacy of QCOpt as a tool for quantum circuit design in comparison with a naive brute-force enumeration algorithm. We also show how the QCOpt package can be adapted to various built-in types of native gate sets, based on different hardware platforms like those produced by IBM, Rigetti and Google. We hope this package will facilitate further algorithmic exploration for quantum processor designers, as well as quantum physicists.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,1693,,,

In this paper, we propose strategies for the placement of CU and DU network functions in the regional and edge O-Cloud nodes while jointly associating the users to RUs. The aim is to minimize the end-to-end delay of users and minimize the cost of O-RAN deployment. Thus, we first formulate the end-to-end delay, the cost, and the constraints. We then model the problem as a multi-objective optimization problem The optimization formulation consists of a huge number of constraints and variables. To provide a solution to the problem, we develop the corresponding Markov Decision Problem (MDP) and propose a Deep Q-Network (DQN)-based algorithm.

This study develops a distributed manufacturing solution using only an open source manufacturing tool chain consisting of two types of open source 3-D printing and batch UV curing, and provides a parametric fully free design of a nasopharyngeal swab. The swab was designed using parametric OpenSCAD in two components (a head with engineered break point and various handles), which has several advantages: i) minimizing print time on relatively slow SLA printers, ii) enabling the use of smaller print volume open source SLA printers, iii) reducing the amount of relatively expensive UV resin, and iv) enabling production of handle on more accessible material extrusion 3-D printers. A modular open source UV LED box was designed, fabricated for $45 and tested for batch curing. Swabs can be fabricated for $0.06-$0.12/swab. The results of the mechanical validation tests showed that the swabs could withstand greater forces than would be expected in normal clinical use.

By integrating the precision balance as an Internet of Things (IoT) device, it gains the ability to provide real-time gravimetric summaries of dispensing, generate timely alerts when problems are detected, and capture historical dispensing data for future analysis. All collected data can then be accessed via a web interface for reviewing alerts and dispensing information in real time or remotely for timely intervention of dispense errors.

The proposed system measures temperature, dissolved oxygen, and pH, taking records and sending information through a wireless protocol (ZigBee) to a graphical user interface which can display information numerically and graphically, as well as simultaneously storing the information in a database. These variables are very important for aquaculture, as they have a direct influence on critical culture parameters such as growth and survival.

IoT devices are mainly powered by low-cost microcontrollers (MCUs) that typically lack basic hardware security mechanisms to separate security-critical applications from less critical components. Recently, Arm has started to release Cortex-M MCUs enhanced with TrustZone technology (i.e., TrustZone-M), a system-wide security solution aiming at providing robust protection for IoT devices. Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) relying on TrustZone hardware have been perceived as safe havens for securing mobile devices. However, for the past few years, considerable effort has gone into unveiling hundreds of vulnerabilities and proposing a collection of relevant defense techniques to address several issues. While new TEE solutions built on TrustZone-M start flourishing, the lessons gathered from the research community appear to be falling short, as these new systems are trapping into the same pitfalls of the past. In this paper, we present uTango, the first multi-world TEE for modern IoT devices. uTango proposes a novel architecture aiming at tackling the major architectural deficiencies currently affecting TrustZone(-M)-assisted TEEs. In particular, we leverage the very same TrustZone hardware primitives used by dual-world implementations to create multiple and equally secure execution environments within the normal world. We demonstrate the benefits of uTango by conducting an extensive evaluation on a real TrustZone-M hardware platform, i.e., Arm Musca-B1. uTango will be open-sourced and freely available on GitHub in hopes of engaging academia and industry on securing the foreseeable trillion IoT devices.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,1715,,,

Having access to education and the means of production appears as the major factors for the implementation of this goal. 3D printing is a revolutionary technology that has the potential to bring digital manufacturing to everyone. However, the rise of personal fabrication requires an increase in printing quality, a reduction on machine cost and an increase in knowledge shared by the open hardware community. The purpose of this paper is to explore the development of a new Open Hardware printer project to address these points. Design/methodology/approach - The authors have designed and constructed a low-cost photopolymer-based 3D printer called BeamMaker. The printer is connected to a host computer and a digital-light-processing projector. This work details the design process and how improvements were implemented to reach good printing quality. The authors provide public access to the instructions, software, source code, parts list, user manual and STL and CAD files. Findings - The BeamMaker printer can build objects with a high surface quality that is comparable to the quality obtained by industrial photopolymer-based 3D printers. When testing the ability to print a sample cylinder, the printer shows higher accuracy when compared to other personal 3D printers. These findings are encouraging considering the low cost of the system. Research limitations/implications - The printing failure rate of the system has not been measured to date. The system requires some improvements to produce large objects. Practical implications - The printer cost is just USD380. This is five to eight times less expensive than popular personal 3D printers available today. The cost is 30 times less expensive than a personal photopolymer 3D printer produced by a main commercial company and yet producing results of similar quality. The authors expect good avenues for collaboration from the open-source community to continue improving these systems. Social implications - The high cost of current personal 3D printers prevents users from developing countries from entering into the open hardware trend. A dramatic reduction in printer cost such as that explored in this work might contribute to the real democratization of personal fabrication. Originality/value - The authors report on the status of three other photopolymer-based personal 3D printer projects. To the best of the authors' knowledge, BeamMaker is the first fully open hardware 3D printer project which uses this technology.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,1717,,,

It aims at determining a portfolio of ciphers for authenticated encryption that has advantages over AES-GCM in terms of performance, security, and ease of implementation. This competition, for the first time, provides a standardized hardware API, which allows a fair comparison of hardware implementations. However, the community still lacks a common platform to automatically test hardware implementations, confirm implementation claims, and benchmark performance figures on real hardware in terms of runtime, area, power and energy consumption. In this work, we present a common platform using the CAESAR-API in a Xilinx Zynq-7000 System on Chip (SoC) with ARM processors and an AXI interface. This reflects a typical real world usage scenario for hardware-accelerators and thus extends the work for a fair comparison of hardware implementations in three dimensions: first the API is evaluated on a real SoC, which shows, e.g. the performance of the API. Second, it provides a hardware platform to test the proposed implementations of the candidates easily. This can be used by future designers, as we will provide it as open source hardware. Finally, we ran all published hardware implementations of the current 3rd-round candidates during which we identified several implementation weaknesses, e.g. presumably unintended latches in the design, hence emphasizing the importance of testing hardware proposals on real hardware.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,1720,,,

Along with cloud computing, NFV and SDN are moving network functions from dedicated hardware to software implementation (Virtual Network Functions - VNF), on Virtual Machine (VM) or other virtualization technology such as containers, on top of a virtualized platform in the Cloud. To connect the VNFs, hosted in the same Data Center (DC) or across multiple DCs, virtual switches are required. Besides forwarding functions, virtual switches can be configured to mirror traffics for network management needs. Among the existing virtual switch solutions, Open vSwitch (OVS) is the most known and used. OVS is open source, and included in most of the existing Linux distributions. However, OVS performance in terms of throughput for smaller packets is very smaller than of line rate of the interface. To overcome this limitation, OVS was ported to Data Plane Development Kit (DPDK), namely OVDK. The latter achieves an impressive line rate throughput across physical interfaces. In this paper, we present the result of OVDK performance test when flow and port mirroring are activated, which was not tested so far. The performance test focuses on two parameters, throughput and latency in OVDK; allowing to validate the use of OVDK for flow forwarding and network management in the envisioned virtualized network architecture.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,1726,,,

The most concerning threats are hardware trojans. A hardware trojan is a malicious inclusion or alteration to the existing design of an integrated circuit, with the possible effects ranging from leakage of sensitive information to the complete destruction of the integrated circuit itself. While the majority of existing detection schemes focus on test-time, they all require expensive methodologies to detect hardware trojans. Off-the-shelf approaches have often been overlooked due to limited hardware resources and detection accuracy. With the advances in technologies and the democratisation of open-source hardware, however, these tools enable the detection of hardware trojans at reduced costs during or after production. In this manuscript, a hardware trojan is created and emulated on a consumer FPGA board. The experiments to detect the trojan in a dormant and active state are made using off-the-shelf technologies taking advantage of different techniques such as Power Analysis Reports, Side Channel Analysis and Thermal Measurements. Furthermore, multiple attempts to detect the trojan are demonstrated and benchmarked.

With few exceptions, such test systems are discontinuous. They require exposure of the biological test material in small units, such as multiwell plates, during prolonged incubation periods, and do not allow online read-outs. It is mostly due to these shortcomings that applications in continuous monitoring of, e.g., drinking or surface water quality are largely missing. We propose the use of pipetting robots that can be used to automatically exchange samples in multiwell plates with fresh samples in a semi-static manner, as a potential solution to overcome these limitations. In this study, we developed a simple and low-cost, versatile pipetting robot constructed partly using open source hardware that has a small footprint and can be used for online monitoring of water quality by means of an automated whole-organism bioassay. We tested its precision in automated 2-fold dilution series and used it for exposure of zebrafish embryos (Danio rerio) a common model species in ecotoxicology to cadmium chloride and permethrin. We found that, compared to conventional static or semi-static exposure scenarios, effects of the two chemicals in zebrafish embryos generally occurred at lower concentrations, and analytically verified that the increased frequency of media exchange resulted in a greater availability of the chemical. In combination with advanced detection systems this custom-made pipetting robot has the potential to become a valuable tool in future monitoring strategies for drinking and surface water.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,1736,,,

However, such globalization also poses various security threats in each phase of the IC supply chain. Although the advancements of Machine Learning (ML) have pushed the frontier of hardware security, most conventional ML-based methods can only achieve the desired performance by manually finding a robust feature representation for circuits that are non-Euclidean data. As a result, modeling these circuits using graph learning to improve design flows has attracted research attention in the Electronic Design Automation (EDA) field. However, due to the lack of supporting tools, only a few existing works apply graph learning to resolve hardware security issues. To attract more attention, we propose HW2VEC, an open-source graph learning tool that lowers the threshold for newcomers to research hardware security applications with graphs. HW2VEC provides an automated pipeline for extracting a graph representation from a hardware design in various abstraction levels (register transfer level or gate-level netlist). Besides, HW2VEC users can automatically transform the non-Euclidean hardware designs into Euclidean graph embeddings for solving their problems. In this paper, we demonstrate that HW2VEC can achieve state-of-the-art performance on two hardware security-related tasks: Hardware Trojan Detection and Intellectual Property Piracy Detection.

Since it is the most labor-intensive stage in the nearly all-analytical protocols, sample preparation automation would be desirable, to increase the analytical throughput, maintaining precision and accuracy, while preventing risks of human exposure to chemical or biological agents. Among different lab-automation strategies, robots have long been an important prospect. Nevertheless, widespread adoption of dedicate ""robot-chemist"" with analytical purposes continues being limited. Open resources that enable non-specialist analysts and researchers to make their own prototypes are still necessary. We have assembled an open-source innovative platform, able to guarantee the online hyphenation of the sample preparation microtechniques with liquid chromatography, mass spectrometry or any other detection system. It is a multi-purpose cartesian robot, programmed to perform sample clean-up operations, allowing the automated pre-concentration of analytes through the performance of solid and liquid phase microextraction protocols, actuating a microextraction syringe driver, and equipped with an in-syringe-stirring mechanism and an adapted interface for online coupling with liquid chromatography or mass spectrometry analysis. The entire sample preparation procedure can be performed by the developed prototype and the enriched extract automatically injected into the separation and detection system. The analytical performance of the developed prototype was assessed for the extraction of polyaromatic hydrocarbons from sewage water, by headspace dynamic single drop microextraction (SDME), dynamic hollow-fiber liquid phase microextraction (HF-LPME) and microextraction by packed sorbent (MEPS). The developed prototype displayed excellent precision and accuracy for the execution of the microextraction protocols, proving to be a promising and competitive open source analytical tool able to extend the state-of-the-art of sample preparation microtechniques.

To assess the potential of autonomous low-cost UAVs for the mapping and monitoring of alpine glaciers, we conducted multiple aerial surveys on the Kanderfirn in the Swiss Alps in 2017 and 2018 using open hardware and software of the Paparazzi UAV project. The open-source photogrammetry software OpenDroneMap was tested for the generation of high-resolution orthophotos and digital surface models (DSMs) from aerial imagery and cross-checked with the well-established proprietary software Pix4D. Accurately measured ground control points served for the determination of the geometric accuracy of the orthophotos and DSMs. A horizontal (xy) accuracy of 0.7-1.2 m and a vertical (z) accuracy of 0.7-2.1 m was achieved for OpenDroneMap, compared to a xy-accuracy of 0.3-0.5 m and a z-accuracy of 0.4-0.5 m obtained for Pix4D. Based on the analysis and comparison of different orthophotos and DSMs, surface elevation, roughness and brightness changes from 3 June to 29 September 2018 were quantified. While the brightness of the glacier surface decreased linearly over the ablation season, the surface roughness increased. The mean DSM-based elevation change across the glacier tongue was 8 m, overestimating the measured melting and surface lowering at the installed ablation stakes by about 1.5 m. The presented results highlight that self-built fixed-wing UAVs in tandem with open-source photogrammetry software are an affordable alternative to commercial remote-sensing platforms and proprietary software.

In this work, we present PERCIVAL, an application-level posit RISC-V core based on CVA6 that can execute all posit instructions, including the quire fused operations. This solves the obstacle encountered by previous works, which only included partial posit support or which had to emulate posits in software. In addition, Xposit, a RISC-V extension for posit instructions is incorporated into LLVM. Therefore, PERCIVAL is the first work that integrates the complete posit instruction set in hardware. These elements allow for the native execution of posit instructions as well as the standard floating-point ones, further permitting the comparison of these representations. FPGA and ASIC synthesis show the hardware cost of implementing 32-bit posits and highlight the significant overhead of including a quire accumulator. However, results show that the quire enables a more accurate execution of dot products. In general matrix multiplications, the accuracy error is reduced up to 4 orders of magnitude. Furthermore, performance comparisons show that these accuracy improvements do not hinder their execution, as posits run as fast as single-precision floats and exhibit better timing than double-precision floats, thus potentially providing an alternative representation.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,1768,,,

Free and open source software and firmware are developed to operate the tool. The OS4PP was validated against a wide range of discrete resistors and indium tin oxide (ITO) samples of different thicknesses both pre- and post-annealing. The OS4PP was then compared to two commercial proprietary systems. Results of resistors from 10 to 1 M show errors of less than 1% for the OS4PP. The 3-D mapping of sheet resistance of ITO samples successfully demonstrated the automated capability to measure non-uniformities in large-area samples. The results indicate that all measured values are within the same order of magnitude when compared to two proprietary measurement systems. In conclusion, the OS4PP system, which costs less than 70% of manual proprietary systems, is comparable electrically while offering automated 100 micron positional accuracy for measuring sheet resistance over larger areas.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,1777,,,

This work enables accurate, hardware-validated performance, power, and energy modelling of CPUs by first presenting a methodology to evaluate and identify sources of error in CPU performance models, and secondly developing empirical power models optimised for use with such performance models. Hierarchical clustering, correlation analysis, and regression techniques are used to identify sources of error without requiring detailed CPU specifications and enable existing models to be improved, new models to be developed, validation of simulator changes, and testing of model suitability for specific use-cases. Furthermore, the GemStone open-source software tool is presented, which automates the process of characterising hardware platforms, identifying sources of error in gem5 models, applying power analysis, and quantifying the effect of errors on the performance, power, and energy estimations. In addition, the mean percentage error in execution time was found to swing from -51% to +10% between two versions of the same gem5 model, underlining the need for an automated tool to validate models against reference hardware, ensuring accuracy and consistency.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,1782,,,

A challenge to using FPGAs is the complex computer-aided design flow required to efficiently map a computation onto an FPGA. Traditionally, these design flows are closed-source and highly specialized to a particular vendor's devices. We propose an alternate data-driven approach, which uses highly adaptable and retargettable open-source tools to target both commercial and research FPGA architectures.

Parametric design using a solid modeling programming language allows customization and provides a source file for the design. OpenSCAD is the most widely used scripting tool for parametric modeling of open source labware. However, OpenSCAD lacks the ability to export to standard parametric formats; thus, the parametric dimensional information of the model is lost. This is an important deficiency because it is key to share the design in the most accessible formats with no information loss. In this work we analyze OpenSCAD and compare it with FreeCAD Python scripts. We have created a parametric open source hardware design to compare these tools. Our findings show that although Python for FreeCAD is more arduous to learn, its advantages counterbalance the initial difficulties. The main benefits are being able to export to standard parametric models; using Python language with its libraries; and the ability to use and integrate the models in its graphical interface.

Traditionally, the volume of such measurements has been limited by the high cost of commercially available instruments. An increasingly attractive solution to this cost issue is to use instruments produced in-house from open-source hardware, firmware, and postprocessing building blocks. In the present work, we release the next iteration of our open-source drifter and wave-monitoring instrument, which follows these solution aspects. The new design is significantly less expensive (typically by a factor of 5 compared with our previous, already cost-effective instrument), much easier to build and assemble for people without specific microelectronics and programming competence, more easily extendable and customizable, and two orders of magnitude more power-efficient (to the point where solar panels are no longer needed even for long-term deployments). Improving performance and reducing noise levels and costs compared with our previous generation of instruments is possible in large part thanks to progress from the electronics component industry. As a result, we believe that this will allow scientists in geosciences to increase by an order of magnitude the amount of in situ data they can collect under a constant instrumentation budget. In the following, we offer (1) a detailed overview of our hardware and software solution, (2) in situ validation and benchmarking of our instrument, (3) a fully open-source release of both hardware and software blueprints. We hope that this work, and the associated open-source release, will be a milestone that will allow our scientific fields to transition towards open-source, community-driven instrumentation. We believe that this could have a considerable impact on many fields by making in situ instrumentation at least an order of magnitude less expensive and more customizable than it has been for the last 50 years, marking the start of a new paradigm in oceanography and polar science, where instrumentation is an inexpensive commodity and in situ data are easier and less expensive to collect.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,1796,,,

We used hippocampal theta oscillations as system input, and electrical stimulation in the mesencephalic reticular formation (mRt) as controller output. It is well documented that hippocampal theta oscillations are highly related to locomotion, while electrical stimulation in the mRt induces freezing. We used an Arduino open-source microcontroller between input and output sources. This allowed us to use hippocampal local field potentials (LFPs) to steer electrical stimulation in the mRt. Our results showed that closed-loop DBS significantly suppressed locomotion compared to no stimulation, and required on average only 56% of the stimulation used in open-loop DBS to reach similar effects. The main advantages of open-source hardware include wide selection and availability, high customizability, and affordability.

VeriGOOD-ML uses three approaches to build ML hardware: the TABLA platform uses a dataflow architecture that is well suited to non-DNN ML algorithms; the GeneSys platform, with a systolic array and a SIMD array, is optimized for implementing DNNs; and the Axiline approach synthesizes small ML algorithms by hardcoding the structure of the algorithm into hardware, thus trading off flexibility for performance and power. The overall approach explores the design space of platform configurations and Pareto-optimal-PPA back-end implementations to yield designs that represent different tradeoffs at the algorithmic level between area, power, performance, and execution time.

The optical performance of the instrument was calibrated in the laboratory using a calibration target and preserved zooplankton. The IPAX was then deployed in the field to observe diversity, emergent patterns and phototactic behaviour of demersal zooplankton at night to demonstrate its practicality. Laboratory calibration indicated that the IPAX can resolve 100 mu m features with 70% contrast at the focal plane with 5 cm x 3 cm field of view and 5 mm depth of field. The instrument also resolved fine morphological details of preserved zooplankton when in focus. The field deployment demonstrated capability to resolve the myriad of zooplankton present in addition to the different phototactic behaviour that was elicited and observed from the different colour LEDs.

The diversity of applications and protocols and the custom needs for each environment introduce a big challenge for IoT applications, demanding the support of communication and message exchanges in implementations that aggregate diverse protocols. The paper addresses the design of an open-source multiprotocol gateway which supports two communication protocols, namely, Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) and LoRa. The proposed gateway represents the bridge between the devices and the network server and transports the received messages via a standard format readable by the network server. The messages between the gateway and the network server are transported over the Message Queuing Telemetry Transport (MQTT) protocol. The paper details the implementation of the proposed multi-protocol gateway and highlights its benefits. In particular, the proposed gateway demonstrates support for multiple protocols on the same hardware base and eliminates the need of using multiple hardware components for each type of protocol.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,1821,,,

This ""Do-It-Yourself"" interface comprised a 1.0 mx0.25 mm segment of MTX-5 metallic column and a low-cost DC power supply. Thermal desorption modulation (TDM) was attained using a dual-stage heater-based modulator in a novel segmented-loop configuration. TDM was achieved by alternating analyte trapping and thermal desorption. Former process relied on analyte partition to sorbent phase, while latter explored direct resistive heating. Introduction of an intermediate delay segment between the two stages mitigated analyte breakthrough, improving peak symmetry and chromatographic efficiency. This feature was critical to acquire reliable GCxGC modulation using such simple heater-based device. The effects of important modulation variables on 2D separations were investigated, including TDM stage length, dimension of delay loop, and outlet pressure. Significant advances and limitations of proposed TDM strategy were carefully determined. Proposed GCxGC prototype by using an in-oven TDM modulator was successfully applied to a series of challenging matrices, including petroleum distillates, biodiesel, and essential oil. This open-hardware, cost-effective modulator was easy to install and operate, as it circumvented the need for sophisticated components (e.g. moving parts and cooling systems). Therefore, our modulator is a compelling alternative to existing GCxGC solutions to operate in resource-limited laboratories.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,1827,,,

With the growing paradigm on do-it-yourself (DIY) biology and open-source (OS) hardware, there are many efforts to create microfluidic products by using publicly-shared or easy-to-use principles. Although this approach to technology innovation has already been initiated in the field of microfluidics, the literature on OS and DIY microfluidics is still disseminated in individual journals. In this review, we provide an overview of OS and DIY microfluidics and related technologies, in particular, how microfluidic devices can be fabricated without specialized manufacturing equipment and microfabrication facilities, and how laboratory equipment that is required to perform microfluidics research can be recreated to be affordable and customizable without specialized expertise. Thus, this review introduces subtractive and additive micromachining technologies such as laser cutting, milling, and 3D printing that are accessible even to beginners, and compare their pros and cons for microfabrication. Then, OS and DIY instruments essential for operation of microfluidic devices including precision pumps, microscopes, and centrifuges are reviewed.

It is, however, a challenge to write programs that allow interactive use of such arrangements from a personal computer. This task is particularly complex if some of the included hardware components are connected directly to the computer and not via the microcontroller. A graphical user interface framework, Instrumentino, was therefore developed to allow the creation of control programs for complex systems with minimal programming effort.

Energy storage will be needed to take full advantage of abundant but intermittent energy sources. Even with economies of scale, the price is prohibitively high for a lithium-ion battery pack capable of storing tens of kilowatts of energy for many consumers. A more abundant and less expensive material is necessary. All-iron chemistry presents a transformative opportunity for stationary energy storage: it is simple, cheap, abundant, and safe. All-iron batteries can store energy by reducing iron (II) to metallic iron at the anode and oxidizing iron (II) to iron (III) at the cathode. The total cell is highly stable, efficient, non-toxic, and safe. The total cost of materials is $0.1 per watt-hour of capacity at wholesale prices. This battery may be a useful component of open source hardware projects that require a safe and ecologically friendly battery. This is also one of the few battery chemistries that can be built safely in a DIY setting. (C) 2019 The Authors.

Notably, many open research questions regarding the extraction of functionally correct netlists from Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) or Application Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs) have been tackled. In order to facilitate further analysis of recovered netlists, a software framework is required, serving as the foundation for specialized algorithms.

All these requirements cannot be achieved by using software-only solutions, but rather with hardware-based platforms such as NetFPGA. The main obstacle when using this type of open source FPGA-based solution is the cost of development, in both time and hardware development skills required. The spread of new circuit synthesis tools using high-level languages opens the door for the development of hardware-based networking applications with reasonable development effort, compared to the use of traditional hardware description languages. In this article, we describe how existing open source hardware-based platforms for networking applications will be fueled by the change in the programming model of FPGAs provided by modern high-level synthesis tools.

However, extracting calcium signals from raw videos is a computationally complex problem and remains a bottleneck for many researchers utilizing single-photon in vivo calcium imaging. Despite the existence of many powerful analysis packages designed to detect and extract calcium dynamics, most have either key parameters that are hard-coded or insufficient step-by-step guidance and validations to help the users choose the best parameters. This makes it difficult to know whether the output is reliable and meets the assumptions necessary for proper analysis. Moreover, large memory demand is often a constraint for setting up these pipelines since it limits the choice of hardware to specialized computers. Given these difficulties, there is a need for a low memory demand, user-friendly tool offering interactive visualizations of how altering parameters at each step of the analysis affects data output. Our open-source analysis pipeline, Minian (Miniscope Analysis), facilitates the transparency and accessibility of single-photon calcium imaging analysis, permitting users with little computational experience to extract the location of cells and their corresponding calcium traces and deconvolved neural activities. Minian contains interactive visualization tools for every step of the analysis, as well as detailed documentation and tips on parameter exploration. Furthermore, Minian has relatively small memory demands and can be run on a laptop, making it available to labs that do not have access to specialized computational hardware.

Those parameters are assessed objectively with commercial instrumentation such as computer‚Äêassisted sperm analysis systems (CASA) and hemocytometer. In CASA systems, sperm motility is assessed in the horizontal plane imposed by the stage of the microscope. Thus, there is lack of measurement of the vertical velocity of sperm. The female reproductive tract is a tridimensional space which the sperm traverse to reach the ovum, and there is a need for instruments measuring parameters more relevant to this real‚Äêworld situation. In this report we describe the design, construction and use of an open‚Äêsource hardware (OSH) device for evaluation of the vertical velocity of sperm, called UPSPERM. This device was also used to measure sperm concentration, and agreement with hemocytometer was evaluated. Bland‚ÄìAltman analysis shows good agreement between these two methods of sperm counting. As a first application of UPSPERM, we evaluated the changes in boar sperm motility at distinct pH values between 7.0 and 8.0. The UPSPERM results showed that the vertical velocity of sperm was highest at pH¬†7.6 and 7.8.

For bringing this technology to AEC classrooms, an open-source TLS was developed. The physical model was built using digital fabrication, its connectivity was established using accessible, affordable, open-source sensors and actuators and its digital representation was developed using generative design tools. All elements together are synchronized in real-time and the TLS becomes live, digitally twinned, geometry generator. The points that are generated by the TLS are gathered in a 3D virtual space in the form of virtual points. The present digitally twinned vision of laser scanning has thus three identified educational uses: (i) illustration of the measuring principle using open-source hardware together with mathematics and statistics, (ii) illustration of the generation and visualization of point clouds in real-time within a CAD environment, and (iii) perhaps with a vaster scope in AEC classrooms, illustration of the usage, analysis and identification of these point clouds. The development of this tool belongs to a vaster project for infusing Construction 4.0 technologies in AEC classrooms under development in xxxxxxxxxxxxx.

The goal of this work was to develop a simple (single-piece and single-layer photolithography) sperm counting chamber (SSCC) for aquatic species. Goldfish (Carassius auratus) and zebrafish (Danio rerio) sperm were used for evaluation in the device, which was created with soft lithography. Four designs with different geometries were evaluated for counting accuracy. Open-corner and open-midpoint designs were the most accurate with no significant differences (P > 0.05) for most of the target sperm concentrations (0.5-1.0 x 10(8) cells/mL). The open-corner design was not significantly different from the Makler (R) counting chamber intended for human sperm cells (P = 0.6) but was significantly different from a hemocytometer (P < 0.001) intended for other cell sizes. Material cost of device production was USD 16 per unit, including photolithography supplies, glass slide and coverslip, and polydimethylsiloxane. The cost can be reduced to USD 2 per unit with repeated wafer casts.

Realizing this, we developed a fluorescence-based point-of-care (fPOC) detection system with real-time reverse transcriptase loop-mediated isothermal amplification for rapid and quantitative detection of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus. The system is built based on the Arduino platform compatible with commercially available open-source hardware-software and off-the-shelf electronic components. The fPOC system comprises of three main components: 1) an instrument with integrated heaters, 2) optical detection components, and 3) an injection-molded polymeric cartridge. The system was tested and experimentally proved to be able to use for fast detection of the SARS-CoV-2 virus in real-time in less than 30 min. Preliminary results of testing the performance of the fPOC revealed that the fPOC could detect the SARS-CoV-2 virus at a limit of detection (LOD50%) at two to three copies/microliter (15.36 copies/reaction), which was comparable to reactions run on a standard commercial thermocycler. The performance of the fPOC was evaluated with 12 SARS-CoV-2 clinical throat swab samples that included seven positive and five negative samples, as confirmed by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. The fPOC showed 100% agreement with the commercial thermocycler.

Yet in much of the developing world, prohibitive costs are a substantial barrier to universal access. One area where this is clear is surgical fracture tables, which generally cost >US$200,000 new. With the advent of 3-D printing, a new way to reduce medical equipment costs is to use open source hardware licensed designs to fabricate digitally-distributed manufactured medical hardware. That approach is applied here to make surgical tables more accessible. This study describes the design and manufacture of an open source surgical fracture table that uses materials that are widely available worldwide with specialty components being 3-D printed. The bill of materials and assembly instructions are detailed and the fracture table is validated to perform mechanically to specifications. Using an open source desktop RepRap-class 3-D printer, the components can be printed in a little over a week of continuous printing. Including the 3-D printed parts, the open source fracture table can be constructed for under US$3,000 in material costs, representing a 98.5% savings for commercial systems, radically increasing accessibility. The open source table can be adjusted 90-116 cm in height, tilted from +/-15 degrees, the leg height ranges from 31 to 117 cm, the arm supports and foot holder both have a 180-degree range, the foot position has a 54 cm range, and the legs can be adjusted from 55 to 120 degrees. It is mechanically adjusted so does not require electricity, however, surgical staff need to be trained on how to perform needed adjustments during surgery. The open source surgical table has verified performance for mechanical loading over 130 kg, geometric flexibility to allow for wide array of common surgeries, is radiolucent in surgical zones, and is modular and upgradeable.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,1901,,,

More people than ever-from artists, makers and entrepreneurs to educators and students-are connecting microcontrollers with sensors and actuators to create new interactive devices. However, physical computing still presents many challenges and demands many skills, spanning electronics, low-level protocols, and software-road blocks that reduce participation. While USB has made connecting peripherals to a personal computing device (PC) trivial, USB components are expensive and require a PC to operate. This makes USB impractical for many physical computing scenarios where cost, size and low power operation are often important. We introduce Jacdac, an open-source hardware and software platform that brings the user experience of USB to physical computing at a fraction of the cost and resource requirements. It combines an intuitive connector, standardized hardware and software interfaces, a simple bus-based protocol that runs on virtually any microcontroller, and integration with Microsoft MakeCode for the micro:bit. In this way, Jacdac provides a low-cost, extensible web-based plug-and-play experience for physical computing. We evaluated Jacdac in an international hackathon involving over 80 participants who built functional artifacts with Jacdac.

These limitations include the need for more effective communication between computers and peripheral devices and more flexibility for fast settings under specific protocols for neurophysiological data. This paper describes a flexible and scalable OpenBCI framework for electroencephalographic (EEG) data experiments using the Cyton acquisition board with updated drivers to maximize the hardware benefits of ADS1299 platforms. The framework handles distributed computing tasks and supports multiple sampling rates, communication protocols, free electrode placement, and single marker synchronization. As a result, the OpenBCI system delivers real-time feedback and controlled execution of EEG-based clinical protocols for implementing the steps of neural recording, decoding, stimulation, and real-time analysis. In addition, the system incorporates automatic background configuration and user-friendly widgets for stimuli delivery. Motor imagery tests the closed-loop BCI designed to enable real-time streaming within the required latency and jitter ranges.

We propose an intuitive yet elegant design for a 3D-printed digital pipette designed for robots to carry out chemical experiments. It costs less than 200 USD, and the simple design with three parts enables a new user to assemble one in 10 minutes. We conducted a performance evaluation that closely followed ISO 8655-6. Our results show that robots with the digital pipette could conduct accurate liquid delivery with 0.2% random error for the nominal volume (10 mL). This performance is comparable to commercially available liquid handling devices, whose typical random errors are 0.3%. We propose an economical 3D-printed pipette, which aims to overcome the limitations of two-finger robot grippers. It enables general-purpose robot arms to achieve high precision in liquid transfer tasks that is comparable to commercial devices.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,1906,,,

Nonetheless, the costs and issues regarding their implementation and deployment limit the access of the students and educators to their advantages and features such as technical and educational. In this line, this study describes a fully open-source remote laboratory in hardware and software for education in automatic control systems employing Raspberry Pi and Python language with an approximate cost of USD 461. Even, by changing some components, the cost can be reduced to USD 420 or less. To illustrate the functionalities of the labora-tory, we proposed a low-cost tank control system with its respective instrumentation, sig-nal conditioning, identification, and control, which are exposed in this document. However, other experiments can be easily scalable and adaptable to the remote laboratory. Concerning the interface of the laboratory, we designed a complete user-friendly web interface with real-time video for the users to perform the different activities in automatic control such as identification or controller implementation through the programming lan-guage Python. The instructions to build and replicate the hardware and software are indi-cated in the open repositories provided for the project as well as in this paper. Our intention with this project is to offer a complete low-cost and open-source remote labora-tory that can be adapted and used for the students, educators, and stakeholders to learn, experiment, and teach in the field of automatic control systems.

However, RES power inverters affect power quality, increase power losses, and, in certain cases, may cause power interruptions due to harmonics, deterioration of the rate of change of frequency, and inability to rapidly react in grid faults. Today, phasor measurement units (PMUs) are the ultimate tools for real-time monitoring of distribution grids' health, and they enable several data-driven added-value services such as fast and automated fault detection, isolation, and recovery; state estimation; power quality monitoring; dynamic events analysis, etc. The present paper proposes an open hardware and software PMU platform, which is low cost, high performance, expandable, and, in general, suitable for research and innovation activities.

Artificial insemination is an essential approach used to establish hybrid lines and for the operation of sperm repositories. The existing mouth-pipetting technique for artificial insemination of live-bearing fishes has not been substantially upgraded since the first implementation in the 1950s. This work developed a low-cost standardized artificial inseminator device (SAID) as open hardware to address issues routinely encountered in insemination by mouth-pipetting, including lack of reproducibility among different users, difficulty in training, and large, unreportable variation in sample volume and pressure during insemination. Community-level enhancements of the SAID prototype could enable standardized insemination with minimal training and facilitate the participation of research communities in the use of cryopreserved genetic resources.

The goal of this work was to develop a standardized artificial inseminator device (SAID) to address issues routinely encountered in insemination by mouth-pipetting, including lack of reproducibility among different users, difficulty in training, and large unreportable variation in sample volume and pressure during insemination. Prototypes of the SAID were designed as relatively inexpensive (<USD 80) open hardware based on commercially available and 3-D printed components to enable broad community access. A linear actuator was used to accurately control the position of a piston for fluid transfer with a standard deviation of <0.1 mm over a 4 mm range of travel. The volume of sample transfer was precisely controlled with a linear relationship (r(2) > 0.99) between the piston position and volume. Pressure generation from eight mouth-pipetting operators and SAID prototypes were assessed by pressure sensors. The pressure control by SAID was superior to that produced by mouth-pipetting, yielding lower pressures (31-483 Pa) and smaller variations (standard deviation <11 Pa). These pressures were sufficient to deliver 1-5 mu L of fluid into female reproductive tracts yet low enough to avoid physical injury to fish. Community-level enhancements of the SAID prototype could enable standardized insemination with minimal training and facilitate the participation of research communities in the use of cryopreserved genetic resources.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,1913,,,

Due to the flexibility of the hardware, firmware, and software architectures, the platform is capable of interfacing with a wide variety of detector modules not only in medical imaging but also in homeland security applications. Analog signals from radiation detectors share similar characteristics-a pulse whose area is proportional to the deposited energy and whose leading edge is used to extract a timing signal. As a result, a generic design method of the platform is adopted for the hardware, firmware, and software architectures and implementations. The analog front-end is hosted on a module called a Detector Board, where each board can filter, combine, timestamp, and process multiple channels independently. The processed data is formatted and sent through a backplane bus to a module called Support Board, where 1 Support Board can host up to eight Detector Board modules. The data in the Support Board, coming from 8 Detector Board modules, can be aggregated or correlated (if needed) depending on the algorithm implemented or runtime mode selected. It is then sent out to a computer workstation for further processing. The number of channels (detector modules), to be processed, mandates the overall OpenPET System Configuration, which is designed to handle up to 1,024 channels using 16-channel Detector Boards in the Standard System Configuration and 16,384 channels using 32-channel Detector Boards in the Large System Configuration.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,1915,,,

In this work, a solution based on open-source hardware and software was implemented instead of choosing a commercial alternative, making the most of inkjet flexibility in terms of inks, substrates, and actuation signal. First, a piezoelectric printhead from MicroFab, driven by an ArduinoDue, was mounted in a 3D printer adapted to ensure precise movement in three dimensions.

However, many individuals with hearing loss are dissatisfied with the quality of modern hearing aids. Amplification is the main method of compensating for hearing loss in modern hearing aids. One common amplification technique is dynamic range compression, which maps audio signals onto a person's hearing range using an amplification curve. However, due to the frequency dependent nature of the human cochlea, compression is often performed independently in different frequency bands. This paper presents a real-time multirate multiband amplification system for hearing aids, which includes a multirate channelizer for separating an audio signal into eleven standard audiometric frequency bands, and an automatic gain control system for accurate control of the steady state and dynamic behavior of audio compression as specified by ANSI standards. The spectral channelizer offers high frequency resolution with low latency of 5.4 ms and about 14x improvement in complexity over a baseline design. Our automatic gain control includes a closed-form solution for satisfying any designated attack and release times for any desired compression parameters.

Here we present Maasi, an affordable alternative that is easy to build and has all functional key features to be used in a wide range of applications. Our design has a price of less than hundred Euros and an assembly time of only two hours. One of the key design principles was to use only 3D printed parts in combination with affordable Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) components [1]. Reducing the complexity we use an electronic speed controller (ESC) with telemetry, to eliminate the need for a rotor position sensor [2]. A touchscreen further improves its usability, thus setting a perfect startpoint for the design of other affordable lab tools. The Maasi project includes different 3D printable substrate holders allowing treatment of formats up to 80 mm in diameter. We furthermore validate the Maasi spin coater by measuring its speed accuracy and performance for coating polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) on glass coverslips for mechanobiological assays.

Methods: Forty-eight cylindrical-shaped specimens (10 x 2 mm) were prepared with a nano-hybrid RBC (Clearfil Majesty ES-2) and randomly divided in four groups according to the experimental staining procedure: G1) static immersion in a staining solution (coffee) (44 +/- 1 degrees C); G2) staining cycling between coffee (44 +/- 1 degrees C) and distilled water (37 +/- 1 degrees C) with an experimental staining machine based on Arduino, an Open Source hardware development platform; G3) staining cycles as in G2 + brushing with a low abrasive toothpaste (Relative Dentin Abrasion RDA = 30) (Elmex Sensitive Professional); G4) staining cycles as in G3, with brushing performed with a very strong abrasive toothpaste (RDA = 90) (Lacult Active). Color parameters were recorded at the baseline (T0) after staining procedures (T1) and repolishing (T2) using a spectrophotometer. Color change ( increment E00) and translucency (TP, CR) were evaluated. Data were statistically analyzed (p < 0.05). Results: For increment E00 after staining, Group 1 showed the highest color change and Group 3 the lowest. All groups were significantly different (p < 0.001) except for Group 2 vs. Group 4; after repolishing, Group 1 was significantly higher than Group 3 (p < 0.001), Group 2 (p < 0.001), and Group 4 (p = 0.003); Group 2 was higher than Group 3 (p < 0.001).

After repolishing, Group 4 was significantly lower than Group 3 (p = 0.008) and Group 2 (p = 0.027). Repolishing procedure significantly reduced color parameters. Conclusions: The investigated staining procedure induced significant differences in color stability and translucency. The use of a very strong abrasive toothpaste (RDA = 90) induced higher color change than a low abrasive one (RDA = 30).

Images captured by the camera trap are instantly labelled by an artificial intelligence model and an 'alert' containing the image label and other metadata is then delivered to the end-user within minutes over the Iridium satellite network. We present results from testing in the Netherlands, Europe, and from a pilot test in a closed-canopy forest in Gabon, Central Africa. All reference materials required to build the system are provided in open-source repositories. Results show the system can operate for a minimum of 3 months without intervention when capturing a median of 17.23 images per day. The median time-difference between image capture and receiving an alert was 7.35 min, though some outliers showed delays of 5-days or more when the system was incorrectly positioned and unable to connect to the Iridium network. We anticipate significant developments in this field and hope that the solutions presented here, and the lessons learned, can be used to inform future advances. New artificial intelligence models and the addition of other sensors such as microphones will expand the system's potential for other, real-time use cases including real-time biodiversity monitoring, wild resource management and detecting illegal human activities in protected areas.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,1926,,,

The target is to adapt open-source 3D printers to be helpful in research lines that use gels, hydrogels, pastes, inks, and bio-inks. Design/methodology/approach This hardware was designed to be compatible with a Graber i3-based 3D printer; nevertheless, it can be easily adapted to other open-source 3D printers. Findings The extrusion head successfully deposits the material during the 3D printing process. It was validated fabricating geometries that include scaffold structures, which are a possible application of bioprinting for tissue engineering. As reported, the extruded filaments allowed the porous samples' structuration. Practical implications This system expands the applications of open-source 3D printers used at the laboratory scale. It enables low-cost access to research areas such as tissue engineering and biofabrication, energy storage devices and food 3D printing. Originality/value The open-source hardware here reported is of simple fabrication, assembly and installation. It uses a Cardan coupling and a three guides system to transfer the stepper motor motion. This approach allows continuous movement transfer to the syringe piston, producing an adequate deposition or retraction. Thus, the effect of misalignments is avoided, considering that these latter can cause skipping steps in the motor, directly affecting the deposition.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,1931,,,

In fact, simple operations, such as mixing liquids or solutions, stirring, heating and sampling to control the reaction course can be easily implemented. The idea of automating the chemical laboratory would have immediate advantages, for example in terms of safety. The operators will be able to remotely control the machines and in case of handling dangerous material or accidents, there would only be damage to the hardware components. Many of the process parameters can also be read with low-cost probes and devices that can be easily interfaced with microprocessors. We include for example, but not limited to, temperature, pH, redox potential, electrochemical measurements in general or the use of probes for specific analytes. In this work we wish to present our liquid sampling station able to control up to 6 reagents and a temperature controlled chemical reactor.

In this work, we aimed to image scanned proton beams with greater flexibility than is provided by previous systems by using an innovative camera triggering solution. The main objective was to synchronize image acquisitions with proton beam deliveries. A 3D detector composed of 3 scientific complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor cameras and a volumetric liquid scintillator (20 x20x 20 cm) were used. We identified relevant signals from the synchrotron beam delivery system to trigger the cameras. These signals were processed using an open hardware microcontroller and monitored using an oscilloscope. We evaluated the camera triggering scheme by comparing the mean signal intensity and standard deviations for triggered versus non-triggered image acquisitions at 5 energies (161.6, 140.9, 124.0, 100.9, and 85.6 MeV) with 50 spots per energy. The performance of the triggering scheme was further investigated by testing the image intensity variability for 5 energies delivered at 9 different location (2 spots/location). We also measured the background signals for different exposure times (1-1000 ms) using both triggered and non-triggered schemes. The mean signal intensity difference between triggered and non-triggered schemes was 10% +/- 0.4% for low SNR (similar to 20 dB). The image intensity variability was within 2%. The background signal intensity varied by only 0.6% from the shortest exposure time (1 ms) to the longest (1 s).

The total construction cost for this rover is less than USD 3000, approximately one-tenth the cost of existing platforms, and it can be built using facilities frequently available at academic institutions (machine shop, 3-D printer, open-source hardware and software). Instrumentation deployed on this rover can be customized; the rover presented in this study was equipped with a dual-frequency GPS receiver and a digital SLR camera for constructing digital elevation models using structure-from-motion (SfM) photogrammetry. We deployed this prototype rover on the Northeast Greenland Ice Stream to map local variations in snow accumulation and surface topography. The rover conducted four autonomous missions based out of the East Greenland Ice-Core Project (EastGRIP) camp during July 2017, measuring surface elevation transects across the hazardous ice-stream shear margins. During these missions, the rover proved capable of driving over 20 km on a single charge with a drawbar pull of 250 N, sufficient to tow instrumentation of up to 100 kg. The rover also acquired photographs that were subsequently used to construct digital elevation models of a site monitored for spatiotemporal variability in snow accumulation, demonstrating adequate stability for high-resolution imaging applications. Due to its low cost, low-power requirements, and simple modular design, mass deployments of this rover design are practicable. Operation of the rover in hazardous areas circumvents the substantial expense and risk to personnel associated with conventional, crewed deployments.

Furthermore, the heating of residential buildings accounts for up to 68% of housing energy consumption. Therefore, it is not surprising that apartment energy consumption and ways to save energy in housing are a popular research topic in Finland. In this paper, two different research areas are introduced: First, a literature survey is presented on the research subjects of energy saving in the area of real estate and housing. The goal is to gain overall knowledge of the current state of energy saving research. The overall conclusion is that knowledge of energy consumption improves efforts toward energy saving. Second, rapid prototyping with off-the-shelf devices and open source software are described. These devices are cheap to install, and a wide range of sensors are available. Consequently, it is important to deal with these topics together. The former studies provide knowledge about the usage of open hardware, open software, and open architectures with the development of prototype systems for gathering data.

It was developed by the disordered materials group in the British spallation neutron source (ISIS) in 1980s, and aims to construct the most-probable atomic structures of disordered materials in the field of chemical physics. It has been extensively used during the past decades, and has generated reliable results. However, it implements a shared-memory architecture with open multi-processing (OpenMP). With the extensive construction of supercomputer clusters and the widespread use of graphics processing unit (GPU) acceleration technology, it is now possible to rebuild the EPSR with these techniques in the effort to improve its calculation speed. In this study, an open source framework NeuDATool is proposed. It is programmed in the object-oriented language C++, can be paralleled across nodes within a computer cluster, and supports GPU acceleration. The performance of NeuDATool has been tested with water and amorphous silica neutron scattering data. The test shows that the software can reconstruct the correct microstructure of the samples, and the calculation speed with GPU acceleration can increase by more than 400 times, compared with CPU serial algorithm at a simulation box that has about 100 thousand atoms. NeuDATool provides another choice to implement simulation in the (neutron) diffraction community, especially for experts who are familiar with C++ programming and want to define specific algorithms for their analysis.",https://pubs.aip.org/cps/cjcp/article-pdf/33/6/727/18112678/727_1_1674-0068_cjcp2005077.pdf,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,1952,,,

Between crops, weeds are typically controlled by applying herbicides or tillage to the entire field. However, these control methods are expensive and can pose environmental risks. Robotic weeding systems are a good solution to minimize environmental impact and save money on herbicides, but they are expensive (>$100,000). The Weed Warden is a low-cost (<$200) plant detection sensor that can be mounted on rovers or tractors. The Weed Warden uses an open source multispectral sensor to detect live vegetation and sends a logic signal that could trigger a weed removal system such as a sprayer or mechanical tillage when vegetation is detected. We evaluate the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Enhanced Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (ENDVI), and Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI), for producing a value that, combined with a calibrated threshold, will indicate if there is plant life under the sensor. The Weed Warden system using ENDVI is most consistent at detection, with the ability to discriminate 7.6x7.6 cm vegetation samples from bare soil at sensor heights of 30 and 41 cm from the ground. The Weed Warden is a proof-of-concept component of an alternative system to robotic weeders of fallow fields that could help reduce costs, improve environmental outcomes in agricultural settings, and advance research into fallow field management practices.(c) 2022 The Authors.

In this paper, collected by a motorized telescope mount was data analyzed using both video observations by trained observers and modernized approaches using computer vision. The more advanced data extraction used the OpenCV library of computer vision tools to identify bird silhouettes by means of image stabilization and background subtraction. The silhouettes were sanitized and analyzed in sequence to produce stacked relationships between temporally close contours, discriminating birds from noise based on the assumption that birds migrate in stable paths. The flight ceiling of the birds was determined by extracting relevant correlation coefficient data from doppler radar co-located with the LunAero instrument in Norman, OK, USA using a method with low-computational overhead. The bird paths and flight ceiling were combined with lunar ephemera to provide input for the original method used for nocturnal migration quantification as well as an enhanced version of the same method with more advanced computational tools. We found that the manual quantification of migration activity detected 16,300 birds/km center dot h heading northwest from 110 degrees, whereas the automated analysis reported a density of 43,794 birds/km center dot h heading northwest from 106.67 degrees. Hence, there was agreement with regard to flight direction, but the automated method overestimated migration density by approximately three times. The reasons for the discrepancy between flight path detection appeared to be due to a substantial amount of noise in the video data as well as a tendency for the computer vision analysis to split single flight paths into two or more segments.

To facilitate mass collaboration and accelerate progress, many groups have adopted open-source development models, inspired by the long history of open-source development in software. According to the Open-source Hardware Association (OSHWA), Open-source Hardware (OSH) is a term for tangible artifacts - machines, devices, or other physical things - whose design has been released to the public in such a way that anyone can make, modify, and use them. One major obstacle to translating the growing body of work on open-source ventilators into clinical practice is compliance with regulations and conformance with mandated technical standards for effective performance and device safety. This is exacerbated by the inherent complexity of the regulatory process, which is tailored to traditional centralized development models, as well as the rapid changes and alternative pathways that have emerged during the pandemic. As a step in addressing this challenge, this paper provides developers, evaluators, and potential users of emergency ventilators with the first iteration of a pragmatic, open-source assessment framework that incorporates existing regulatory guidelines from Australia, Canada, UK and USA. We also provide an example evaluation for one open-source emergency ventilator design. The evaluation process has been divided into three levels: 1. Adequacy of open-source project documentation; 2. Clinical performance requirements, and 3. Conformance with technical standards.(c) 2022 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

While modern cloud-based solutions to collaborative design are gaining popularity, they diminish the control of each design partner. In contrast, software designers readily collaborate on highly complex software, while retaining direct control of the files they are editing due to the dominance of distributed version control. Distributed version control for software is often coupled with 'Developer Operations' or DevOps tools to automate critical processes and facilitate communication. This paper explores how DevOps workflows can be adapted for open development of hardware. An example of how DevOps for hardware (HardOps) can be implemented is provided by the OpenFlexure Microscope project. While much ground remains to be broken in this field, HardOps can support a new paradigm of distributed hardware development, with enormous benefits not only for open-source hardware, but also commercial hardware.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,1959,,,

Researchers are increasingly concerned about exposure to glyphosate and the risks its poses to human health, since it may cause substantial damage, even in small doses. The detection of glyphosate residues in waters is not a simple task, as it requires complex and expensive equipment and qualified personnel. New technological tools need to be designed and developed, based on proven, but also cost-efficient, agile, and user-friendly, analytical techniques, which can be used in the field and in the lab, enabled by connectivity and multiplatform software applications. This article presents the design, development, and testing of an innovative low-cost visible and near-infrared (VIS-NIR) spectrometer (called SpectroGLY), based on Internet of Things (IoT) technologies, which allows potential glyphosate contamination in waters to be detected. SpectroGLY combines the functional concept of a traditional lab spectrometer with the IoT technological concept, enabling the integration of several connectivity options for rural and urban settings and digital visualization and monitoring platforms (Mobile App and Dashboard Web). Thanks to its portability, it can be used in any context and provides results in 10 min. Additionally, it is unnecessary to transfer the sample to a laboratory (optimizing time, costs, and the capacity for corrective actions by the authorities).

Fault rates increase in turn and become more concerning, particularly at the scale of High-Performance Computing (HPC) systems: on one hand, hardware fault protection is costly - more than 10% silicon area for floating-point units; on the other, HPC users expect correct application output after the anticipated time of computation, but workloads are seldom bit-reproducible and tolerances in output are allowed for. Benign hardware faults causing errors within these tolerances are therefore acceptable: however, with abstract reliability targets such as 'undetected failures per time,' current HPC system design does not allow for pursuing trade-offs between reliability and performance with respect to faults. To address the above, we propose a user-centric reliability benchmark to specify HPC system reliability targets, allowing for better performance optimizations in hardware design, while meeting HPC user expectations.

In most of these instruments, sample injection is effected manually with low to moderate precision and requires skilled operators. Although few automated samplers have been previously developed, typically only one sample at a time can be injected. If a series of samples is to be analyzed, manual intervention is required. In the present work, we developed and constructed a fully automated, open source, CE autosampler, able to handle up to 14 different samples that can be used as a modular component of any in-house built CE instrument. Results: An inexpensive, 3D printed, open source, autosampler for CE was developed. The autosampler consists of two parts: an injection unit with carousel containing sample and electrolyte vials and a flushing unit, containing a miniature pressure/vacuum pump. The autosampler is operated by an Arduino Mega microcontroller and an Arduino code written in the laboratory. The injection sequence is entered through a keypad and LCD display by the user. The instrument can operate autonomously for extended periods of time. It was used for fully automated analysis and/or calibration of up to 14 samples with excellent injection repeatability reaching less than 2.7% RSD for peak areas. The sampler performance was tested with two independently built CE instruments, a CE system with contactless conductivity detection (C4D) and a CE system with laser induced fluorescence (LIF) detector.Significance and novelty: A novel, 3D printed, Arduino-based autosampler for CE was developed. The autosampler allows autonomous hydrodynamic injection of up to 14 different samples with fully programmable injection sequence, including capillary flushing and high voltage and data acquisition control.

This paper proposes a distributed wireless sensor network system architecture based on open-source hardware and open-source software technologies to achieve that. The proposed architecture is designed for acquiring solar radiation data and other ambient parameters (solar panel and ambient temperature, light intensity, etc.). These data are collected primarily to define estimation techniques using nonlinear regression for predicting solar panel voltage outputs that can be used to achieve energy-efficient operations of solar-powered sensor nodes in outdoor Industrial IoT systems. Additionally, data can be used to analyze and monitor the influence of multiple ambient data on the efficiency of solar panels and, thus, powering sensor nodes. The architecture proposal considers the variety of required data and the transmission and storage of harvested data for further processing. The proposed architecture is implemented in the small-scale variants for evaluation and testing. The platform is further evaluated with the prototype sensor node for collecting solar panel voltage generation data with open-source hardware and low-cost components for designing such data acquisition nodes. The sensor node is evaluated in different scenarios with solar and artificial light conditions for the feasibility of the proposed architecture and justification of its usage. As a result of this research, the platform and the method for implementing estimation techniques for sensor nodes in various sensor and IoT networks, which helps to achieve edge intelligence, is established.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,1969,,,

To bypass this need for expensive industrial-grade equipment, this work presents a low-cost shot peen forming system that enables researchers to validate their methods experimentally on small samples. Conventional installations can cost a few 100,000 USD while the proposed prototype only costs 400 USD to produce. Such a prototype can operate on a tabletop with conventional electrical installations.

Current systems have a maximum length of about ten meters, and for a typical greenhouse application that length may not be sufficient. The price of the system increases with an increase in length, and with a base price in the thousands of dollars it becomes impractical to buy a system for such application. Our HyperRail is a modular linear motion system with a repeatability of 2 mm and current top speed of 200 mm/s. This is possible through a stepper motor driver that allows for 1/16th microstepping giving an average of 6180 steps per revolution. An advantage that this system has is its ability to increase or decrease the length of system with minimum effort and only nominal increase in price. The HyperRail can be mounted on a set of tripods or directly on the structure of a building such as a greenhouse.

However, multi-color or hyperspectral SMLM can pose particular challenges which affect image quality and data interpretation, such as unequal photophysical performance of fluorophores and non-linear image registration issues, which arise as two emission channels travel along different optical paths to reach the detector. In addition, using evanescent-wave based approaches (Total Internal Reflection Fluorescence: TIRF) where beam shape, decay depth, and power density are important, different illumination wavelengths can lead to unequal imaging depth across multiple channels on the same sample. A potential useful approach would be to use a single excitation wavelength to perform hyperspectral localization imaging. We report herein on the use of a variable angle tunable thin-film filter to spectrally isolate far-red emitting fluorophores. This solution was integrated into a commercial microscope platform using an open-source hardware design, enabling the rapid acquisition of SMLM images arising from fluorescence emission captured within similar to 15 nm to 20 nm spectral windows (or detection bands). By characterizing intensity distributions, average intensities, and localization frequency through a range of spectral windows, we investigated several far-red emitting fluorophores and identified an optimal fluorophore pair for two-color SMLM using this method. Fluorophore crosstalk between the different spectral windows was assessed by examining the effect of varying the photon output thresholds on the localization frequency and fraction of data recovered. The utility of this approach was demonstrated by hyper-spectral super-resolution imaging of the interaction between the mitochondrial protein, TOM20, and the peroxisomal protein, PMP70.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,1979,,,

This work presents the clinical validation of the G-STRIDE system, a 6-axis inertial measurement unit (IMU) with onboard processing algorithms, that allows the calculation of walking-related metrics correlated with clinical markers of fall risk. A cross-sectional case-control study was conducted with 163 participants (falls and non-falls groups). All volunteers were assessed with clinical scales and conducted a 15-min walking test at a self-selected pace while wearing the G-STRIDE. G-STRIDE is a low-cost solution to facilitate the transfer to society and clinical evaluations. It is open hardware and flexible and, thus, has the advantage of providing runtime data processing. Walking descriptors were derived from the device, and a correlation analysis was conducted between walking and clinical variables. G-STRIDE allowed measuring walking parameters in non-restricted walking conditions (e.g. hallway). Walking parameters statistically discriminate between falls and non-falls groups. We found good/excellent estimation accuracy (ICC = 0.885; p < 0.000 ) for walking speed, showing good/excellent correlation between gait speed and several clinical variables.

His aim is neither environmental protection nor the prevention of unforeseen side-effects of technology development, but the comprehensibility of technologies' operating principles for the user. For if the construction or repairing of tools requires expert knowledge inaccessible to the public, this necessarily entails social imbalances in power. In a similar manner, Bernard Stiegler conceives the delegation of know-how to technological systems as a kind of proletarianization that ultimately may result in a loss of savoir-vivre. Without sweepingly rejecting the division of labour, automation or specialized knowledge, practices of commoning respond to such diagnoses: free software like GNU/Linux or open hardware largely succeed in unlinking the expert knowledge that advanced computing doubtlessly requires from problematic power effects. From this perspective, proprietary algorithms are problematic, as their lack of transparency prevents conviviality. This also holds for the practices of data aggregation and extraction which steadily increase the information gap between platform providers and users. An even more fundamental problem is posed by so-called ""self-learning"", i.e., recursively adapting, algorithms: it is not clear how and to what extent the knowledge and instructions generated by ""artificial intelligence"" can be traced and reconstructed by human insight. Thus, we are confronted with a situation of potentially non-recoverable proletarianization and non-conviviality that exposes a renewed urgency of Illich's considerations concerning technological self-limitation.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,1983,,,

However, it is already known that shared memory is vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks since mechanisms to check integrity or authenticate callers for the shared memory payload are not supported in TrustZone. While an encryption-based method that resolves this limitation does exist, there are some architectural limitations. Indeed, even with key protection countermeasures applied, there is a risk that encryption keys may be leaked, as they are placed in insecure user memory during communication. Moreover, countermeasures for key leakage cause system performance overhead. In this paper, we propose a lightweight and secure scheme for shared memory, called Software One-Time Programmable Memory (SOTPM). SOTPM is a software-implemented, one-time programmable shared memory. It is based on the idea that payload encryption in the shared memory layer is unnecessary because sensitive data is already encrypted in the application layer before being written to the shared memory. SOTPM is set to read-only after data is written into SOTPM due to the one-time programmable characteristic. Therefore, attackers are unable to manipulate content in SOTPM during communication. Since it is not necessary for SOTPM to encrypt the payload in order to prevent malicious payload manipulation, it is possible to remove the risk of key leakage posed in previous studies. Additionally, in contrast with the existing method, our method can dramatically reduce system performance overhead. We implemented our prototype on an open-source hardware board with an Armv8-A processor and performed a security analysis and performance evaluation. The results show that SOTPM provides a sufficient level of security and less than 1% performance overhead, implying that SOTPM is a reasonable solution for current commercial products.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,1991,,,

Given that advent of Internet of Things (IoT) era due to mobile technology progressions, the future needs a sorting method that is available on any environment, such as not only high performance systems like servers but also low computational performance machines like embedded systems. In this paper, we present an FPGA-based sorting accelerator combining Sorting Network and Merge Sorter Tree, which is customizable by means of tuning design parameters. The proposed FPGA accelerator sorts data sent from a host PC via the PCIe bus, and sends back the fully sorted data sequence to it. We also present a detailed analytical model that accurately estimates the sorting performance. Due to these characteristics, designers can know how fast a developed sorting hardware is in advance and can implement the best one to fulfill the cost and performance constraints. Our experiments show that the proposed hardware achieves up to 19.5x sorting performance, compared with Intel Core i7-3770K operating at 3.50GHz, when sorting 256M 32-bits integer elements. However, this result is limited because of insufficient memory bandwidth. To overcome this problem, we propose a data compression mechanism and the experimental result shows that the sorting hardware with it achieves almost 90% of the estimated performance, while the hardware without it does about 60%.

To meet this research need a low-cost 3-D printable open source dual axis gimbal system is presented in this study. An Arduino based microcontroller is used to move the sample holder to the user specified angle where two stepper motors control the motion providing two degrees of freedom. The sample holder is made in such a way that samples can easily be mounted on it by two movable latches. The system was validated and characterized for: i) unidirectional accuracy, ii) repeatability, iii) backlash, iv) speed resolution and v) microstep size. Finally, the mechatronic system is tested for the intended application using a halogen light source and a spectrometer to measure transmission through glass TCO samples through a hemisphere.

One popular approach is to measure the movements of restrained animals while presenting controlled sensory stimulation. This approach is especially powerful when applied to genetic model organisms, such as Drosophila melanogaster, where modern genetic tools enable unprecedented access to the nervous system for activity monitoring or targeted manipulation. While there is a long history of measuring the behavior of body- and head-fixed insects walking on an air-supported ball, the methods typically require complex setups with many custom components. Here we present a compact, simplified setup for these experiments that achieves high-performance at low cost. The simplified setup integrates existing hardware and software solutions with new component designs. We replaced expensive optomechanical and custom machined components with off-the-shelf and 3D-printed parts, and built the system around a low-cost camera that achieves 180 Hz imaging and an inexpensive tablet computer to present view-angle-corrected stimuli updated through a local network. We quantify the performance of the integrated system and characterize the visually guided behavior of flies in response to a range of visual stimuli. In this paper, we thoroughly document the improved system; the accompanying repository incorporates CAD files, parts lists, source code, and detailed instructions. We detail a complete ~$300 system, including a cold-anesthesia tethering stage, that is ideal for hands-on teaching laboratories. This represents a nearly 50-fold cost reduction as compared to a typical system used in research laboratories, yet is fully featured and yields excellent performance. We report the current state of this system, which started with a 1-day teaching lab for which we built seven parallel setups and continues toward a setup in our lab for larger-scale analysis of visual-motor behavior in flies. Because of the simplicity, compactness, and low cost of this system, we believe that high-performance measurements of tethered insect behavior should now be widely accessible and suitable for integration into many systems.

Currently, as no commercial continuum robot platform is available, a large variety of early-stage prototypes exists. These prototypes are developed by individual research groups and are often used for a single publication. Thus, a significant amount of time is devoted to creating proprietary hardware and software hindering the development of a common platform, and shifting away scarce time and efforts from the main research challenges. We address this problem by proposing an open-source actuation module, which can be used to build different types of continuum robots. It consists of a high-torque brushless electric motor, a high resolution optical encoder, and a low-gear-ratio transmission. For this article, we create three different types of continuum robots. In addition, we illustrate, for the first time, that continuum robots built with our actuation module can proprioceptively detect external forces. Consequently, our approach opens untapped and under-investigated research directions related to the dynamics and advanced control of continuum robots, where sensing the generalized flow and effort is mandatory. Besides that, we democratize continuum robots research by providing open-source software and hardware with our initiative called the Open Continuum Robotics Project, to increase the accessibility and reproducibility of advanced methods.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,2020,,,

The combination of accessible hardware and high-performance deep learning (DL) tools for plant analysis is becoming widely recognised as a path forward for both plant science and applied precision agricultural purposes. Yet, a lack of collaboration in image analysis for plant science, despite the open-source origins of much of the technology, is hindering development. Here, we show how tools developed for specific attributes of phenotyping or weed recognition for precision weed control have substantial overlapping data structure, software/hardware requirements and outputs. An open-source approach to these tools facilitates interdisciplinary collaboration, avoiding unnecessary repetition and allowing research groups in both basic and applied sciences to capitalise on advancements and resolve respective bottlenecks. The approach mimics that of machine learning in its nascence. Three areas of collaboration are identified as critical for improving efficiency, (1) standardized, open-source, annotated dataset development with consistent metadata reporting; (2) establishment of accessible and reliable training and testing platforms for DL algorithms; and (3) sharing of all source code used in the research process. The complexity of imaging plants and cost of annotating image datasets means that collaboration from typically distinct fields will be necessary to capitalize on the benefits of DL for both applied and basic science purposes.",https://academic.oup.com/aobpla/advance-article-pdf/doi/10.1093/aobpla/plad010/49467881/plad010.pdf,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,2023,,,

IoT devices are currently being used in many fields. IoT devices use Wi-Fi and Bluetooth, however, communication distance is short and battery consumption is high. In areas such as smart cities and smart farms, IoT technology is needed to support a wide coverage with low power consumption. Low Power Wide Area (LPWA), which is a transmission used in IoT supporting a wide area with low power consumption, has evolved. LPWA includes Long Range (LoRa), Narrowband (NB-IoT), and Sigfox. LoRa offers many benefits as it communicates the longest distances, is cheap and consumes less battery. LoRa is used in many countries and covers a range of hundreds of square kilometers (km(2)) with a single gateway. However, if there are many obstacles to smart cities and smart farms, it causes communication problems. This paper proposes two (2) solutions to this problem: the relay method which is a multi-hop method and the Automatic Repeat Request (ARQ) system that detects packet loss in real-time and requests retransmission for LoRa. In this study, the actual performance of LoRa in the problematic environment was measured and the proposed method was applied. It was confirmed that the transmission rate of LoRa dropped when there were many obstacles such as trees. To use LoRa in a smart farm with a lot of space, multi-hop was observed to be better. An ARQ system is needed to compensate for the unexpected drop in the forward rate due to the increase in IoT devices. This research focused on reliability, however, additional network methods and automatic repeat request (ARQ) systems considering battery time should be researched in symmetry. This study covers the interdisciplinary field of computer science and wireless low power communication engineering. We have analyzed the LoRa/LoRaWAN technology in an experimental approach, which has been somewhat less studied than cellular network or WiFi technology. In addition, we presented and improved the performance evaluation results in consideration of various local and climatic environments.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,2042,,,

Sensor-management systems typically perform three fundamental tasks: sample sensors at a specified time or period, save data onto retrievable media, and switch power to components on and off in between sample cycles to conserve battery energy and increase field operation time. These tasks are commonly accomplished through integrating separate off-the-shelf components into the desired system such as: power relays, SD card hardware, Real-Time Clocks (RTCs), and coin cell batteries. To enable faster prototyping, the Openly Published Environmental Sensing Lab abstracted all of these requirements into a single printed circuit board (PCB), Hypnos, that can be included in any project to achieve these commonly-required capabilities: powering on and off connected sensors on a schedule and logging collected data to the removable SD card. The hardware is laid out in a ""Feather"" form factor, a popular configuration in the open-source hardware community, to easily mate with other industry standard products. The onboard RTC acts as an alarm clock that wakes a user-attached microprocessor from low-power sleep modes in between sample cycles. By integrating all these components into a single PCB, we save cost while significantly reducing physical system size. The design as well as a suite of code functions that enable the user to configure all the Hypnos board features are detailed. (C) 2021 The Authors.

Likewise, the system can detect autonomously water quality parameters outside configurable thresholds and deliver management alarms.

This article describes the invention of a new testing system: the parametric open source cold-frame agrivoltaic system (POSCAS). POSCAS is an adapted gardening cold-frame used in cold climates as it acts as a small greenhouse for agricultural production. POSCAS is designed to test partially transparent solar photovoltaic (PV) modules targeting the agrivoltaic market. It can both function as a traditional cold frame, but it can also be automated to function as a full-service greenhouse. The integrated PV module roof can be used to power the controls or it can be attached to a microinverter to produce power. POSCAS can be placed in an experimental array for testing agricultural and power production. It can be easily adapted for any type of partially transparent PV module. An array of POSCAS systems allows for the testing of agrivoltaic impacts from the percent transparency of the modules by varying the thickness of a thin film PV material or the density of silicon-based cells, and various forms of optical enhancement, anti-reflection coatings and solar light spectral shifting materials in the back sheet.

Yet, global plastics production has quadrupled in 40 years and only 9 % has been recycled. If these trends continue, carbon emis-sions from plastic wastes would reach 15 % of global carbon budgets by 2050. An approach to reducing plastic waste is to use distributed recycling for additive manufacturing (DRAM) where virgin plastic products are replaced by locally manufactured recycled plastic products that have no transportation-related carbon emissions. Unfortunately, the design of most 3-D printers forces an increase in the machine cost to expand for recycling plastic at scale. Recently, a fused granular fabrication (FGF)/fused particle fabrication (FPF) large-scale prin-ter was demonstrated with a GigabotX extruder based on the open source cable driven Hangprinter concept. To further improve that system, here a lower-cost recyclebot direct waste plastic extruder is demonstrated and the full designs, assembly and operation are detailed. The <$1,700 machine's accuracy and printing performance are quantified, and the printed parts mechanical strength is within the range of other systems. Along with sup-port from the Hangprinter and DUET3 communities, open hardware developers have a rich ecosystem to modify in order to print directly from waste plastic for DRAM.(c) 2023 The Author(s).

A better understanding of the mechanical properties of 3-D printing thermoplastics at cryogenic temperatures is essential to material selection, part design, and printing optimization. The goal of the present study was to explore the feasibility of development for a 3-D printed device ('CryoTensileDevice') to hold a test specimen in liquid nitrogen and be mounted in standard mechanical testing systems to evaluate 3-D printing material behaviors at cryogenic temperatures. The CryoTensileDevice was prototyped with flexible filaments with a per-unit material cost of <US$5 and a printing time of 5 h. The commonly used printing filament polylactic acid (PLA) was selected to evaluate the utility of the CryoTensileDevice. At room temperature, the CryoTensileDevice did not significantly (P 0.05) affect PLA tensile measurements such as Young's modulus, yield stress, yield strain, stress at break, or strain at break. With the CryoTensileDevice, specimens 3-D printed with PLA at 50%, 75%, and 100% infill rates had comparable tensile properties when tested at room and liquid nitrogen temperatures. The PLA showed superior performance in tensile properties in comparison to acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS).

Based on the model and the BLE specification for spur emission, a requirement for the PLL fractional spurs is derived. To meet the derived spectral mask by reducing the fractional spurs, a novel synthesizable two-step time to digital converter (TSTDC) that employs embedded TDC (EMBTDC) as coarse and Vernier delay-line TDC (DLTDC) as fine TDC is proposed. We also present a digital calibration scheme to compensate for the nonlinearity induced by the place-and-route (P&R) tool. The PLL is fabricated in 12-nm FinFET and demonstrated in a BLE-TX. The measured BLE transmissions satisfy the standard requirements thanks to the reduced fractional spurs. In a standalone PLL mode, the proposed TSTDC and calibration scheme reduced the fractional spurs by 14.3 dB compared to only using an EMBTDC in near integer N operation. The PLL supports a frequency range of 1.8-2.7 GHz and consumes 3.91 mW at 2.4006 GHz achieving figure of merit (FoM) of -220.7 dB in fractional-N mode with a 40 MHz reference, occupying an area of 0.063 mm(2).

This application requires dedicated transmit/receive (Tx/Rx) switches that support high peak powers for MRI and high average powers for RF heating. To meet this goal, we propose a high-performance Tx/Rx switch based on positive-intrinsic-negative diodes and quarter-wavelength (lambda/4) stubs. Methods: The lambda/4 stubs in the proposed Tx/Rx switch design route the transmitted RF signal directly to the RF coil/antenna without passing through any electronic components (e.g., positive-intrinsic-negative diodes). Bench measurements, MRI, MR thermometry, and RF heating experiments were performed at f = 297 MHz (B-0 = 7 T) to examine the characteristics and applicability of the switch. Results: The proposed design provided an isolation of -235.7dB/-241.5dB during transmission/reception. The insertion loss was -20.41dB/-20.27dB during transmission/reception. The switch supports high peak (3.9 kW) and high average (120 W) RF powers for MRI and RF heating at f = 297 MHz. High-resolution MRI of the wrist yielded image quality competitive with that obtained with a conventional Tx/Rx switch. Radiofrequency heating in phantom monitored by MR thermometry demonstrated the switch applicability for thermal modulation. Upon these findings, thermally activated release of a model drug attached to thermoresponsive polymers was demonstrated. Conclusion: The high-power Tx/Rx switch enables thermal MR applications at 7 T, contributing to the study of the role of temperature in biological systems and diseases.

Recently, the appearance of RISC-V open-source ISA creates new possibilities to develop customized computing platforms with high savings in the non-recurring engineering costs. Moreover, the current trends toward open-source hardware frameworks are aimed to reduce design time and cost for complex system-on-chip architectures. Therefore, modularity and re-usability of hardware components are major challenges for flexible hardware architectures. The motivation behind this work is to introduce a modular cluster-based many-core architecture for FPGA accelerators that is re-usable and flexible tailored to implement different many-core taxonomies with less design time and costs by using regular and replicated sets of computing, memory, and interconnection blocks. The proposed many-core architecture is built using multiple processing clusters coupled with a NoC for communication which allows a high degree of design scalability. The processing cluster inside features a configurable multi-core architecture consisting of multiple RISC-V processing elements (PE) tightly coupled with a bus-based interconnection for intra-cluster communication using parameterized scratchpad shared memory. Each PE features a single RISC-V core with a tightly coupled parameterized scratchpad local memory and generic AXI interface. Evaluation results demonstrate that the proposed architecture features a scalable computing performance of 501 MOp/s for 4 clusters and 878 MOp/s for 8 clusters. Moreover, a scalable memory bandwidth up to 4.3 GB/s is achieved for 9 clusters with a power consumption of 1.4 W per cluster utilizing 7.7% of on-chip memory resources. The many-core architecture is implemented and evaluated on Xilinx Virtex Ultrascale+ with the feature of changing the architecture configurations during run-time using dynamic and partial reconfiguration which provides more flexibility and re-usability.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,2088,,,

However, most vitrification tools adopted in aquatic research were initially designed for applications other than sperm (such as human embryo freezing) and, thus, pose challenges for adoption to sperm vitrification. Three-dimensional (3D) printing combined with open hardware sharing is an emerging strategy to address challenges in the development of cryopreservation tools. The goal of this study was to develop a 3D printed Vitrification Device for Cryo-Vials (VDCV) that can be integrated with the existing vial storage systems. The VDCV combined the vitrification and handling components to achieve functions of sample handling, vitrification, storage, and identification. The vitrification component featured a base, a stem, and a loop. A total of 36 configurations with various loop lengths (8, 10, and 12 mm); loop widths (2.0, 2.5, 3.0, and 3.5 mm); and support structures (open, transverse, and axial) of the VDCD prototypes were designed, fabricated, and tested. Device handling orientations (horizontal and vertical holding angles prior to and during freezing) were also investigated. Computer simulations estimated that the cooling rate of the samples ranged from 0.6-1.5 x 10(5) degrees C/min in all the configurations. Prior to freezing, loops with axial supports produced a minimum of 92% film retention. The overall trends of full vitrification occurrence were observed: horizontal plunging > vertical plunging, and axial support > transverse support and open loop. A loop length of 8 mm had the highest overall vitrification occurrence (86-100%). No significant differences (p = 0.6584) were shown in a volume capacity (5.7-6.0 mu L) among the three supporting configurations. A single unit of VDCV can provide loading efficiencies of about 6 x 10(7) sperm/vial, pooling of samples from 3-6 males/vial, and fertilization for 1800 eggs/vial. The VDCV are low-cost (<$0.5 material cost per unit) and can be customized, standardized, securely labeled, and efficiently stored. The prototypes can be accessed by user communities through open-fabrication file sharing and fabricated with consumer-level 3D printers, thus facilitating community-level standardization.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,2089,,,

Self-made devices have substantial variability , resulting in few opportunities for standardization across communities. The development of open hardware with the increasing accessibility of three-dimensional (3-D) printing offers rapid prototyping and easy fabrication of devices by users around the world at low cost. The present study explored the feasibility of developing operational prototypes of 3-D printed motorized cryopreservation devices for continuous freezing of non-batched samples. A controlled cooling conveyor device (CCCD) was designed and fabricated to cryopreserve sperm samples in straws that were loaded onto chain links suspended over liquid nitrogen held in a Styrofoam box. Cooling rates of 5-34 degrees C/min for 0.5-mL French straws were produced by adjusting the height of conveyor chains, slopes, and liquid nitrogen mass. The plunge temperature (-47 degrees C to -61 degrees C) was controlled by adjustment of conveyor speed. The cooling curves from the CCCD were comparable to a commercial programmable freezer. There were no significant differences in post-thaw motility of sperm from ornamental (Koi) common carp (Cyprinus carpio) among samples frozen with the CCCD and those frozen with a commercial programmable freezer. The post-thaw sperm motility was consistent among samples frozen in the CCCD across a 15-min time span.

In this paper we analyze the performances of open source firmware OpenWrt 21.x compared with a server-side operating system (Debian 11 x64) and Mikrotik 7.x, also virtualized, and different types of clients (Windows 10/11, iOS 15, Android 11, OpenWrt 21.x, Debian 11 x64 and Mikrotik 7.x), observing the performance of the network according to the current implementation of the various protocols and algorithms of VPN tunnel examined on what are the most recent HW and SW for deployment in outdoor locations with poor network connectivity. Specifically, operating systems provide different performance metric values for various combinations of configuration variables. The first pursued goal is to find the algorithms to guarantee a data transmission/encryption ratio as efficiently as possible. The second goal is to research the algorithms capable of guaranteeing the widest spectrum of compatibility with the current infrastructures that support VPN technology, to obtain a connection system secure for geographically scattered IoT networks spread over difficult-to-manage areas such as suburban or rural environments. The third goal is to be able to use open firmware on constrained routers that provide compatibility with different VPN protocols.",https://www.mdpi.com/1999-5903/14/9/264/pdf,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,2094,,,

The popular-priced and portable open source hardware is used as a bridge between CACSD tools and real plants to deliver the control and sensor data at the sampling time points. Ten I/O function blocks written in C code are developed based on the CACSD tool employed for the proposed light-weight RCP system in order to handle I/O operation in a simple way. In addition, we suggest two practical strategies, a batch transfer strategy and a variable sampling period method, to increase the sampling rate of the control system. It is shown through experiment that the proposed light-weight RCP system works well up to a sampling rate of 2 kHz without adopting expensive hardware and C code generators. It is expected that the proposed RCP system will be considered as affordable and readily available to schools for mass education.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,2095,,,

In this paper, a low-cost, computer-aided, and geophone-based system designed to record, monitor, and analyze three-component microtremor data is presented. This proposed system is not a simple data acquisition system. It is also an integrated system developed to interpret the microtremor data using the horizontal-to-vertical spectral ratio (H/V) method without any external software. Therefore, the H/V peak frequency and amplitude can be easily estimated using this system. The proposed system has several features such as a 200 Hz sampling frequency, approximately 72 dB dynamic range, text data format, and data analysis tools. This system consists of a graphical user interface developed by using the .NET Framework 4.5.2 and external hardware that includes signal conditioning circuits, voltage converter circuit, external analog-to-digital converter, and Arduino Uno board. The proposed system uses low-cost vertical and horizontal geophones with a 4.5 Hz natural frequency to measure three-component microtremor data. The developed software undertakes many tasks such as communication between the external hardware and computer, transferring, monitoring, and recording the seismic data to the computer, and interpretation of the recorded data using the Nakamura method. Channel consistency and internal noise measurement tests were performed to demonstrate the accuracy and precision of the proposed system. The proposed system was compared to a commercial triaxial digital seismograph, and satisfactory results were obtained. The developed system is a completely open-source and open-hardware system and can be easily used in academic studies conducted by researchers and university students who are interested in seismic ambient noise analysis.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,2096,,,

Accurate synchronization between the instrument computer, beam scanning system and excitation source is required to collect high quality data and minimize sample damage in SAIM acquisitions.

We show how the integration of waveform generation, multiplexed analog outputs, and native hardware triggers into a single central hub provides a versatile platform for performing fast circle-scanning acquisitions, including azimuthal scanning SAIM and multiangle TIRF.

Therefore, and considering that COVID-19 generally causes damage to the respiratory system (in the form of lung infection), it is essential to ensure the best pulmonary ventilation for the patient. However, depending on the severity of the disease and the health condition of the patient, the situation can become critical when the patient has respiratory distress or becomes unable to breathe on his/her own. In that case, the ventilator becomes the lifeline of the patient. This device must keep patients stable until, on their own or with the help of medications, they manage to overcome the lung infection. However, with thousands or hundreds of thousands of infected patients, no country has enough ventilators. If this situation has become critical in the Global North, it has turned disastrous in developing countries, where ventilators are even more scarce.

Lack of reliable quality management tools has impeded repository development in the past several decades. Microfabricated open-hardware devices have emerged as a new approach to assist repository development by providing standardized quality assessment capabilities to enable routine quality control. However, prototyping of microfabricated devices (microdevices) traditionally relies on photolithography techniques that are costly, time intensive, and accessible only through specialized engineering laboratories. Although resin 3-D printing has been introduced into the microfabrication domain, existing publications focus on customized or high-cost (>thousands of USD) printers. The goal of this report was to identify and call attention to the emerging opportunities to support innovation in microfabrication by use of low-cost (<USD 350) resin 3-D printing for rapid prototyping. We demonstrate that low-cost mask-based stereolithography (MSLA) 3-D printers with straightforward modifications can provide fabrication quality that approaches traditional photolithography techniques. For example, reliable feature sizes of 20 <mu>m with dimensional discrepancy of <4% for lateral dimensions and <5% for vertical dimensions were fabricated with a consumer-level MSLA printers. In addition, alterations made to pre-processing, post-processing, and printer configuration steps improved print quality as demonstrated in objects with sharper edges and smoother surfaces. The prototyping time and cost of resin 3-D printing (3 h with USD 0.5/prototype) were considerably lower than those of traditional photolithography (5 d with USD 80/prototype). With the rapid advance of consumer-grade printers, resin 3-D printing can revolutionize rapid prototyping approaches for microdevices in the near future, facilitating participation in interdisciplinary development of innovative hardware to support germplasm repository development for aquatic species.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,2116,,,

For this purpose, we have developed the AICARP (Ambient Intelligence Context-aware Affective Recommender Platform) infrastructure, which detects changes in the emotional state of the user and provides personalized multisensorial support to help manage the emotional state by taking advantage of ambient intelligence features. We have developed a third version of this infrastructure, AICARP.V3, which addresses several problems detected in the data acquisition stage of the second version, (i.e., intrusion of the pulse sensor, poor resolution and lowsignal to noise ratio in the galvanic skin response sensor and slow response time of the temperature sensor) and extends the capabilities to integrate new actuators. This improved incorporates a new acquisition platform(shield) called PhyAS (Physiological Acquisition Shield), which reduces the number of control units to only one, and supports both gathering physiological signalswith better precision and delivering multisensory feedback with more flexibility, by means of new actuators that can be added/discarded on top of just that single shield. The improvements in the quality of the acquired signals allow better recognition of the emotional states. Thereof, AICARP.V3 gives a more accurate personalized emotional support to the user, based on a rule-based approach that triggers multisensorial feedback, if necessary.

Developments of modular and scalable electrophysiological data acquisition systems for experimental research enhance understanding and progress in the field. To contribute to such an endeavor, we present an open-source hardware project called High-Channel Count Electrophysiology or HiCCE, targeting to produce an easily-adaptable, cost-effective, and affordable electrophysiological acquisition system as an alternative solution for mostly available commercial tools and the current state of the art in the field.

Therefore, battery manufacturers tend to reduce the battery cost by using simple battery management systems that provide only basic safety features. Possible advanced functionalities are not implemented and the battery may lose performanceduring its use. Widely spread maintenance centers are thus required to support the mobility electrification process, but their diffusion is limited by the high cost ofprofessional battery characterization instruments. This work proposes an open-hardware low-cost battery maintenance tool architecture that can be used with common laboratory instruments. The tool is based on a relay-matrix and a battery monitor integrated circuit. It is able to completely characterize and optimize the state of a battery independently of the battery management system and also gives a figure of the individual aging of the battery cells.

MRI magnets can be constructed based on permanent neodymium-iron-boron (NdFeB) magnets in discretized arrangements, leading to substantially lower mass and costs. A challenge with these designs is, however, a good B-0 field homogeneity, which is needed to produce high quality images free of distortions. In this work, we describe an iterative approach to build a low-field MR magnet based on a B-0-shimming methodology using genetic algorithms. The methodology is tested by constructing a small bore (inner bore diameter = 130 mm) desktop MR magnet (<15 kg) at a field strength of B-0 = 0.1 T and a target volume of 4 cm in diameter. The configuration consists of a base magnet and shim inserts, which can be placed iteratively without modifying the base magnet assembly and without changing the inner dimensions of the bore or the outer dimensions of the MR magnet. Applying the shims, B0 field inhomogeneity could be reduced by a factor 8 from 5,448 to 682 ppm in the target central slice of the magnet. Further improvements of these results can be achieved in a second or third iteration, using more sensitive magnetic field probes (e.g., nuclear magnetic resonance based magnetic field measurements). The presented methodology is scalable to bigger magnet designs. The MR magnet can be reproduced with off-the-shelf components and a 3D printer and no special tools are needed for construction.

It was shown that electrically stimulating the brain can be used to produce simple visual impressions of light blobs (phosphenes). This technology, using electrodes placed on top of the visual cortex, was successfully used to give blind people some degree of visual impression of their surrounding. However, this perception is very far away from natural sight. For developing the next generation of visual prostheses, real-time closed-loop stimulators are required. Such a stimulator measures the actual neuronal activities and on this basis determines the required stimulation pattern. In addition, there is a desire to shrink the diameter of the applied electrodes and increase their spatial density. This leads to the challenge of designing a system that can produce arbitrary stimulation-patterns with up to +/- 70 V and with up to 25 mA while measuring neuronal signals with amplitudes in the order of mV. Furthermore, interruptions of the measurements during stimulation should be as short as possible and the system needs to scale to hundreds of electrodes. We discuss how such a system and especially its current pumps and input protection need to be designed and which problems arise. We condense our findings into an example design for which we provide all design files (boards, firmwares and software) as open-source. This is a first step in taking the existing open-sourcewww.open-ephys.org recording system and converting it into a closed-loop experimental setup for neuro-prosthetic research. (C) 2019 The Authors.

An effective, reusable, locally-manufactured respirator can mitigate this problem. We describe the development, manufacture, and preliminary testing of an open-hardware-licensed device, the ""simple silicone mask"" (SSM). Methods A multidisciplinary team developed a reusable silicone half facepiece respirator over 9 prototype iterations. The manufacturing process consisted of 3D printing and silicone casting. Prototypes were assessed for comfort and breathability. Filtration was assessed by user seal checks and quantitative fit-testing according to CSA Z94.4-18. Results The respirator originally included a cartridge for holding filter material; this was modified to connect to standard heat-moisture exchange (HME) filters (N95 or greater) after the cartridge showed poor filtration performance due to flow acceleration around the filter edges, which was exacerbated by high filter resistance. All 8 HME-based iterations provided an adequate seal by user seal checks and achieved a pass rate of 87.5% (N = 8) on quantitative testing, with all failures occurring in the first iteration. The overall median fit-factor was 1662 (100 = pass). Estimated unit cost for a production run of 1000 using distributed manufacturing techniques is CAD $15 in materials and 20 minutes of labor. Conclusion Small-scale manufacturing of an effective, reusable N95 respirator during a pandemic is feasible and cost-effective. Required quantities of reusables are more predictable and less vulnerable to supply chain disruption than disposables. With further evaluation, such devices may be an alternative to disposable respirators during public health emergencies. The respirator described above is an investigational device and requires further evaluation and regulatory requirements before clinical deployment.

To address this, we developed an open-source-based 3D printer with increased environment controls. These include an enclosure and part heating using infrared energy focused on the printed part to keep it close to the desired temperature, while the printer components stay within their design operating ranges. This enables printing of high-temperature polymers while preventing damage to the machine. The effectiveness of this approach is demonstrated by printing polyetherimide parts (T-g = 217 degrees C). The temperature of the part as well as temperatures at various locations in the build chamber is monitored and assessed.

An automated high-throughput protocol was developed demonstrating the synthesis of CdSe nanocrystals using sonochemistry and different combinations of sample conditions, including precursor and ligand compositions and concentrations. Cavitation caused by ultrasound fields causes local and transient increases in temperature and pressure sufficient to drive the decomposition of organometallic precursors to drive the chemical reaction leading to nanocrystal formation. A total of 625 unique sample conditions were prepared and analyzed in triplicate with an individual sample volume of as little as 0.5 mL, which drastically reduced chemical waste and experimental times. The rapid onset of cavitation and quick dissipation of energy result in fast nucleation with little nanocrystal growth leading to the formation of small nanocrystals or magic-size clusters (MSCs) depending on composition. Using the effective mass approximation, the calculated QD diameters obtained under all our experimental conditions ranged between 1.3 and 2.1 nm, which was also validated with small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS). Polydispersity, QD shape and optical properties largely varied depending on the concentration of ligands present in solution. Statistical analysis of the spectroscopic data corroborates the qualitative relationships observed from the optical characterization of the samples with the model-agnostic SHAP analysis. The complete workflow relies on relatively low-cost and open-source systems. Automation and the reduced volumes also allow for cost-efficient experimentation, increasing the accessibility of this MAP. The high-throughput capabilities of the automated sonication platform, the extensible nature of the Jubilee system, and the modular nature of the protocol, make the workflow adaptable to a variety of future studies, including other nanocrystal design spaces, emulsification processes, and nanoparticle re-dispersion or exfoliation.

Due to the severity of these attacks, manufacturers deploy hardware-based fault defenses into security-critical systems, such as secure elements. The development of these countermeasures is a challenging task due to the complex interplay of circuit components and because contemporary design automation tools tend to optimize inserted structures away, thereby defeating their purpose. Hence, it is critical that such countermeasures are rigorously verified post-synthesis. Since classical functional verification techniques fall short of assessing the effectiveness of countermeasures (due to the circuit being analyzed when no faults are present), developers have to resort to methods capable of injecting faults in a simulation testbench or into a physical chip sample. However, developing test sequences to inject faults in simulation is an error-prone task and performing fault attacks on a chip requires specialized equipment and is incredibly time-consuming. Moreover, identifying the fault-vulnerable circuit is hard in both approaches, and fixing potential design flaws post-silicon is usually infeasible since that would require another tape-out. To that end, this paper introduces SYNFI, a formal pre-silicon fault verification framework that operates on synthesized netlists. SYNFI can be used to analyze the general effect of faults on the input-output relationship in a circuit and its fault countermeasures, and thus enables hardware designers to assess and verify the effectiveness of embedded countermeasures in a systematic and semi-automatic way. The framework automatically extracts sensitive parts of the circuit, induces faults into the extracted subcircuit, and analyzes the faults‚Äô effects using formal methods. To demonstrate that SYNFI is capable of handling unmodified, industry-grade netlists synthesized with commercial and open tools, we analyze OpenTitan, the first opensource secure element. In our analysis, we identified critical security weaknesses in the unprotected AES block, developed targeted countermeasures, reassessed their security, and contributed these countermeasures back to the OpenTitan project. For other fault-hardened IP, such as the life cycle controller, we used SYNFI to confirm that existing countermeasures provide adequate protection.",https://tches.iacr.org/index.php/TCHES/article/download/9813/9318,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,2147,,,

Consumer 3D printing enabled rapid iterative prototyping to allow for a variety of instrumentation and assay setups and procedures. Three MVO versions have been produced. MVOv1.1 successfully performed part of a clinical assay, and results were comparable to those of commercial automation. Raspberry Pi 3 Model B (RPI3) single-board computers with Sense Hardware Attached on Top (HAT) and Raspberry Pi Camera Module V2 hardware were remotely accessed and evaluated for their suitability to qualify the latest MVOv1.2 platform. Sense HAT temperature, barometric pressure, and relative humidity sensors were stable in climate-controlled environments and are useful in identifying appropriate laboratory spaces for automation placement.

The challenge is to consider all of the different structures and components available and build the optimal power management on a microscale. The purpose of this paper is to streamline the design process by creating a novel reconfigurable testbed called Medlay. First, we propose a uniform interface for management functions e.g., power conversion, energy storing and power routing. This interface results in a clear layout because power and status pins are strictly separated, and inputs and outputs have fixed positions. Medlay is the ready-to-use and open-hardware platform based on the interface. It consists of a base board and small modules incorporating e.g., dc-dc converters, power switches and supercapacitors. Measurements confirm that Medlay represents a system on one circuit board, as parasitic effects of the interconnections are negligible. The versatility regarding different setups on the testbed is determined to over 250,000 combinations by layout graph grammar. Lastly, we underline the applicability by recreating three state-of-the-art systems with the testbed. In conclusion, Medlay facilitates building and testing power management in a very compact, clear and extensible fashion.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,2159,,,

This article presents a system for real-time industrial inspection of CSP plants using low-cost, open-source components in conjunction with a thermographic sensor and an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). The system, available in open-source hardware and software, is designed to be employed independently of the type of device used for inspection (laptop, smartphone, tablet or smartglasses) and its operating system. Several UAV flight missions were programmed as follows: flight altitudes at 20, 40, 60, 80, 100 and 120 m above ground level; and three cruising speeds: 5, 7 and 10 m/s. These settings were chosen and analyzed in order to optimize inspection time. The results indicate that it is possible to perform inspections by an UAV in real time at CSP plants as a means of detecting anomalous absorber tubes and improving the effectiveness of methodologies currently being utilized.

The complex inner geometry of conventional slot dies require expensive machining that limits accessibility and experimentation. In order to overcome these issues this study follows an open hardware approach, which uses an open source 3-D printer to both fabricate the slot die and then to functionalize a 3-D slot die printing system. Polymer materials are tested and selected for compatibility with common solvents and used to fabricate a custom slot die head. This slot die is then integrated into a 3-D printer augmented with a syringe pump to form an additive manufacturing platform for thin film semiconductor devices. The full design of the slot die system is disclosed here using an open source license including software and operational protocols. This study demonstrates that functional lab-grade slot dies may be 3-D printed using low-cost open source hardware methods A case study using NiO2 found an RMS value 0.486 nm, thickness of 17-49 nm, and a maximum optical transmission of 99.1%, which shows this additive manufacturing approach to slot die depositions as well of fabrication is capable of producing viable layers of advanced electronic materials. Using this method, a cost savings of over 17,000% was obtained when compared to commercial slot die systems for laboratories. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Most of the high-end open-source IoT platforms include built-in peripherals, such as the universal asynchronous receiver and transmitter (UART), pulse width modulation (PWM), general purpose input output (GPIO) ports and timers, and have enough computation power to run embedded operating systems such as Linux. However, each IoT platform has its own way of configuring peripherals, and it is difficult for programmers or users to configure the same peripheral on a different platform. Although diverse open-source IoT platforms are widespread, the difficulty in programming those platforms hinders the growth of IoT applications. Therefore, we propose an easy and convenient way to program and configure the operation of each peripheral using a user-friendly Web-based software framework. Through the implementation of the software framework and the real mobile robot application development along with it, we show the feasibility of the proposed software framework, named SoEasy.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,2176,,,

ROACH is an open-source hardware and software platform featuring a large Xilinx Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA), Power PC processor, several 10 GB Ethernet SFP+ interfaces, and a collection of daughter boards for analog signal generation and acquisition. The combination of a ROACH board, ADC/DAC conversion daughter boards, and hardware for RF mixing allows for the generation and capture of multiple RF tones for reading out microwave multiplexed X-ray TES microcalorimeters. The FPGA is used to generate multiple tones in base band, from 10 MHz to 250 MHz, which are subsequently mixed to RF in the multiple GHz range and sent through the microwave multiplexer. The tones are generated in theFPGAby storing a large lookup table in Quad Data Rate SRAM modules and playing out the waveform to a DAC board. Once the signal has been modulated to RF, passed through the microwave multiplexer, and has been modulated back to base band, the signal is digitized by an ADC board. The tones are modulated to 0 Hz by using a FPGA circuit consisting of a polyphase filter bank, several Xilinx FFT blocks, Xilinx CORDIC blocks (for converting to magnitude and phase), and special phase accumulator circuit for mixing to exactly 0 Hz. Upwards of 256 channels can be simultaneously captured and written into a bank of 256 First-In-First-Out (FIFO) memories, with each FIFO corresponding to a channel. Individual channel data can be further processed in the FPGA before being streamed through a 10 GB Ethernet fiber-optic interface to a Linux system. The Linux system runs software written in Python and QT C++ for controlling the ROACH system, capturing data, and processing data.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,2179,,,

Data acquisition and analysis are carried out on a microcontroller running an efficient algorithm based on the sliding Discrete Fourier Transform. Despite its low cost, the polarimeter is a fully automatic, research-grade instrument with an accuracy of +/- 0.0013 degrees and a precision of +/- 0.0028 degrees - comparable to far costlier commercial instruments. The polarimeter's ease of use, compact size, fast measurement times and high angular resolution make it a capable and versatile tool for analytical science, while its low cost means it is ideally suited for use in resource-constrained environments and process monitoring.

Electrical stimuli, applied across the mastoid processes, selectively activate primary vestibular afferents which has spurred clinical and biomedical applications of electrical vestibular stimulation (EVS). When properly matched to head motion, EVS may also manipulate the closed-loop relationship between actions and vestibular feedback to reveal the mechanisms of sensorimotor recalibration and learning. New method: We designed a portable, low-cost real-time EVS system using an Arduino microcontroller programmed through Simulink that provides electrical currents based on head angular motion. We used well-characterized vestibular afferent physiological responses to head angular velocity and electrical current to compute head-motion equivalent of real-time modulatory EVS currents. We also examined if our system induced recalibration of the vestibular system during human balance control. Results: Our system operated at 199.997 Hz ( +/- 0.005 Hz) and delivered head-motion-equivalent electrical currents with similar to 10 ms delay. The output driving the current stimulator matched the implemented linear model for physiological vestibular afferent dynamics with minimal background noise (<0.2% of +/- 10 V range). Participants recalibrated to the modulated closed-loop vestibular feedback using visual cues during standing balance, replicating earlier findings. Comparison with existing methods: EVS is typically used to impose external perturbations that are independent of one's own movement. We provided a solution using open-source hardware to implement a real-time, physiology based, and task-relevant vestibular modulations using EVS. Conclusions: Our portable, low-cost vestibular modulation system will make physiological closed-loop vestibular manipulations more accessible thus encouraging novel investigations and biomedical applications of EVS.","[Chen, Anthony; Blouin, Jean-Sebastien] Univ British Columbia, Sch Kinesiol, Vancouver, BC, Canada; [Kuo, Calvin] Univ British Columbia, Sch Biomed Engn, Vancouver, BC, Canada; [Blouin, Jean-Sebastien] Univ British Columbia, Djavad Mowafaghian Ctr Brain Hlth, Vancouver, BC, Canada; [Blouin, Jean-Sebastien] Univ British Columbia, Inst Comp Informat & Cognit Syst, Vancouver, BC, Canada; [Blouin, Jean-Sebastien] 210 6081 Univ Blvd, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z1, Canada",University of British Columbia; University of British Columbia; University of British Columbia; University of British Columbia,"Blouin, JS (corresponding author), 210 6081 Univ Blvd, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z1, Canada.",chen93@student.ubc.ca; calvin.kuo@ubc.ca; jsblouin@mail.ubc.ca,,,,,,,79,4,4,1,2,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0165-0270,1872-678X,,J NEUROSCI METH,J.

This concept harnesses the flexibility of software-defined hardware to implement optoelectronic systems which can be configured to adapt to multiple high speed optical engineering applications. As an application example, a software-defined optical interferometer using a commercial software-defined radio platform is built. The system is tested by performing high speed optical detection of laser-induced photoacoustic signals in a concentrated dye solution. Using software modifications only, conventional single carrier and also multicarrier heterodyne techniques with space and frequency diversity are performed. The latter technique shows a noticeable performance improvement in single-shot interferometric measurements.","[Riobo, Lucas M.; Veiras, Francisco E.; Garea, Maria T.; Sorichetti, Patricio A.] Univ Buenos Aires, Fac Ingn, Dept Fis, GLOmAe, RA-1063 Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina; [Riobo, Lucas M.; Veiras, Francisco E.] Natl Sci & Tech Res Council CONICET, RA-1425 Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina",University of Buenos Aires; Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Cientificas y Tecnicas (CONICET); Centro Nacional Patagonico (CENPAT),"Riob√≥, LM (corresponding author), Univ Buenos Aires, Fac Ingn, Dept Fis, GLOmAe, RA-1063 Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina.",lriobo@conicet.gov.ar,,"Veiras, Francisco Ezequiel/0000-0001-9797-057X; Riobo, Lucas/0000-0003-0142-8693","UBACYT grants from the Universidad de Buenos Aires [20020130100346BA, 20020160100042BA, 20020150200143BA, 20020160100052BA]; ANPCyT [PICT 2016-2204]; CONICET",UBACYT grants from the Universidad de Buenos Aires; ANPCyT(ANPCyT); CONICET(Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Cientificas y Tecnicas (CONICET)),"This work was supported in part by four UBACYT grants from the Universidad de Buenos Aires under Grant 2014-2017 20020130100346BA, Grant 2017-2019 20020160100042BA, Grant 2016-2017 20020150200143BA, and Grant 2017-2019 20020160100052BA, and in part by ANPCyT under Grant PICT 2016-2204.

We show that such an increase in fluorescence emission of extracellular pigment complexes (PC) from these photosynthetic bacteria depends on the concentration of the pigment and temperature and can also be modulated by the static magnetic field. The time-dependent enhanced emission disappears either at or below 300 K or below a threshold sample concentration (0.1 mg/ml). The enhanced emission reappears at this condition (T < 278 K) if a static magnetic field (395 mT) is introduced during fluorescence measurement. The time dependence of emission is expressed in terms of a first-order rate constant, k = dF/(Fdt). The sign of k shifts from positive to negative as PC concentration is lowered than a threshold value, implying onset of fluorescence decay (k < 0) rather than amplification (k > 0). At PC concentration higher than a threshold, k becomes negative if the temperature is lowered. But, surprisingly, at low temperature, a static magnetic field reverts the k value to positive. We explain the logical nature of k-switching and photo-dynamics of the aforesaid microbial fluorescence emission by aggregation of protoporphyrin rings present in the PC. While the simultaneous presence of decay in fluorescence and susceptibility to static magnetic field suggests the dominance of triplet states at low temperatures, the process is reversed by SMF-induced removal of spin degeneracy. At higher temperatures, the optical excitability and lack of magnetic response suggest the dominance of singlet states. We propose that the restructuring of the singlet-triplet distribution by intersystem crossing may be the basis of this logical behaviour. In context with microbial function, time-dependent enhancement of fluorescence also implies relay of red photons to the neighbouring microbes not directly exposed to the incident radiation, thus serving as an indirect photosynthetic regulator.","[Bose, Anirban; Ray, Sanhita; Dasgupta, Anjan Kr] Univ Calcutta, Dept Biochem, Kolkata, India; [Chowdhury, Rajdeep; Nandi, Somen] Indian Assoc Cultivat Sci, Dept Phys Chem, Kolkata, India; [Raja, Sufi O.] Duke Univ, Dept Phys, Durham, NC 27706 USA; [Bhattacharyya, Kankan] IISER, Dept Chem, Bhopal, India",University of Calcutta; Department of Science & Technology (India); Indian Association for the Cultivation of Science (IACS) - Jadavpur; Duke University; Indian Institute of Science Education & Research (IISER) - Bhopal,"Dasgupta, AK (corresponding author), Univ Calcutta, Dept Biochem, Kolkata, India.",anirban2128@gmail.com; rajdeep.873@gmail.com; somchemrnp@gmail.com; sufi.raja@duke.edu; daladysphinc@gmail.com; kankan.bhattacharyya@gmail.com; adbioc@caluniv.ac.in,"Chowdhury, Rajdeep/HZK-8631-2023; Chowdhury, Rajdeep/J-1878-2012; Nandi, Somen/E-1428-2018","Chowdhury, Rajdeep/0000-0002-6717-4721; Raja, Sufi O./0000-0001-5355-1453; Nandi, Somen/0000-0001-8484-761X","MEITy, Govt. of India [13(10)/2016-CC BT]; Department of Biotechnology, Ministry of Science and Technology [BT/PR3957/NNT/28/659/2013]","MEITy, Govt. of India; Department of Biotechnology, Ministry of Science and Technology","We thank MEITy, Govt. of India (Project Open Hardware Based Digital Communicable Biosensing Platform, 13(10)/2016-CC & BT and Department of Biotechnology, Ministry of Science and Technology (BT/PR3957/NNT/28/659/2013).

Weather variables change depending on position and time, especially in tropical zones without seasons. Additionally, the increasing development of precision or smart agriculture makes it necessary to improve the measurement systems while widely distributing them at the location of crops. For these reasons, in this work, the design, construction and fabrication of an adaptable autonomous solar-powered climatic station with wireless 3G or WiFi communication is presented. The station measures relative humidity, temperature, atmospheric pressure, precipitation, wind speed, and light radiation. In addition, the system monitors the charge state of the main battery and the energy generated by the photovoltaic module to act as a reference cell for solar energy generation capability and agrivoltaic potential in the installation area. The station can be remotely controlled and reconfigured. The collected data from all sensors can be uploaded to the cloud in realtime. This initiative aims at enhancing the development of free and open source hardware that can be used by the agricultural sector and that allows professionals in the area to improve harvest yield and production conditions.(c) 2022 The Author(s).

Sophisticated microscopes allowing optical sectioning for three-dimensional imaging or sub-diffraction resolution are available. Due to price and maintenance issues, these microscopes are often shared between users in facilities. Consequently, long-term access is often prohibited and does not allow to monitor slowly evolving biological systems or to validate new models like organoids. Preliminary coarse long-term data that do not require acquisition of terabytes of high-resolution images are important as a first step. By contrast with expensive all-in-one commercialized stations, standard microscopes equipped with incubator stages offer a more cost-effective solution despite imperfect long-run atmosphere and temperature control. Here, we present the Incubascope, a custom-made compact microscope that fits into a table-top incubator. It is cheap and simple to implement, user-friendly and yet provides high imaging performances. The system has a field of view of 5.5 x 8 mm(2), a 3 mu m resolution, a 10 frames per second acquisition rate, and is controlled with a Python-based graphical interface. We exemplify the capabilities of the Incubascope on biological applications such as the hatching of Artemia salina eggs, the growth of the slime mould Physarum polycephalum and of encapsulated spheroids of mammalian cells.","[Badon, A.; Mombereau, A.; Rivet, L.; Boyreau, A.; Nassoy, P.; Recher, G.] Univ Bordeaux, Lab Photon Numer & Nanosci, LP2N, F-33400 Talence, France; [Badon, A.; Mombereau, A.; Rivet, L.; Boyreau, A.; Nassoy, P.; Recher, G.] Inst Opt, Grad Sch, F-33400 Talence, France; [Badon, A.; Mombereau, A.; Rivet, L.; Boyreau, A.; Nassoy, P.; Recher, G.] CNRS, UMR 5298, F-33400 Talence, France; [Andrique, L.] Univ Bordeaux, TBMCore VoxCell Facil, UMS CNRS 3427, US 005,INSERM, F-33076 Bordeaux, France",Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Universite Paris Saclay; Universite de Bordeaux; Universite de Bordeaux; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); CNRS - Institute of Physics (INP); Universite Paris Saclay; Universite de Bordeaux; Institut National de la Sante et de la Recherche Medicale (Inserm); Universite de Bordeaux,"Badon, A (corresponding author), Univ Bordeaux, Lab Photon Numer & Nanosci, LP2N, F-33400 Talence, France.; Badon, A (corresponding author), Inst Opt, Grad Sch, F-33400 Talence, France.; Badon, A (corresponding author), CNRS, UMR 5298, F-33400 Talence, France.",amaury.badon@institutoptique.fr,"Recher, Gaelle/AAB-8218-2019; Badon, Amaury/I-7016-2019","Recher, Gaelle/0000-0001-9004-0118;","Agence Nationale pour le Rcherche [ANR-7-CE30-0007-03, ANR-17-CE18-0026-02, ANR-17-CE13-0012-01]; Canceropole GSO; SIRIC Brio (Bordeaux); Association pour la Recherche sur le Cancer (ARC); La Ligue Contre le Cancer (Gironde and Pyrenees Atlantiques); Fondation des Treilles; Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR) [ANR-17-CE18-0026, ANR-17-CE13-0012] Funding Source: Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR)",Agence Nationale pour le Rcherche(Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR)); Canceropole GSO; SIRIC Brio (Bordeaux); Association pour la Recherche sur le Cancer (ARC)(Fondation ARC pour la Recherche sur le Cancer); La Ligue Contre le Cancer (Gironde and Pyrenees Atlantiques); Fondation des Treilles; Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR)(Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR)),"This work was supported by the Agence Nationale pour le Rcherche (MecaTiss, ANR-7-CE30-0007-03, Parkington, ANR-17-CE18-0026-02, MecanoAdipo, ANR-17-CE13-0012-01), Canceropole GSO, SIRIC Brio (Bordeaux) and the following charities: Association pour la Recherche sur le Cancer (ARC), La Ligue Contre le Cancer (Gironde and Pyrenees Atlantiques).

Though column chro-matography is widely used, to meet their laboratory needs many investigators must resort to designing and fabricating custom racks for holding their chromatography columns. We have created a robust column rack design, with collection vial holders, that is easily made, inexpensive to build, and may be easily adapted to fit experimental needs. The column holder can be made to hold various sizes of columns (and can be interchanged as neces-sary); the height of columns above collection vials can be precisely set; and the design is modular, so the rack and vial holders can be expanded to accommodate the desired num-bers of columns and the numbers and sizes of vials used to collect fractions eluted from each column. Importantly, the rack is made of inexpensive, readily-available materials and the fabrication is straightforward. Here we present details of the rack's features, a list of materials, and instructions for making it. We hope our design will help investigators who perform gravity-driven column chromatography.

Based on the model and the BLE specification for spur emission, a requirement for the PLL fractional spurs is derived. To meet the derived spectral mask by reducing the fractional spurs, a novel synthesizable two-step time to digital converter (TSTDC) that employs embedded TDC (EMBTDC) as coarse and Vernier delay-line TDC (DLTDC) as fine TDC is proposed. We also present a digital calibration scheme to compensate for the nonlinearity induced by the place-and-route (P&R) tool. The PLL is fabricated in 12-nm FinFET and demonstrated in a BLE-TX. The measured BLE transmissions satisfy the standard requirements thanks to the reduced fractional spurs. In a standalone PLL mode, the proposed TSTDC and calibration scheme reduced the fractional spurs by 14.3 dB compared to only using an EMBTDC in near integer N operation. The PLL supports a frequency range of 1.8-2.7 GHz and consumes 3.91 mW at 2.4006 GHz achieving figure of merit (FoM) of -220.7 dB in fractional-N mode with a 40 MHz reference, occupying an area of 0.063 mm(2). A highly automated design flow is used for the PLL to lower the barrier for new developers and reduce the porting cost.","[Kwon, Kyumin; Abdelatty, Omar A.

The focus of this paper is to evaluate three ways of computing/measuring leaf temperature: the LI-COR energy budget computation, the LI-COR leaf thermocouple (T/C), and an infra-red (IR) sensor chip (MLX90615) incorporated into the LI-6400 leaf chamber. The IR-sensor was calibrated against known targets, and then used to cross check the other two methods. The results showed that the IR-sensor was superior to the LI-COR thermocouple and agreed closer with the energy budget values of leaf temperature. The magnitudes of the errors were quantified in terms of degrees C difference in leaf temperature measured by T/C (as control) and IR sensor versus percentage difference in stomatal conductance (g(s)) and intercellular CO2 concentration (C-i) computed from leaf temperature. The temperature difference (IR versus other methods) in the range of -1.89 to 1.58 degrees C resulted in relative errors in g(s) from 14.7% to -18.0% and C-i from 16.5% to -7.8% of the values reported by the standard LI-6400 calculations depending on species and temperature. Reasons are given for trusting the IR-sensor over the other methods and it is suggested that the next generation LI-COR photosynthesis system include an IR-sensor.","[Zhang, Lingling; Zhang, Sheng] Northwest A&F Univ, Coll Forestry, Yangling 712100, Shaanxi, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Sheng] Xinjiang Univ, Coll Life Sci & Technol, Urumqi 830046, Peoples R China",Northwest A&F University - China; Xinjiang University,"Zhang, S (corresponding author), Northwest A&F Univ, Coll Forestry, Yangling 712100, Shaanxi, Peoples R China.",zl524@sina.cn; 251391169@qq.com,"zhang, lingling/HDM-2189-2022",,The Recruitment program of Global Experts' grant in China [Z111021201],The Recruitment program of Global Experts' grant in China,"This work was supported by the 'The Recruitment program of Global Experts' grant in China to Melvin T.

This tension compression nonlinearity enhances interstitial fluid pressurization and decreases the frictional coefficient. The current set of studies examines the tensile and compressive properties of cylindrical chondrocyte-seeded agarose constructs over different developmental stages through a novel method that combines osmotic loading, video microscopy, and uniaxial unconfined compression testing. This method was previously used to examine tension-compression nonlinearity in native cartilage. Engineered cartilage, cultured under free-swelling (FS) or dynamically loaded (DL) conditions, was tested in unconfined compression in hypertonic and hypotonic salt solutions. The apparent equilibrium modulus decreased with increasing salt concentration, indicating that increasing the bath solution osmolarity shielded the fixed charges within the tissue, shifting the measured moduli along the tension-compression curve and revealing the intrinsic properties of the tissue. With this method, we were able to measure the tensile (401 +/- 83 kPa for FS and 678 +/- 473 kPa for DL) and compressive (161 +/- 33 kPa for FS and 348 +/- 203 kPa for DL) moduli of the same engineered cartilage specimens. These moduli are comparable to values obtained from traditional methods, validating this technique for measuring the tensile and compressive properties of hydrogel-based constructs. This study shows that engineered cartilage exhibits tension-compression nonlinearity reminiscent of the native tissue, and that dynamic deformational loading can yield significantly higher tensile properties.

While the localized benefits of active control are well-established, the potential for system-scale control of watersheds is poorly understood. This study shows how a real-world smart stormwater system can be leveraged to shape streamflow within an urban watershed. Specifically, we coordinate releases from two internet-controlled stormwater basins to achieve desired control objectives downstream such as maintaining the flow at a set-point, and generating interleaved waves. In the first part of the study, we describe the construction of the control network using a low-cost, open-source hardware stack and a cloud-based controller scheduling application. Next, we characterize the system's control capabilities by determining the travel times, decay times, and magnitudes of various waves released from the upstream retention basins. With this characterization in hand, we use the system to generate two desired responses at a critical downstream junction. First, we generate a set-point hydrograph, in which flow is maintained at an approximately constant rate. Next, we generate a series of overlapping and interleaved waves using timed releases from both retention basins. We discuss how these control strategies can be used to stabilize flows, thereby mitigating streambed erosion and reducing contaminant loads into downstream waterbodies.","[Mullapudi, Abhiram; Bartos, Matthew; Wong, Brandon; Kerkez, Branko] Univ Michigan, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA",University of Michigan System; University of Michigan,"Kerkez, B (corresponding author), Univ Michigan, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA.",abhiramm@umich.edu; mdbartos@umich.edu; bpwong@umich.edu; bkerkez@umich.edu,,"Wong, Brandon/0000-0002-0109-6150; Mullapudi, Abhiram/0000-0001-8141-3621; Kerkez, Branko/0000-0002-8041-5366; Bartos, Matthew/0000-0001-6421-222X",Great Lakes Protection Fund [1035]; US National Science Foundation [1737432]; University of Michigan,Great Lakes Protection Fund; US National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); University of Michigan(University of Michigan System),"This research was funded by the Great Lakes Protection Fund (Grant 1035), the US National Science Foundation (Grant 1737432) and the University of Michigan.",,24,26,34,1,21,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,1424-8220,,SENSORS-BASEL,Sensors,JUL,2018,18,7,,,,,,,2259,10.3390/s18072259,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/s18072259,,,11,"Chemistry, Analytical; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Instruments & Instrumentation",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Chemistry; Engineering; Instruments & Instrumentation,GQ0UF,30011820,"Green Published, Green Submitted, gold",,,8/15/24,WOS:000441334300281,,0,2201,,,

This application requires dedicated transmit/receive (Tx/Rx) switches that support high peak powers for MRI and high average powers for RF heating. To meet this goal, we propose a high-performance Tx/Rx switch based on positive-intrinsic-negative diodes and quarter-wavelength (lambda/4) stubs. Methods: The lambda/4 stubs in the proposed Tx/Rx switch design route the transmitted RF signal directly to the RF coil/antenna without passing through any electronic components (e.g., positive-intrinsic-negative diodes). Bench measurements, MRI, MR thermometry, and RF heating experiments were performed at f = 297 MHz (B-0 = 7 T) to examine the characteristics and applicability of the switch. Results: The proposed design provided an isolation of -235.7dB/-241.5dB during transmission/reception. The insertion loss was -20.41dB/-20.27dB during transmission/reception. The switch supports high peak (3.9 kW) and high average (120 W) RF powers for MRI and RF heating at f = 297 MHz. High-resolution MRI of the wrist yielded image quality competitive with that obtained with a conventional Tx/Rx switch. Radiofrequency heating in phantom monitored by MR thermometry demonstrated the switch applicability for thermal modulation. Upon these findings, thermally activated release of a model drug attached to thermoresponsive polymers was demonstrated. Conclusion: The high-power Tx/Rx switch enables thermal MR applications at 7 T, contributing to the study of the role of temperature in biological systems and diseases.

MKIDs feature intrinsic frequency domain multiplexing (FDM) at microwave frequencies, allowing the construction and readout of large arrays. Due to the microwave FDM, MKIDs do not require the complex cryogenic multiplexing electronics used for similar detectors, such as transition edge sensors, but instead transfer this complexity to room temperature electronics where they present a formidable signal processing challenge. In this paper, we describe the first successful effort to build a readout for a photon counting optical/near-IR astronomical instrument, the ARray Camera for Optical to Near-infrared Spectrophotometry.

However, many individuals with hearing loss are dissatisfied with the quality of modern hearing aids. Amplification is the main method of compensating for hearing loss in modern hearing aids. One common amplification technique is dynamic range compression, which maps audio signals onto a person's hearing range using an amplification curve. However, due to the frequency dependent nature of the human cochlea, compression is often performed independently in different frequency bands. This paper presents a real-time multirate multiband amplification system for hearing aids, which includes a multirate channelizer for separating an audio signal into eleven standard audiometric frequency bands, and an automatic gain control system for accurate control of the steady state and dynamic behavior of audio compression as specified by ANSI standards. The spectral channelizer offers high frequency resolution with low latency of 5.4 ms and about 14x improvement in complexity over a baseline design. Our automatic gain control includes a closed-form solution for satisfying any designated attack and release times for any desired compression parameters. The increased frequency resolution and precise gain adjustment allow our system to more accurately fulfill audiometric hearing aid prescriptions.","[Sokolova, Alice; Hunt, Martin; Harris, Fredric] Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Sokolova, Alice; Aksanli, Baris] San Diego State Univ, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, San Diego, CA 92182 USA; [Sengupta, Dhiman; Gupta, Rajesh] Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Comp Sci & Engn, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Gupta, Rajesh] Halicioglu Data Sci Inst, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Garudadri, Harinath] Univ Calif San Diego, Qualcomm Inst Calit2, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA",University of California System; University of California San Diego; California State University System; San Diego State University; University of California System; University of California San Diego; University of California System; University of California San Diego,"Sokolova, A (corresponding author), Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA.; Sokolova, A (corresponding author), San Diego State Univ, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, San Diego, CA 92182 USA.",aasokolo@ucsd.edu,,"Sokolova, Alice/0000-0001-5862-0374; Aksanli, Baris/0000-0001-6347-9061","National Institute of Health, NIH/National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders (NIDCD) [R21DC015046, R33DC015046]; National Institute of Health, NIH/NIDCD [R01DC015436]; Division of Information and Intelligent Systems, University of California San Diego [IIS-1838897]; Qualcomm Institute, University of California San Diego (UCSD); Halicioglu Data Science Institute, UCSD; Wrethinking, the Foundation","National Institute of Health, NIH/National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders (NIDCD); National Institute of Health, NIH/NIDCD(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute on Deafness & Other Communication Disorders (NIDCD)); Division of Information and Intelligent Systems, University of California San Diego; Qualcomm Institute, University of California San Diego (UCSD); Halicioglu Data Science Institute, UCSD; Wrethinking, the Foundation","This work was supported in part by the National Institute of Health, NIH/National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders (NIDCD), under Grant R21DC015046 and Grant R33DC015046 (Self-~tting of Ampli~cation: Methodology and Candidacy); in part by the National Institute of Health, NIH/NIDCD, under Grant R01DC015436 (A Real-time, Open, Portable, Extensible Speech Laboratory); in part by the Division of Information and Intelligent Systems, University of California San Diego, under Grant IIS-1838897 (A Framework for Optimizing Hearing Aids In Situ Based on Patient Feedback, Auditory Context, and Audiologist Input); in part by the Qualcomm Institute, University of California San Diego (UCSD); in part by the Hal~c~o lu Data Science Institute, UCSD; and in part by the Wrethinking, the Foundation.",,26,3,5,1,2,IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC,PISCATAWAY,"445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA",2169-3536,,,IEEE ACCESS,IEEE Access,,2022,10,,,,,,54301,54312,,10.1109/ACCESS.2022.3176368,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2022.3176368,,,12,"Computer Science, Information Systems; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Telecommunications",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Computer Science; Engineering; Telecommunications,1N6RP,37309510,"Green Submitted, gold, Green Accepted",,,8/15/24,WOS:000800780700001,,0,2204,,,

Energy storage will be needed to take full advantage of abundant but intermittent energy sources. Even with economies of scale, the price is prohibitively high for a lithium-ion battery pack capable of storing tens of kilowatts of energy for many consumers. A more abundant and less expensive material is necessary. All-iron chemistry presents a transformative opportunity for stationary energy storage: it is simple, cheap, abundant, and safe. All-iron batteries can store energy by reducing iron (II) to metallic iron at the anode and oxidizing iron (II) to iron (III) at the cathode. The total cell is highly stable, efficient, non-toxic, and safe. The total cost of materials is $0.1 per watt-hour of capacity at wholesale prices. This battery may be a useful component of open source hardware projects that require a safe and ecologically friendly battery.

In this work, we aimed to image scanned proton beams with greater flexibility than is provided by previous systems by using an innovative camera triggering solution. The main objective was to synchronize image acquisitions with proton beam deliveries. A 3D detector composed of 3 scientific complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor cameras and a volumetric liquid scintillator (20 x20x 20 cm) were used. We identified relevant signals from the synchrotron beam delivery system to trigger the cameras. These signals were processed using an open hardware microcontroller and monitored using an oscilloscope. We evaluated the camera triggering scheme by comparing the mean signal intensity and standard deviations for triggered versus non-triggered image acquisitions at 5 energies (161.6, 140.9, 124.0, 100.9, and 85.6 MeV) with 50 spots per energy. The performance of the triggering scheme was further investigated by testing the image intensity variability for 5 energies delivered at 9 different location (2 spots/location). We also measured the background signals for different exposure times (1-1000 ms) using both triggered and non-triggered schemes. The mean signal intensity difference between triggered and non-triggered schemes was 10% +/- 0.4% for low SNR (similar to 20 dB). The image intensity variability was within 2%. The background signal intensity varied by only 0.6% from the shortest exposure time (1 ms) to the longest (1 s). We demonstrated a flexible triggering scheme using an open hardware microcontroller with a camera and scintillator detector system for a spot scanning proton beam, which will enable efficient machine quality assurance and treatment plan verification measurements in the future.","[Alsanea, Fahed; Darne, Chinmay; Hojo, Yoshifumi; Beddar, Sam] Univ Texas MD Anderson Canc Ctr, Dept Radiat Phys, 1515 Holcombe Blvd,Unit 94, Houston, TX 77030 USA; [Alsanea, Fahed; Beddar, Sam] Univ Texas MD Anderson UTHlth, Grad Sch Biomed Sci, 6767 Bertner Ave, Houston, TX 77030 USA",University of Texas System; UTMD Anderson Cancer Center; University of Texas System; UTMD Anderson Cancer Center,"Beddar, S (corresponding author), Univ Texas MD Anderson Canc Ctr, Dept Radiat Phys, 1515 Holcombe Blvd,Unit 94, Houston, TX 77030 USA.",abeddar@mdanderson.org,,"Beddar, Sam/0000-0001-5825-110X; Alsanea, Fahed/0000-0001-5491-6565",National Cancer Institute of the National Institutes of Health [R01CA182450],National Cancer Institute of the National Institutes of Health(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Cancer Institute (NCI)),"The authors would like to thank Dr. Narayan Sahoo for his help with proton beam measurements, and Dr. Jim Bankson for his help with trigger equipment testing.

These methods are basically based on the recording of seismic ambient noise and analysis of its spectral features. Although these techniques are more practical than traditional seismic methods, the commercial instruments designed for recording the seismic ambient noise are quite expensive. Furthermore, most of these instruments require an external computer for recording and monitoring the data. In this sense, this article intends to present a low-cost and Raspberry Pi single-board microcomputer aided seismic ambient noise recording and monitoring system (RaspMI) as an alternative to the computer aided commercial seismic noise measurement systems. RaspMI is an open-source hardware and software system that is controlled by a graphical user interface developed by using the MonoDevelop cross-platform and C# programming language. This system has many features such as 72 dB dynamic range, 100 Hz sampling frequency, timer recording mode, text and SAC data file format, and latitude, longitude, date and time support with GPS module. RaspMI has subjected to the various tests in terms of the reliability and sensitivity.

However, the systems for detecting the fluorophores remain expensive and thus inaccessible to many. Most commercial systems are often only optimized for one specific application, making reuse difficult. This paper demonstrates, characterizes and evaluates an inexpensive and versatile system for the detection of fluorophores with two wavelengths using high power LEDs. The LEDs are arranged in two banks angled downward at a tray in a way that allows for bright and uniform illumination while preventing direct reflections into the camera. The emitted light is filtered through an exchangeable filter frame and can be detected using the camera of a smartphone or similar device. By using filters both in front of the LEDs and the camera, very low background and using sufficient exposure times, very high sensitivity can be achieved. The two wavelengths of excitation light and the exchangeable filters allow for optimization for the specific fluorophore used and thus highest brightness.& COPY; 2023 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Here we describe a high-performance, low-cost, open hardware pressure ejection system (Openspritzer), which can be constructed from off the shelf components. The device is capable of delivering minute doses of reagents to a wide range of biological and chemical systems. In this work, we characterise the performance of the device and compare it to a popular commercial system using twophoton fluorescence microscopy. We found that Openspritzer provides the same level of control over delivered reagent dose as the commercial system. Next, we demonstrate the utility of Openspritzer in a series of standard neurobiological applications. First, we used Openspritzer to deliver precise amounts of reagents to hippocampal neurons to elicit time-and dose-precise responses on neuronal voltage. Second, we used Openspritzer to deliver infectious viral and bacterial agents to living tissue. This included viral transfection of hippocampal interneurons with channelrhodopsin for the optogenetic manipulation of hippocampal circuitry with light. We anticipate that due to its high performance and low cost Openspritzer will be of interest to a broad range of researchers working in the life and physical sciences.","[Forman, C.

The monolithic block makes the instrument compact, lightweight, stiff, and resistant to drift, as well as minimizing alignment during assembly and minimizing cost. Our openly licensed design together with our use of digital fabrication makes this autocollimator convenient to customize or integrate into larger instruments.

Calibration of the tracker position and orientation is a fundamental task to correct systematic errors. This article explores the effect of metallic distortion on the open hardware Anser EMT system and describes a newly developed approach for volume calibration of the magnetic field model. The technique is also applied to effectively map the field in the presence of magnetic shields that can be used to reduce electromagnetic distortions passively. Unlike calibration techniques commonly found in literature, which aim to correct the tracking position error, our method can reconstruct an analytical magnetic field model starting from a reduced amount of scattered data. This way, a faster convergence of the solver algorithm is obtained, and EMT position and orientation errors are inherently corrected. The new modeling technique was applied to generate a new, undistorted magnetic field model for Anser EMT, to demonstrate the effectiveness of passive shielding, and to compensate for the distortion introduced by a commercial fluoroscopy C-arm. Furthermore, the concept of a real-time distortion compensation technique is expressed based on the modeling method presented in this article. For all the experiments, sub-millimeter errors were obtained after calibration, which may meet the needs of most endoscopic and surgical navigation tasks.","[Cavaliere, Marco; Crowley, Daragh; Jaeger, Herman Alexander; Cantillon-Murphy, Padraig] Univ Coll Cork, Dept Elect & Elect Engn, Cork T12 K8AF, Ireland; [Cavaliere, Marco; Crowley, Daragh; Jaeger, Herman Alexander; O'Donoghue, Kilian; Cantillon-Murphy, Padraig] Tyndall Natl Inst, Microelect Circuits Ctr Ireland MCCI, Cork T12 R5CP, Ireland",University College Cork,"Cavaliere, M (corresponding author), Univ Coll Cork, Dept Elect & Elect Engn, Cork T12 K8AF, Ireland.; Cavaliere, M (corresponding author), Tyndall Natl Inst, Microelect Circuits Ctr Ireland MCCI, Cork T12 R5CP, Ireland.",m.cavaliere.ucc@gmail.com,,"Cantillon-Murphy, Padraig/0000-0001-6679-2889; Jaeger, Herman Alexander/0000-0003-4771-8469; Crowley, Daragh/0000-0002-4268-7504; Cavaliere, Marco/0000-0003-1901-0041",,,,,52,0,0,3,11,IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC,PISCATAWAY,"445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA",0018-9464,1941-0069,,IEEE T MAGN,IEEE Trans.

Anion-exchange membranes provide an alkaline environment, allowing CO2 reduction at low cell voltages and suppression of hydrogen evolution while maintaining high conversion efficiencies. However, the local alkaline conditions and the presence of alkali cations lead to problematic carbonate formation and even precipitation. Here we report a pure-water-fed (alkali-cation-free) membrane-electrode-assembly system for CO2 reduction to ethylene by integrating an anion-exchange membrane and a proton-exchange membrane at the cathode and anode side, respectively, under forward bias. This system effectively suppresses carbonate formation and prevents salt precipitation.

In most of these instruments, sample injection is effected manually with low to moderate precision and requires skilled operators. Although few automated samplers have been previously developed, typically only one sample at a time can be injected. If a series of samples is to be analyzed, manual intervention is required. In the present work, we developed and constructed a fully automated, open source, CE autosampler, able to handle up to 14 different samples that can be used as a modular component of any in-house built CE instrument. Results: An inexpensive, 3D printed, open source, autosampler for CE was developed. The autosampler consists of two parts: an injection unit with carousel containing sample and electrolyte vials and a flushing unit, containing a miniature pressure/vacuum pump. The autosampler is operated by an Arduino Mega microcontroller and an Arduino code written in the laboratory. The injection sequence is entered through a keypad and LCD display by the user. The instrument can operate autonomously for extended periods of time. It was used for fully automated analysis and/or calibration of up to 14 samples with excellent injection repeatability reaching less than 2.7% RSD for peak areas. The sampler performance was tested with two independently built CE instruments, a CE system with contactless conductivity detection (C4D) and a CE system with laser induced fluorescence (LIF) detector.Significance and novelty: A novel, 3D printed, Arduino-based autosampler for CE was developed. The autosampler allows autonomous hydrodynamic injection of up to 14 different samples with fully programmable injection sequence, including capillary flushing and high voltage and data acquisition control. It provides the missing instrumental sampling setup for laboratory made CE instruments. It can be simply constructed based on the open -source blueprints in any laboratory and be a useful and time-saving add-on to any modular CE instrument.","[Itterheimova, Petra; Kuban, Petr] Acad Sci Czech Republ, Inst Analyt Chem, Dept Bioanalyt Instrumentat, Veveri 97, Brno 60200, Czech Republic; [Itterheimova, Petra] CEITEC Masaryk Univ, Kamenice 5, Brno 62500, Czech Republic",Czech Academy of Sciences; Institute of Analytical Chemistry of the Czech Academy of Sciences; Masaryk University Brno,"Kub√°n, P (corresponding author), Acad Sci Czech Republ, Inst Analyt Chem, Dept Bioanalyt Instrumentat, Veveri 97, Brno 60200, Czech Republic.",,,"Itterheimova, Petra/0000-0002-1203-5441; Kuban, Petr/0000-0002-4056-5570",Czech Science Foundation [22-23815S],Czech Science Foundation(Grant Agency of the Czech Republic),Martin Kuban is acknowledged for his help with writing the Arduino code.

The instrument has been designed to allow transient absorption spectroscopy measurements of either low or high quantum yield processes by combining intense sub-microsecond excitation flashes using a xenon lamp together with stroboscopic non-actinic white light probing using LED sources driven under high pulsed current from a capacitor bank. The instrument is sensitive to resolve 0.15 mOD flash-induced differences within 1000 measurements at 20 Hz repetition rate using an inexpensive CCD sensor with 200 mu m pixel dimension, 40 K electrons full well capacity and a dynamic range of 1800. The excitation flash has 230 ns pulse duration and the 2 mJ flash energy allows spectral filtering while retaining high power density with focussing to generate mOD signals in the 10(-4)-10(-1) Delta OD range. We present the full electronics design and construction of the flash and probe sources, the optics as well as the timing electronics and CCD spectrometer operation and modification for internal signal referencing. The performance characterisation and example measurements are demonstrated using microsecond TAS of Congo red dye, as an example of a low quantum yield photoreaction at 2% with up to 78% of molecules excited. The instrument is fully open hardware and combines inexpensive selection of commercial components, optics and electronics and allows linear response measurements of photoinduced reactions for the purpose of accurate global analysis of chemical dynamics.","[Hutchison, Christopher D.

Imaging instruments have enabled in situ observations of these organisms that can be automated and are less invasive than traditional sampling methods. However, these instruments are often costly and require sophisticated engineering expertise to operate. The In situ Plankton Assemblage eXplorer (IPAX) is an open-source low-cost imaging platform for zooplankton studies. The IPAX is a programmable instrument that has powerful LED illumination and a high-resolution camera that can image zooplankton in situ, while material costs are less than USD $450. The optical performance of the instrument was calibrated in the laboratory using a calibration target and preserved zooplankton. The IPAX was then deployed in the field to observe diversity, emergent patterns and phototactic behaviour of demersal zooplankton at night to demonstrate its practicality. Laboratory calibration indicated that the IPAX can resolve 100 mu m features with 70% contrast at the focal plane with 5 cm x 3 cm field of view and 5 mm depth of field. The instrument also resolved fine morphological details of preserved zooplankton when in focus. The field deployment demonstrated capability to resolve the myriad of zooplankton present in addition to the different phototactic behaviour that was elicited and observed from the different colour LEDs. The IPAX enables economical and autonomous surveys of zooplankton in various aquatic habitats. Its low cost facilitates construction and deployment of multiple units that can cover large spatial areas, while its versatility also allows adaptations to many experimental needs for aquatic ecology.","[Lertvilai, Pichaya] Univ Calif San Diego, Scripps Inst Oceanog, San Diego, CA 92093 USA",University of California System; University of California San Diego; Scripps Institution of Oceanography,"Lertvilai, P (corresponding author), Univ Calif San Diego, Scripps Inst Oceanog, San Diego, CA 92093 USA.",plertvil@ucsd.edu,"Lertvilai, Pichaya/HMP-4374-2023","Lertvilai, Pichaya/0000-0002-5903-1798",,,,,20,18,20,0,8,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",2041-210X,2041-2096,,METHODS ECOL EVOL,Methods Ecol.

Transferring data over a network without requiring any kind of human-to-computer or human-to-human interaction, brings reliability and convenience to consumers, but also opens a new world of opportunity for intruders, and introduces a whole set of unique and complicated questions to the field of Digital Forensics. Although IoT data could be a rich source of evidence, forensics professionals cope with diverse problems, starting from the huge variety of IoT devices and non-standard formats, to the multi-tenant cloud infrastructure and the resulting multi-jurisdictional litigations. A further challenge is the end-to-end encryption which represents a trade-off between users‚Äô right to privacy and the success of the forensics investigation. Due to its volatile nature, digital evidence has to be acquired and analyzed using validated tools and techniques that ensure the maintenance of the Chain of Custody. Therefore, the purpose of this paper is to identify and discuss the main issues involved in the complex process of IoT-based investigations, particularly all legal, privacy and cloud security challenges. Furthermore, this work provides an overview of the past and current theoretical models in the digital forensics science. Special attention is paid to frameworks that aim to extract data in a privacy-preserving manner or secure the evidence integrity using decentralized blockchain-based solutions.

As the capabilities of robotic software frameworks increase, the setup difficulty and learning curve for new users also increase. If the entry barriers for configuring and using the software on robots is too high, even the most powerful of frameworks are useless. A growing need exists in robotic software engineering to aid users in getting started with, and customizing, the software framework as necessary for particular robotic applications. In this paper a case study is presented for the best practices found for lowering the barrier of entry in the MoveIt! framework, an open-source tool for mobile manipulation in ROS, that allows users to 1) quickly get basic motion planning functionality with minimal initial setup, 2) automate its configuration and optimization, and 3) easily customize its components. A graphical interface that assists the user in configuring MoveIt! is the cornerstone of our approach, coupled with the use of an existing standardized robot model for input, automatically generated robot-specific configuration files, and a plugin-based architecture for extensibility. These best practices are summarized into a set of barrier to entry design principles applicable to other robotic software.

Such a passport may document non-observable attributes of products, such as their age, people involved in their creation, the licenses of designs used, locations they have travelled to and their current owner. In our tentative implementation and proposal for standard components, we focus on adopting a graph database of information, the REA (Resource-Event-Agent) accounting system and the Valueflows vocabulary to trace resources, events, and agents. Working in a federated environment where DPPs can be exported and authenticated even when they cross different contexts, we also examine how cryptography is used to ensure the integrity of DPPs by relying on authenticity rather than authorization.",https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/978-3-658-44114-2_8,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,1525,,,

While others have studied the importance of data, hardware, and models in directing the trajectory of AI, we argue that open source software is a neglected factor shaping AI as a discipline. We start with the observation that almost all AI research and applications are built on machine learning open source software (MLOSS). This paper presents three contributions. First, it quantifies the outsized impact of MLOSS by using Github contributions data. By contrasting the costs of MLOSS and its economic benefits, we find that the average dollar of MLOSS investment corresponds to at least \$100 of global economic value created, corresponding to \$30B of economic value created this year. Second, we leverage interviews with AI researchers and developers to develop a causal model of the effect of open sourcing on economic value. We argue that open sourcing creates value through three primary mechanisms: standardization of MLOSS tools, increased experimentation in AI research, and creation of communities. Finally, we consider the incentives for developing MLOSS and the broader implications of these effects. We intend this paper to be useful for technologists and academics who want to analyze and critique AI, and policymakers who want to better understand and regulate AI systems.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,1799,,,

Increased specimen thickness degrades resolution with beam broadening alongside loss of contrast. The large inelastic cross-section of carbon hampers accurate atomic species detection. Oxygen and water molecules pose problems of lattice damage by chemically etching the specimen during imaging. These constraints on high-resolution and spectroscopic imaging demand clean, high-vacuum microscopes with dry pumps. Here, we present an open-hardware design of a high-vacuum manifold for transmission electron microscopy (TEM) holders to mitigate hydrocarbon and residual species exposure. We quantitatively show that TEM holders are inherently dirty and introduce a range of unwanted chemical species. Overnight storage in our manifold reduces contaminants by one to two orders of magnitude and promotes two to four times faster vacuum recovery. A built-in bakeout system further reduces contaminants partial pressure to below 10(-10 )hPa (Torr) (approximately four orders of magnitude down from ambient storage) and alleviates monolayer adsorption during a typical TEM experiment. We determine that bakeout of TEM holder with specimen held therein is the optimal cleaning method. Our high-vacuum manifold design is published with open-source blueprints, parts, and cost list.","[Goh, Yin Min] Univ Michigan, Dept Phys, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Schwartz, Jonathan; Hovden, Robert] Univ Michigan, Dept Mat Sci & Engn, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Rennich, Emily] Univ Michigan, Dept Mech Engn, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Ma, Tao] Univ Michigan, Michigan Ctr Mat Characterizat, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Kerns, Bobby; Hovden, Robert] Univ Michigan, Appl Phys Program, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA",University of Michigan System; University of Michigan; University of Michigan System; University of Michigan; University of Michigan System; University of Michigan; University of Michigan System; University of Michigan; University of Michigan System; University of Michigan,"Hovden, R (corresponding author), Univ Michigan, Dept Mat Sci & Engn, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA.; Hovden, R (corresponding author), Univ Michigan, Appl Phys Program, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA.",hovden@umich.edu,"ma, tao/JTS-7892-2023; Hovden, Robert/E-8104-2011","Goh, Yin Min/0000-0003-3692-8372; Schwartz, Jonathan/0000-0002-8063-6951; Rennich, Emily/0000-0002-9147-4708; Kerns, Robert/0009-0006-2824-6258",National Science Foundation (NSF) [18073984],National Science Foundation (NSF)(National Science Foundation (NSF)),"The authors recognize support and inspiration from other facilities with custom in-house TEM manifolds-Cornell University (Malcolm Thomas, Lena F.

Aluminum oxide, boron nitride, and titanium nitride coatings were evaluated as possible substrate release agents for aluminum printing. Additionally, the in situ formation of substrate release agents such as intermetallics and oxides were tested for both aluminum and steel printing. Testing was performed with a modified Charpy impact tester to remove 3D printed metal parts from an 1100 aluminum or A36 low carbon steel print substrate to assess the impact energy required for removal. Specimen porosity was measured prior to sectioning and microstructural analysis, hardness traverses were measured across the specimens, and the elastic and shear moduli of the parts were analyzed via ultrasonic methods. All of the employed substrate release mechanisms minimized weld penetration and, in some instances, formed a brittle phase with the print substrate that allowed the specimens to be removed with minimal impact energy. These results thus provide methods with the removal of metal 3-D printed parts from print substrates with no specialized tooling or equipment conducive to distributed manufacturing.

ROACH is an open-source hardware and software platform featuring a large Xilinx Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA), Power PC processor, several 10 GB Ethernet SFP+ interfaces, and a collection of daughter boards for analog signal generation and acquisition. The combination of a ROACH board, ADC/DAC conversion daughter boards, and hardware for RF mixing allows for the generation and capture of multiple RF tones for reading out microwave multiplexed X-ray TES microcalorimeters. The FPGA is used to generate multiple tones in base band, from 10 MHz to 250 MHz, which are subsequently mixed to RF in the multiple GHz range and sent through the microwave multiplexer. The tones are generated in theFPGAby storing a large lookup table in Quad Data Rate SRAM modules and playing out the waveform to a DAC board. Once the signal has been modulated to RF, passed through the microwave multiplexer, and has been modulated back to base band, the signal is digitized by an ADC board. The tones are modulated to 0 Hz by using a FPGA circuit consisting of a polyphase filter bank, several Xilinx FFT blocks, Xilinx CORDIC blocks (for converting to magnitude and phase), and special phase accumulator circuit for mixing to exactly 0 Hz. Upwards of 256 channels can be simultaneously captured and written into a bank of 256 First-In-First-Out (FIFO) memories, with each FIFO corresponding to a channel. Individual channel data can be further processed in the FPGA before being streamed through a 10 GB Ethernet fiber-optic interface to a Linux system. The Linux system runs software written in Python and QT C++ for controlling the ROACH system, capturing data, and processing data.","[Madden, Timothy J.; Cecil, Thomas W.; Gades, Lisa M.; Quaranta, Orlando; Yan, Daikang; Miceli, Antonino] Argonne Natl Lab, 9700 S Cass Ave, Argonne, IL 60439 USA; [Yan, Daikang] Northwestern Univ, Evanston, IL 60208 USA; [Becker, Dan T.; Bennett, Doug A.; Hays-Wehle, James P.; Hilton, Gene C.; Reintsema, Carl D.; Schmidt, Dan R.; Swetz, Daniel S.; Vale, Leila R.; Ullom, Joel N.] NIST, Boulder, CO 80305 USA; [Becker, Dan T.; Gard, Johnathon D.; Mates, John A.

As we gain more insight into the genomic basis of pathogen infectivity and drug resistance, point-of-care nucleic acid testing will likely become an important tool for global health. In this paper, we present an inexpensive, handheld, battery-powered instrument designed to enable pathogen genotyping in the developing world. Our Microfluidic Biomolecular Amplification Reader (mBAR) represents the convergence of molecular biology, microfluidics, optics, and electronics technology. The mBAR is capable of carrying out isothermal nucleic acid amplification assays with real-time fluorescence readout at a fraction of the cost of conventional benchtop thermocyclers. Additionally, the mBAR features cell phone data connectivity and GPS sample geotagging which can enable epidemiological surveying and remote healthcare delivery. The mBAR controls assay temperature through an integrated resistive heater and monitors real-time fluorescence signals from 60 individual reaction chambers using LEDs and phototransistors. Assays are carried out on PDMS disposable microfluidic cartridges which require no external power for sample loading. We characterize the fluorescence detection limits, heater uniformity, and battery life of the instrument. As a proof-of-principle, we demonstrate the detection of the HIV-1 integrase gene with the mBAR using the Loop-Mediated Isothermal Amplification (LAMP) assay. Although we focus on the detection of purified DNA here, LAMP has previously been demonstrated with a range of clinical samples, and our eventual goal is to develop a microfluidic device which includes on-chip sample preparation from raw samples. The mBAR is based entirely around open source hardware and software, and in the accompanying online supplement we present a full set of schematics, bill of materials, PCB layouts, CAD drawings, and source code for the mBAR instrument with the goal of spurring further innovation toward low-cost genetic diagnostics.","[Myers, Frank B.; Henrikson, Richard H.; Lee, Luke P.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Bioengn, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Myers, Frank B.; Henrikson, Richard H.; Lee, Luke P.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Berkeley Sensor & Actuator Ctr, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Bone, Jennifer] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Phys, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA",University of California System; University of California Berkeley; University of California System; University of California Berkeley; University of California System; University of California Berkeley,"Lee, LP (corresponding author), Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Bioengn, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",lplee@berkeley.edu,"Lee, Luke P/AAN-6695-2021",,DSO of Defense Advanced Research Project Agency (DxOD project); Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation; NDSEG; Siebel Scholarship,DSO of Defense Advanced Research Project Agency (DxOD project); Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation(Bill & Melinda Gates FoundationBill & Melinda Gates Foundation Grand Challenges Explorations InitiativeCGIAR); NDSEG; Siebel Scholarship,"This work was supported by the DSO of Defense Advanced Research Project Agency (DxOD project) and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation (Grand Challenges).
