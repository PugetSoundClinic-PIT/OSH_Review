First, we provided a qualitative and quantitative framework to assess modularity in OSH, drawing mainly from the literature of network science. Second, we presented a tentative classification of modularity types, attempting to address the full range of OSH development. Interestingly, intangible design, fabrication and macro modularity types are unique in the OSH realm and are presented and defined herein, to our knowledge, for the first time. Such a framework and classification may be integral for future systematic research in OSH modularity. Moreover, our quantitative analysis introduced preliminary evidence to argue that intangible design modularisation is more effective than exclusively physical modularisation strategies. Our final remark is that the 'mirroring hypothesis' is not a universal pattern in OSH. The selection of design tools as well as the modularisation strategy (ex ante or ex post) may affect the levels of modularity types.""

- ""More generally, MakerBot demonstrates how openness both enables and limits the entrepreneurial strategies of new firms.""
- ""The availability of open source technology reduces entry barriers, enabling the formation and market entry of new firms.""
- ""Such an external innovation community is an example of a complementary asset as defined by Teece (1986).""
- ""Given these financial constraints, we would expect that new firms (particularly resource-limited ones) will be more open than established firms with greater resources.""
- ""Proposition 1: For firms that require new complementary assets to commercialize their innovation, new firms will be more willing than established firms to source these assets as generic assets.""
- ""Proposition 2: Among new firms that require new complementary assets to commercialize their innovation, their willingness to source these assets as generic assets decreases as the availability of financial capital increases.""
- ""Proposition 3: After firms receive venture or other professional investment, their openness will decrease more rapidly than those that do not receive such investment.""
- ""Proposition 4: When a firm switches from an open to partly closed strategy, ceteris paribus, it will make proprietary those parts most important to its value proposition.""
- ""Proposition 5: Firms are most likely to make proprietary those components that are most difficult to obtain from external contributors, or most difficult to assimilate when provided by external sources.""

REASONING:
- The discussion section focuses on the concept of ""complementarity of openness,"" which is how openness can support a firm's proprietary strategy.
- The paper uses MakerBot as a case study to illustrate how firms can strategically use openness to create and capture value.
- The discussion highlights that openness can reduce entry barriers for new firms, allowing them to enter markets more easily.
- The paper proposes several propositions about how firms might strategically balance open and proprietary elements, especially in relation to financial resources and competitive advantage.
- The discussion suggests that new firms are more likely to be open due to resource constraints, but this openness may decrease with increased financial investment.
- The paper concludes that firms will make proprietary those parts of their business that are most critical to their value proposition or difficult to source externally.

The answer is: The discussion highlights the complementarity of openness, illustrating how MakerBot strategically used open community strategies to create and capture value, proposing that openness supports proprietary strategies and vice versa, especially for new firms with limited resources.

- ""The disadvantages of the metal are that it is less easy to work with than wood and may be more likely to be stolen in some areas than wood.""

REASONING:
- The paper discusses the geographical dependence of material availability and cost, which limits the universal applicability of the designs.
- The need to substitute materials due to availability issues indicates a limitation in sourcing consistent materials across different locations.
- The variability in material prices and effectiveness across locations suggests a limitation in cost predictability and economic optimization.
- The dependency of racking system lifetimes on local weather conditions highlights a limitation in durability and reliability across different environments.
- The novelty of the systems and lack of vendor support as kits with warranties is a limitation in terms of market acceptance and consumer confidence.
- The need for further optimization and adaptation to local building codes suggests limitations in the current design's applicability and efficiency.
- The specific disadvantages of wood and metal racks, such as additional grounding requirements and susceptibility to theft or sabotage, are limitations in practical implementation.

REASONING:
- The discussion emphasizes the importance of local optimization for open hardware designs, suggesting that material availability should guide design choices.
- It highlights the economic differences in material costs across different regions, indicating that these differences affect the generalizability of open hardware technologies.
- The paper suggests that flexibility in design and material selection enhances the likelihood of a design being considered an open-source appropriate technology (OSAT).
- The study concludes that the appropriateness and cost-effectiveness of open hardware technologies are highly dependent on geographical location and local economic conditions.
- The discussion also notes that while open-source wood-based solar PV racking systems can support DIY and DIT models, they may not always be the most economical choice depending on regional material availability and costs.

The answer is: The discussion concludes that open hardware designs should allow for local optimization based on material availability, as their appropriateness and cost-effectiveness are highly location-dependent.
